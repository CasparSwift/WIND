i 'm not sure why sony which now owns i dream of jeannie decided to colorize the first season of this series whatever the reason you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on that the original version of the first season is worth a lot more the reason for that is simple i dream of jeannie was originally broadcast in and for a television fan like myself that 's the only way to watch the first season the episodes themselves are just as i remember seeing them since i was n't around in 1965 i 'm pretty sure i 've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here but to me they 're still pretty good the theme music in my opinion is every bit as good as the second theme introduced when jeannie went to color in 1966. the one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that sony stripped off the old screen gems animation from the end of every episode that logo was attached to so many classic shows from the and and it is consistenly rated along with viacom 's old blue v of doom as the scariest logo in the history of television the new sony outro does n't pack the same punch still if you liked jeannie way back when you 'll love it now especially since you can watch it anytime you like without commercial interruption
if you do n't own this dvd you need to add it to your collection in my opinion it is the best american animated film ever released
denzel washington is great but angelina jolie he is even better the movie itself is pretty scary to tell you the truth it 's not pleasant there are some parts you do n't really need to see the plot of the movie is interesting and keeps you wondering what is gon na happen next i recommend watching it with somebody cause it 's not pretty but it 's a good movie
i rediscovered this after a long time this is a great had never seen this in its entirety and look forward to seeing the third and fourth which i understand is not out a gem love the storyline and so authentic looking and of the period even the wish there were more of this genre
i bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me i enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also times and styles may have changed but i believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did simple but great movie my only regret is that it was n't close captioned

9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling it takes a look at the workplace from a woman 's view we first meet violet lily tomlin who has been working for consolidated companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them she trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it judy jane fonda is the new girl in the office she is a divorcee he left her for his secretary and has never worked for a living rounding out the heroines is doralee dolly parton in the film debut she is the personal secretary of franklin hart dabney coleman and everyone thinks she is banging the boss '' but the fun starts when violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train she then blurts out that hart has been spreading rumors that he 's been having an affair with doralee and an employee is fired for a small infraction this sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss judy is a big game hunter with hart as the prey doralee plays role reversal and hart ends up on a rotisserie spit but violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is snow white and the wicked witch and poisons hart the next day violet accidentally poisons hart 's coffee when falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious violet thinks she killed him this leads to an all out comedy chase with violet steals the wrong corpse the next day to the ladies surprise hart shows up the ladies regroup in the restroom but roz overhears them and reports it to hart hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence the find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in hart 's absence hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and hart is not above taking someone else 's glory the subject matter here is very serious so to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly this is a film that many people identify with everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them and this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors you will laugh until it hurts dvd extras commentary by producer bruce gilbert and stars lily jane and dolly 9 to 5 25 a 25 minute featurette with interviews with gilbert writer director colin higgins and stars lily jane dolly and dabney coleman deleted scenes 10 mostly expanded scenes or alternate takes the problem is without some kind of commentary we do not know why the scene was cut
i wanted to do a grad school paper on something i was interested in researching and i picked after working for an underground magazine i 'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that i was too young to understand being born in i visited the university of in chicago interviewed underground artists and went to breaking shows in the illinois area although i thought i was very familiar with after working with this magazine i realized i knew nothing so when i was given the chance to do my research paper i knew that i would be able to learn even more than i already knew from working for the magazine i watched the three parts of beef '' first and saw an ad for this movie in the extras section honestly the first thing that caught my eye was how gorgeous wiggles was but then after fully watching the preview i realized this was the perfect movie for me to find out more about breaking this movie documented the founding members discussed the four elements of gave a lot of background information on kool herc and grandmaster flash talked about the different techniques in breaking the label breakdancing '' the media 's dilution of breaking the first movies that breaking was showcased in new breaking groups just a bunch of firsts '' it was a great reference for my paper i enjoyed watching it and i could watch it over and over again i have a lot of respect for the founders because without them headz would n't have this beautiful culture to express ourselves physically mentally and verbally
honestly i was n't certain about this film in fact at first i actually believed it was related to chocolate '' i was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised upon first viewing i did not laugh as much as the second time yes i tend to watch a film twice for i know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories i can be more relaxed and open minded the second time second viewing was a belly full of laughter this is the best lesbian comedy i have ever seen the acting was wonderful and the film was fast paced now that i decided that this film is exceptional it was time to put it to the test on others mostly women 20 's 80 's years some men each person i shared this film with either loaning it or viewing it together all responded similarly this is a hysterically funny film '' what is even more amazing is the brief allotted time the director accomplished in completing the filming process about days congratulations sometimes a tight budget can produce a true work of art many short films i have seen on the spiritual cinema circle '' also have numerous low budget wonderful productions hoorah for the film art genius i applaud the entire talented cast and crew especially actress christine cox her performance was exceptionally wonderful i would like to see her in more comedies she 's a natural i fell in love with her '' and i am straight gal as are all of the actresses except for frances a must see funny film i always wondered why the comedy male gay films always had that edge of humor when the lesbian films appeared more serious we need more films that are as pleasurable and diversified as better than chocolate '' thanks bunches
if you like action shooting explosions fire pain torture and revenge this is a movie you 'll love and it stars one of the best actors in the world who is completely believeable in this role a great storyline with intriguing twists plus situations and settings that are very close to reality
he kept it real thats all i can say aw yeah those people talkin bout its too much cussin what u expect im from the hood and every other word i say is a cuss word i just cant help it everybody in the hood cusses but
frankly the idea of a secret service agent having an affair with the president 's wife is way out there in the first place michael douglas not withstanding if you like keefer sutherland as in tv 's 24 you will probably like this movie his name could have been jack bower in this flick too i thought it had good action writing acting and directing i would not mind seeing keefer and michael teamed up again on the same side i bought the dvd but then again i collect movies for the actors
i saw this show on pbs and was so enthralled with it that i just had to order it the performances are priceless from folks who have passed on i do n't know of any other way to be able to see yul brynner 's commanding king and i performance loved it
i had been aware that once there was a show called show '' starring bob and david and that it had been on hbo but i had never been compelled to buy any of their dvds until this weekend when the power of satan um compelled me to pick up the first two seasons all i got ta say is praise satan for leading me to this glory ! the first season comprised of four episodes is fantastic with flashes of brilliance on the gay porno video '' but it 's the second season that really will make you a fan such oddities as woodycooks only the british can fly comedy writers the iguana and jeepers creepers unleash the funny like you 'd never believe show proves that there is a market for intelligent hilarious sketch comedy on cable or in the case of kith and monty python imported from other countries but show is homegrown it 's comedy at a breakneck speed and there 's never a dull moment in either season you 'll laugh you 'll cry you 'll learn how to fight crime with a crime stick '' and ice cream and enjoy products while your business goes to hell led by a red balloon the security guard and i shared something in common me !
this comedy volume is absolutely great while i 'm a fan of the series i thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next definately do n't watch season 3 before seeing these seasons because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree it does n't move as fast as some comedy out there but it all fits together better than most of what is on tv today
i have loved this movie ever since i saw it on television and watch it whenever it is on it 's been some time now and i plan to buy it waterston has never been better as the understanding and loving father i did n't realize when i first saw it that reese witherspoon was the daughter that was before reese witherspoon became reese witherspoon a heartbreaking beautifully acted and film rings true to life they certainly do n't make movies like this anymore and it 's a shame
some classic episodes indeed all in the family broke new ground in television sitcoms the world ws changing and liberalism was making its presence in many households archie bunker 's old fashioned values were being challenged it is certainly a bit scary how prejudiced archie bunker 's views were organizing petitions against minorities moving into his neigborhood not willing to donate blood for the fear it will save someone of a different race or religion quite a shock to the system especially when its seen today where society is very sensitive to what you can say because it might offend someone certainly a great show that makes you think about differing points of view and how we have evolved since the 1970 's carol o'connor jean stapelton sally struthers and rob reiner portray a slice of pie in ever changing times all in the family spawned off may other great shows such as the jeffersons maude and indirectly good times this first season was certainly a reverred one just look at it with an open mind
great movie great actors for such a sad part of the history ! it is great to see in this movie some men who really existed especially stonewall '' jackson we do n't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction but at the end of the day it 's not very important because the historical interest is preserved
jessica 's imagine the same film as the deep '' with jacqueline bisset a real sexy looking woman not a teenager chica lookalike '' with very poor seems the same director had a better choice in blue crush '' the rest is absolutly great and represents a great moment of adventures buy i
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation the cover appealled to me for these reasons and i admit i was not at all disappointed in the movie the scenery was indeed spectacular the underwater scenes were clear crisp and just what the doctor ordered even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful ok enough of the shallow stuff the movie was indeed much like the 70 's flick the deep '' which i enjoyed back then as well the characters of jared and sam were pretty believable poor honest and happy folks most of us would love to really be this happy let 's face it ! the introduction of bryce played by scott caan really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers twists etc overall the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives would i want to deal with tiger sharks no but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring job every day
see this it will shock you move you thrill you excite you chill you freak you out it 's one amazing strange movie it really takes a while to understand it at times but it has many valuable lessons one can learn witherspoons performance is shattering and remarkable among other things a great movie will be seen more times then i can count the next times i play it in my playe
i liked this work out it is very easy to follow the instructor who is very likable gives good instructions she gives each dance move a fun '' name so it is easy to remember i do this when i want to but do not have as much energy as usual or i will do it as a to another it always puts me in a good mood i liked that it contains a good warm up and an isolation section if you are looking for a dance fitness that leaves you grasping for air as you are drenched in sweat this is not for you if you are looking for a fun easy then this is for you
my 2 year old loves watching the dvd as well as listening to the cd in the car i have to admit that i have memorized all of the songs on the cd and the dances on the dvd too they are very catchy and i find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around ! the lyrics are really cute and the beats are great simple music but very creative i signed up for updates on laurie berkner 's website so i can find out she ever comes to town so my daughter and i of course can go see her she is a great alternative to barney and all of the other commercial characters who i do n't care much for i have bought this combo for all of my friends who have kids
good introduction to qigong mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful overall relaxing and precise
i loved the first and second season and was looking forward to season 3. where is it i hope that it is released soon it seems unfair to release two seasons and hold back on the ending ! a little unfair to the consumer do n't you think ! it is my understanding that 3 seasons is all there is is that correct
ohhhh ! i caught this movie on regular tv and even with commercials it was good i bought it so i would get the whole movie i have watched it a couple times myself and also a couple more times with friends or family a really amazing and edge of your seat movie and the ending will totally shock you !
this is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves the storyline is great but this should have been the last dvd things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over 20 that 's bogus dvds can fit way more episodes on a single disc and it 's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately the cowboy bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start then dropped down to 4. now it 's just getting worse at this point i 'm starting to regret buying the stand alone complex series instead of renting it i am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out though throughout the series i think disc 4 was my favorite
of course i enjoy this movie i ordered it after so many years of searching for it i love salsa music and the

a very successful comedy highly recommendable players are magnificent especially the final scene involving kevin cline 's dancing act is unforgettable enables people to overcome deeply rooted prejudices about sexual context fine trails in spectators ' brains
i quite enjoyed watching this film which is why i give it four stars even though i think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic so why did i like it joan cusack matt dillon kevin kline in that order and also a passably funny script at least one that is well structured for a viewing experience joan cusack is wonderful here her at her wayward fiance after he stands her up is fantastic and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street screaming is this the twilight zone '' at which point she collapses on the hood of matt dillon 's car in her wedding dress no less well that scene is adorable especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of shakespeare 's romeo and juliet a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity yes here is the heart of the film so i can not comprehend another viewer 's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film she 's obviously going to marry the movie star and get to eat cheetos into the bargain matt dillon is as ever the essence of cuteness and a much more desirable husband than kevin um i mean howard kevin kline does a decent job of mimicking howard a repressed gay man but it still feels like mimicking rather than acting here is also where the problems begin i guess wearing a means you are gay and similarly the barbra streisand gag is beaten to death and beyond how many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like barbra ! ! come on ! also kline 's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture not only is it not enough it 's really kind of humiliating nonetheless the final scene does give holland 's opus '' a run for its money and i ca n't deny it i did really have fun watching this movie it 's basically a sound little production well structured reasonably well written and kevin kline can dance
i 'm not big on anime but watching one episode got me hooked the voices the animation the story the characters and the music all blend so seamlessly that it is a joy to watch samurai champloo each and every episode just engrosses you deeper and deeper into the story line leaving you wanting for more
if you are bored with kurosawa 's faithful decpition of historical samurai and who would be if you think the samurai genre has been overused and outdated then get ready for the remix version of the age old genre samurai champloo directed by shinichiro watanabe the man who brought us cowboy bebop and 2 shorts in animatrix with character design by kazuto nakazawa kill bill vol 1 fame we are treated to a world that would have made the clan feel right at home the action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other one follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play the music is all modern no moody asian flare here the story is about the adventures of these two warriors as they escort a pessant girl across japan in search of a samurai who 's only distinquishing characteristic is that he smells like sunflowers '' lack of money food and patience is a recipe for disaster and wacky in this rated the equivilent of r in the us for bloody violence and language a must for any samurai genre fan
i loved this play tyler perry and his ability to make you laugh and cry is a blessing from god you can watch this with everyone in your family
the good earth '' must be considered a milestone movie '' as yet there is no dvd but one packed with about the making of this film would be especially welcome there was no oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939 otherwise the good earth '' would have 'taken home ' that award ! the lovely luise ranier did win best actress '' award the 1937 movie was based on pearl buck 's novel that won the pulitzer prize in 1932. interest in the good earth '' was revived in fall 2004 when it was selected for oprah 's book club '' perhaps women 's rights advocates should also give it a boost the story is about china in the a simple farmer wang lung is 'given ' by his father the slave for his bride i do not remember much from childhood about this film but i definitely do not recall paul muni having such a mouthful of teeth ! special effecrs ! luise ranier had won an oscar the previous year for her role in the ziegfield follies '' what a contrast ! here she is the completely docile loyal wife as someone wrote she was bound to her husband in eternal servitude '' and her devotion was betrayed partly through the machinations of uncle '' at every time of crisis in the story along comes groan ! the crafty manipulatve uncle walter connolly who whines wheedles inserting humor into the script and at the same time destroying family amity from the internet movie database are the prophetic words of former slave when i go back in that house it will be with my son in my arms i 'll have a red coat on him and red flower trousers and a hat with a gilded buddha and shoes and i 'll go into the kitchen where i spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe and i 'll show myself and my son to all of them '' smiles contented wang lung well now i i have n't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house '' is n't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago i found the quality of framed camera shots surprising the production of many scenes quite amazing read susan wong 's wonderfully perceptive review on today 's do n't seem to care about true life '' documentation in films but animation could n't convince as the locusts do ! that tired word awesome '' truly fits this vintage film the choking drought famine the beautiful 'condensed ' story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm and the terrifying scenes of revolutionary uprisings reviewer mchaiku hails this film and others that made an impact on my childhood !
i 've seen this movie on tv a few years ago but it just would n't leave my mind so i ordered the dvd it 's one of those movies you wo n't forget because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach ' as mitchell calls it morrie is a great coach and if you watch this movie you will see why it is so heartbreaking an old wise man a long lost friend who teaches the last course in his life at home one student a must have seen
what a cast ! mark wahlberg reese witherspoon william petersen amy brenneman and alyssa milano are all terrific in this taut thriller about an innocent girl witherspoon and her seemingly perfect boyfriend wahlberg of course the boyfriend is really a borderline psycho and a stalker wahlberg turns in a spectacular yet subtle performance william petersen csi is outstanding as the witherspoon 's concerned father who has way too many issues himself this film is a hidden gem buy it you will not be disappointed
otto preminger 's exodus is a very well made film this is a big film and director preminger is a master at handling films of this scale he is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature well that is preminger 's style straighforward and technically proficient movie making
i got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college good grief since when is a musical ever realistic especially one that is geared to kids hello ! ! it 's not supposed to be realistic ! if you expect realism go elsewhere but if you want to have some fun with a great message woven in then watch this movie kids love it mine do along with anyone else i 've talked to and the message is just terrific it 's okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes dislikes hobbies no matter what anyone else thinks i love it ! i ca n't even begin to say how much better this is than grease '' the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be happy '' relax with your kids go get some popcorn and have some fun with the wildcats kids from highschool musical
my children ages 6 and 11 absolutely love high school musical my son 's drama club is preparing to perform it this spring and he 's very excited about trying out for a part i enjoyed watching it as well the musical is set in a fairy tale high school but what musical is n't a fairy tale puppy love and teen rivalry all done in a disney way walt would have been proud
ouzon explores the feminine universe through the lives and times of 8 women around the sudden crime of the only man of the house 8 women every one of them with their affective lacks their tribulations little miseries sorrows and disillusions each one oft them is potentially suspicious of having murdered marcel the admirable photography and colossal arrangement of a beautiful stage with a sublime red carpet that remind us bergman in cries and whispers plus the visible and well deserved homage top alfred hitchcock vertigo expressed warmly in the last quarter of the film plus the additional musical numbers make of this film an absolute and delicious feast to your senses a !
this is as most critics agreed the best of the trilogy abrams ' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish including a few twists along the way i was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film the only thing i did n't like the short pause in the middle of the film probably for a change between the dual layers very annoying !
if you are interested in computer history and the fight between microsoft and apple still very hot today this is a must have dvd
there is not enough footage on the feud with macho man randy savage i prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story what did the macho man think about it unfortunately we can never get to hear from ms elizabeth would these be included in a future macho man dvd set i was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy especially in front of a huge live audience including kids i was totally shocked when i first saw that on tv back in the 80 's yes that 's hardcore deadly scary hardcore ! that should not happen in the first place the story involving steamboat is well covered it is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be it is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing there should be a line which should not be crossed how can a real heavyweight guitar be used by honky tonk to hit jake over the head human error hm nowadays tripe h is using a hammer to hit others on the head i guess a guitar is not a big deal by today 's standard enough is enough we do n't need accidents ! they may be an unevitable part of sports but not part of entertainment ''
i first saw this in the theatre because i like dennis quaid and scarlett johansson i had never really seen topher grace outside of 'that 70 's show ' which i never kept up with on a regular basis i fell in love the movie first time i saw it and bought it soon after it came out on dvd grace plays a 26 executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend he 's become such a machine in a competivie world that he 's loses his way in life i was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too one of mentor 's has told me repeatedly that the can be one of the roughest times in life so many things are going at once on so many levels to me this movie captured that paul weitz did a great job writing this the cast was exquisite
i 've been waiting for this to come out on dvd since i first saw it back in july i still ca n't understand why the critics just did n't get this one this has to be one of the best second films ever made in a trilogy the addition of davy jones was brilliant it made the film much darker and more dramatic johnny deep was superb as usual i still ca n't believe that the film made 400 million dollars domestically and over 1 billion dollars worldwide it 's surreal but everything about this movie was so on point that it 's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film i enjoyed this one more than the original i thought the story was more interesting on this occasion although you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of geoffrey rush 's character he and depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him it was a huge void to fill but enter bill nighy as davy jones and all is well i guess that 's one reason why dead man 's chest '' woks the way it does billy nighy gives an performance and when you add in orlando bloom and keira knightly it 's money in the bank the only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original star wars '' yes i prefer pirates '' over tlotr although perhaps my comments are premature since at world end '' has n't even been released yet should that be a dud then of course the whole thing falls apart but here 's hoping that the third time is a charmer if you own the first pirates '' on dvd then you have to get this do n't miss out
i 'd give 4 stars for this dvd release the movie itself has a special place for anyone who grew up watching soviet movies to relate the atmosphere of an old 60 's soviet eastern '' is not easy to an american viewer and i believe a better english dubbing could do this movie a better justice besides that it 's a must have particularly for any russian
one of john hughes best films ferris bueler made me laugh harder than any other hughes film the though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were love this film
i was amased at how very well acted directed and written this movie was the dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips everyone was well cast it is great movie for anyone and transcends the cliche it transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it 's a gay '' movie if you hated go fish '' like i did you 'll love this movie and go whew '' for this film it saves our lesbian cinema souls ! buy it ! you wo n't be sorr
leave it to the coen brothers to make werner heisenberg 's uncertainty principle the crux of a film noir and darned if they do n't make a good case for it in the man who was n't there '' typically they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who ca n't even remember heisenberg 's name nebbish barber ed crane billy bob thornton makes the only decisive and dishonest action of his life and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several mostly bystanders in the man who was n't there '' the phrase decisive action '' is an oxymoron everything crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance everything that happens from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face changes everything forever and always for the worse set in 1949 in santa rosa a tip of the hat to hitchcock and shadow of a doubt '' perhaps the man who was n't there '' looks perfect like every other coen film it 's a marvel of production design and the genius photographer roger deakins nails to a tree the dusty look of such classic noirs as double indemnity '' and out of the past '' thematically however the man who was n't there '' resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant much better acted remake of edgar ulmer 's detour '' in which the characters drift in a sartrean hell totally the victims of fate but whereas detour '' is more than the sum of its parts the man who was n't there '' is less the coen brothers may believe in chance but on the screen they leave nothing to chance so that everything in the man who was n't there '' is too perfect in the end the film has the same overstudied clinical quality that afflicts every coen film except fargo '' it must be admitted though that only one coen film '' the hudsucker proxy '' is ruined by that quality the acting is as superb as in any coen film thornton in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense hangdog gravity there are also glittering supporting performances by frances mcdormand as thornton 's philandering wife doris james gandolfini as her paramour and boss jon polito as a shady businessman michael badalucco as thornton 's motormouth scarlett johansson as the teenager thornton chastely fancies and especially tony shalhoub nearly stealing the picture as freddy riedenschneider defense attorney extraordinaire
i was not privy to the world of christopher guest until a friend of mine told me that if i liked dead gorgeous ' then i would flip over any of guest 's films the video store only had one in and that was in show ' and i 'm sooooo glad they had it this film has to be one of the funniest films i 've ever seen a complete riot from beginning to end as a true ' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to ' the mayflower dog show the film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy there 's jennifer coolidge and patrick crenshaw play leslie and sherri ann ward cabot total spoof on the whole anna nicole smith scandal owners of a prize winning poodle who 's won in show ' 2 years straight and with the help of lesbian handler christy cummings jane lynch hopefully she 'll win for a third then there 's harlan pepper christopher guest himself a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist and there 's power comic couple eugene levy and catherine o'hara who play the flecks owners of a terrier who struggle with flecks long line of previous lovers there are lovers stefan scott michael mckean john michael higgins who spoil their shih tzu 's and each other but finally we have the star couple of the show the neurotic meg and hamilton swan parker posey michael hitchcock owners of beatrice and beautiful yet disturbed and ' weimaraner who 's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex their antics arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film and their chemistry is pure brilliance the film brilliantly pokes fun at a sport taken way to serious and with fred willard as the commentator of the show the film is filled with barrel rolls from start to finish
a great look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us this with the more recent kennedy biographies for a wider sobering context this is the sort of thing that the bush administration should have watched before deciding to invade iraq
next friday was so much better than the first one with much more funnier scenes and this movie is reccommended for everyone
this is a sweet comedy with alot of formula but it works ! sometimes you have to fight for love and it takes something like a movie star moving in on the girl to push you to action predictable but funny is n't love worth fighting for
ferris bueller matthew broderick is a kind of hero to every aged young adult out there he 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be really he acts like he does n't have a care in the world and lives life to fullest the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye alan ruck a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris in this film ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another sick '' day for him his ninth to be exact in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process another antithesis of ferris is his sister jeannie jennifer grey who suspects something is up as does the dean of students ed rooney jeffrey jones it 's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen for instance ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days it 's amazing people like his parents who are most easily duped would think that this one sick kid when in reality he 's having a ball however knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile ferris and cameron bail out ferris ' girl sloane mia sara with a dead grandmother ploy and together the trio spend the day doing the town in chicago driving the gt convertible oh yeah ! this movie has a special message and feeling to it that 's as old as time it 's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life for after all as our hero says life moves pretty fast if you do n't stop to take a look every once in a while you might miss it '' that 's the moral of the story really bueller bueller bueller '' not here but he 'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day
highly enjoyable tale of the life of marty maher the irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become west point 's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years despite personal tragedies and through two world wars maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished army officers ' academy including future legends like omar bradley and dwight eisenhower tyrone power is excellent and compelling as he portrays maher from young idealist to elderly sage irish accent intact all the way the scenery and west point pageantry is fun to watch although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the military academy interestingly there 's not really all that much football in this film there 's a little but it 's mainly the story of maher and his family and the young men he came to love like his own sons with the maureen o'hara as maher 's irish wife mary giving a radiant performance sentimental in that way of course but the legendary director john ford working with a cast made up of many of his favorites always puts a bite behind the sweetness
when i read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts i thought yeah right '' but you really can pick and chose and combine what you want you can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio it is up to you or you can choose from the basic low medium or high intesity workouts this is a great workout dvd and denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part i 'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home
pbs did an outstanding job in putting this documentary together it covers his entire life and career and includes scenes from some of his lesser known and much more difficult to find films the documentary includes many interview pieces with kurosawa himself which gives you some added insight into what the man was really like also there are comments from noted japanese film historian donald richie as a kurosawa fan watching this on pbs when it aired the hour and forty five minutes seemed like about half an hour it is an excellent documentary about perhaps the greatest director of the twentieth century
this is a work of genius it is creative original funny and well done that being said it is probably not for everyone this wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from shakespeare 's hamlet these are the stars of the show in hamlet they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with hamlet 's melancholia they appear briefly and are gone the last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead they are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince in this work the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them the spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them as they discuss existential questions the tragedy of hamlet plays out around them it is quite funny but some background helps it helps a great deal if you are comfortable with elizabethan speech whole pieces are lifted from shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style it helps if you are familiar with hamlet that makes understanding the context easier it is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn it 's is fun
nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even william shatner would envy and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical as anybody who has seen this show knows the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for british comedy although as children '' of the three stooges americans are i think accustomed to somewhat comedy for those who do n't know this series it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids i would n't let mine watch with me until they are at least 20 by which time they will probably find this material boring if you are assembling a comedy collection however this series fills a unique niche my only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate it does n't even come in a box but rather in a little '' package which is neither aesthetic nor practical ca n't stack nor particularly protective it is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them i chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape works fine
i am a huge anime fan and this is by far the best lem me just say god i ca n't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is it inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy the whole series is actually based on a true story in japan a few hundred years ago the entire population of wolves in japan became extinct there are people there even today that report wolf sightings occasionally SMILE if you 're a fan of wolves or looking for something a little different check this dvd out ! the musics great the drawing is perfect not just a random bunch of stills like most animes but actual movement ! you get 4 episodes per dvd each is a little over 20 minutes long this dvd includes 19. a dream of an oasis this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep kiba finds a place where he is truly happy and wonders if he has finally found paradise 20. consciously this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series it has gorgeous music and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever just brilliant 21. battle 's red glare orcom 's men are fighting against an enemy and the wolves are caught in the middle we see a lot of blue in this episode she 's so cute as a puppy SMILE and cher 22. pieces of a shooting star the group decides to cross a sea of ice but it turns out not to be such a good idea toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff i ca n't say enough about this series unless you 've seen the whole thing you ca n't judge it it 's made by the same people as cowboy beebop '' and this dvd is preparing us for the typical bones conclusion SMILE the next dvd is way sad and very depressing no matter how tough you are you will be crying by the end
okay when i heard about the brat pack movie and music collection i was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of the high school reunion collection which was released several years ago both sets were released by universal fear not i am here to tell you about the differences the first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies like it 's closest cousin the high school reunion collection the brat pack movie and music collection includes the exact same '' the breakfast club '' sixteen candles '' and weird science '' the cover art on the dvd 's is the same no new bonus material with each film that i detected it has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off no one even really pegged this acting group the brat pack '' until around 1985. molly ringwald was one of the best known brat pack members and sixteen candles '' helped to start the whole brat pack phenom but no one ever considered weird science '' a brat pack movie trust me i remember the 80 's it always seemed like it would make more sense to include st elmo 's fire '' or pretty in pink '' in with this set this is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included the music cd includes the following '' true '' by spandau ballet tenderness '' by general public if you leave '' by omd weird science '' by oingo boingo oh yeah '' by yello which was in ferris bueller 's day off '' pretty in pink by the psychedelic furs do n't you forget about me '' by simple minds and i go crazy '' by flesh for lulu why include music from pretty in pink '' and not include the movie on to the packaging the packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning i own over 100 tv on dvd and box sets and nothing is like this the dvd 's are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the dvd 's are in sleeves instead of jewel cases on the back page of the binder is a pop quiz for the most part it is very similar to the highschool reunion collection but it 's nice to have the bonus cd and the cool packaging however it would have been nice if universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection one must assume they must not own the rights to pretty in pink '' it 's listed as a parmount dvd because that is easily one of the best known brat pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term brat pack associated with it
one of the many reasons we love movies is how they make us feel how they make us react dave '' a wonderful ivan reitman political confection is one of those rare movies we watch over and over again to get that warm fuzzy we all need from time to time kevin kline shines as the president 's sweet natured slightly goofy stand in after the the chief executive suffers a major stroke while boffing an aide the rest of the supporting cast also turn in exceptional performances as does the film score music which frames the film beautifully the relationships between dave and the first lady as well as dave and the head secret service man at the white house are especially touching i absolutely love this movie you will too
the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders the answer presented by material in the film is an unflinching no there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three the film 's strengths are that it does n't preach at least not in an overly wrought narrative and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims i can understand the pain and confusion of the victim 's families what is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them the victims ' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film at one point the mother of the byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone i hate them i hate them and the mother 's that bore them '' is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child no quite natural really but the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started i imagine the bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in i 'll have to ask brad pitt what he thinks about it some time on the issue of the prosecution they had next to nothing a very questionable confession from a terrified kid jessie with a 72 iq hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard damien bragging about the murder but have no proof a knife found behind damien 's house which does n't match the wounds on the bodies and the assertion that because damien read about wicca he must be a satanist to look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film jessie a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world his iq is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low iq damien is the key to everything in this film though the defense made the key mistake of letting damien take the stand for two reasons the first reason is that damien appears to have add and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no 's the second reason and the most important is that damien is obviously extremely bright normally this would n't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world damien scared them all of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other more sinister and shocking suspects that needed to be pursued the war rages on for the west memphis three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it and terrifying to think they didn't
if you judge this movie using the same checklist you would for a beautiful mind '' or even lord of the rings '' you 've missed the boat this movie is a bit more foolish than the others and that is what 's so great about it see this movie through the eyes of a child and allow it to make you laugh to gross you out to surprise you with its clever twists of plot to amaze you with heroes that defy all odds and to capture your imagination with peculiar pirates ' treasures
all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie this is a very well made movie with perfectly competent performances the tone is quite serious and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up but then there are many people who loved titanic which i found utterly depressing more to the point though who cares about the problems of these rich kids not me the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful and if you enjoy this film check out less than zero another gloomy but solid underrated film the worst film is bright lights big city do n't say i did n't warn you !
i fell in love with this movie me and my husband and that is funny because usually we do n't have the same taste in movie
this is a wonderful movie to keep the kids and quite possibly yourself entertained during an holiday i laughed i cried really i did and i just really enjoyed it
i 'll admit that i 'm a to the madea '' series finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece creator tyler perry and his the opinionated never lit by the way madea '' have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans mostly nationwide though the stories feature the characters the belligerent teenager the devoted wife the straying husband the vixens the lotharios etc and situations infidelity promiscuity straying from the church comedic funerals obnoxious and overbearing family members perry 's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story 's ending dependent upon divine intervention making things right some of the acting performances are a little over the top and the musical selections though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists are weak in the lyrics department however as a whole the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by hollywood and is having great success on both the stage and screen this compilation lets the viewer experience revisit those stage shows
inliked the film in the theater and i like the film now the plot does not drag and does not bore
i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way the direction was fine the actors well chosen the script very good and harrison ford 's acting top quality i think this film was superior to older ones like the hunt for red october '' or crimson tide '' whose story was rather flat and predictable the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew 's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian
kids will be kids ! within being a kid is the freedom to be intuitive honorable and brave these raw qualities displayed so well by the young man in the movie allows even adults to spring to the occasion of the pure gut feeling of love '' risk becomes only the next step susan sarondon is superb in her charactor of strength courage wit and willingness to go up against the big tough bad guys with all the money and power tommy lee jones is convincing as he portrays one of the money and power fools
this is an excellent movie if you like war flicks it made me angry being from the vietnam generation also it shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men the acting from all the cast was top class i highly recommend this movie it may be slow at first but the action later is amazing
richard dryfuss and holly hunter are fabulous in this wonderful remake of a guy named joe '' full of great flying laughs with john goodman and a special appearance of audrey hepburn in her last film you 'll love it
as you can tell from my other reviews i own a lot of kathy smith dvd 's the reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great and instruction she always cues from your point of view when she says left it 's your left which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen this step workout has 3 segments designed for beginner intermediate and advanced the beginner should stop after segment 1 and go to the cooldown the intermediate stepper should finish segments 1 and 2 and then proceed to the cooldown the advanced stepper can do all 3 segments before cooling down each segment gives you two options high impact power moves or low impact higher impact consists of modifying low impact moves to contain more jumps one person in each segment does the low impact moves so you can follow her segment 1 12 minutes long easy to follow basic stepping kathy and company use a springboard step but any step or even no step for beginners will work just fine segment 2 13 minutes long slightly more intense than segment 1 and more add on sequences after you 've been stepping 6 minutes kathy moves to squats and lunges which gives you a rest and lets your heartrate lower this is my only complaint about this video i wish she would have added this at the end of the entire video and continued cardio through the entire segement however this segment only lasts minutes so it 's not that big of a deal there is a heart rate check after this segment segment 3 12 minutes the step is switched to the other position for a bit more variety a few squats and leg lifts in sequence finish out this segment there is a 5 minute cooldown and a little bit of a stretch probably wo n't be adequate for most people after this workout she has a safety demonstration after the cooldown where she promotes the step she shows in the video but should be viewed by first time steppers to make sure they do it properly
i 'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand you receive one of the greatest mgm musicals ever conceived and it 's bolstered by quite nice extras that much you can be assured of i 'm writing this particular review because of warner insistance on using fragile cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases the problem with these warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case rendering it 's capability the actually hold the disc useless and unlike the plastic cases the warner ones can not be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer good luck with that by the way another problem lies with the fact that it 's made out of cardboard when you remove the stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover this can occur even when you 're carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off the reason i feel the need to mention this is i own dozens of warner movies and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one not likely greedy to be fair warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases the film noir and gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases but titles like kiss me kate '' rebel without a cause '' broadway melody of 1940 '' and even wizard of oz '' are still only available in these sad cardboard cases
i loved this play it provided drama suspense comedy inspiration and great music tyler perry has done it again sit back relax and enjoy the message
i just watched this movie last night i came across the title on someone 's myspace and being a jared leto fan i wanted to watch it i had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting riveting is the very least i can say about this film it is as the amazon editorial review puts it a tour through hell '' this film makes you think the fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but i keep wondering is it so far fetched how many people are there that actually do escape addictions you might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another during the film i kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground some little piece of hope left i was wrong the film did n't depict drug use the way that i had expected to see it the way i had seen it depicted in countless other films all of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure personally i found it painful to watch there were moments when i actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch i think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film the truth is that i could n't stop watching the film put me directly in the shoes of the addict i felt like the addicts in the film my hands sweaty and my heart pounding i could n't close my eyes i want to see it again sometime i would like to watch it with my husband i bought the movie before i had ever watched it the first time the film was painfully realistic genuinely graphic appalling and appealing at the same exact time a must see overall i think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection personally it is probably one of the best movies i have ever watched i think the acting in the movie was outstanding the direction was genius and the plot was amazingly horrific all in all this is an 5 star film
a deeply emotional film about addiction love and family just to some but when you watch this film you take something with you something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted life each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending really depressing movie but worth a look at least once marlon wayans and jennifer connelly were extremely good but ellen burstyn broke my heart her performance rocked
i teared up when i heard the music from the theme song to the electric company for the first time in 30 years i grew up with this show and now my children are learning from it too thanks to whoever arranged to have it released on dvd it was and still is a great show
i agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say baby einstein videos however i still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay my two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although i agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland i love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the dvd my son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days the video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing
according to imdb moulin rouge '' was shot in 1.37 not widescreen therefore you 're not losing that much to view this in 1.33 full screen format
i really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work i 'm a photographer but not this line of work it was an interesting glimpse into their lives i wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it
one of the most beautiful and sympathetic movies ever made about wolves alaska and the inuit i could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it a analyst who just happens to be in the right place at the right time he has his doubts early on is chosen to go north to investigate the arctic wolf and its impact on the caribou population along the way he encounters a host of intriguing characters including a entrepreneurial bush pilot looking to make some sort of big score a number of wacky bit players who i can easily imagine were not actors but the real deal and every bit as eccentric as they appeared and an endearingly sage old inuit of few words but many eloquent silences the investigator tyler is not at all sure that he 's up to the demands of the job but forges ahead regardless played with practical flair by charles martin smith a perfect choice for the lead here i would be at a loss and if left alone on a frozen lake in alaska as his character tyler is tyler takes it all in stride trusting it will all be good in the morning even though it is established early that for all the fact that he was chosen for this mission he goes into it with a terror of wolves after the assistance of the old inuit man in getting centered on his path and the abrupt disappearance of his benefactor who has a way of coming and going that magicians would envy tyler finds himself deep in the bush country and immersed in the world of wolves before he realizes how completely they have taken him over knowledge and observance quickly negates his fear and he is brought to a serenity of spirit and understanding of his place in the world that makes me wish i had the courage and stamina to go out and try it too a caveat there is a culinary moment in this movie that might cause the squeamish some distress do what i did at the crucial moment look at the ceiling or recite to yourself it 's only chocolate it 's only chocolate '' you 'll know when it gets close they do n't spring it on you and it is just chocolate highly recommended for the whole family oh one more caveat if adults offend you briefly and not flagrantly overt then maybe this is n't your movie
about a young scientist played by charles martin smith who goes to the arctic to study wolves their survival and their effect on the caribou herds he proves they are not killing the caribou as it had been assumed he is a fledgling in the wilds but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves he notices the wolves eating mice and begins to do the same himself a supreme irony in this disney film the first half is excellent compelling and beautiful to watch but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a bad guy message and a confusing indian mysticism presentation it 's wonderfully photographed though and the soundtrack is stunning
who could ever forget the image of manuel fidello spencer tracy turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle infectious portuguese accent yo ho little fish do n't cry do n't cry '' if you 're a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from spencer tracy 's signature movie courageous ' released in plot harvey freddie bartholomew an rich kid falls overboard off a luxury vessel and finds himself adrift until a passing merchant fishing ship pulls him out of the sea he is taken under the tutorage of his rescuer a friendly portuguese fisherman named manuel harvey is initially hostile to the thought of having to obey orders and work for his room and board until the ship returns to dock but eventually comes to understand the important lessons in life being imparted by manuel before his adventure at sea is over he 'll learn what it means to be a man this is without a doubt my favorite spencer tracy film and a story the entire family will enjoy it 's beautifully filmed with a tremendous cast which includes along with spencer tracy and freddie bartholomew the legendary lionel barrymore as disko and john carradine as long jack
after spinal tap this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown but like st it is right on these wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it 's satire it 's real if you hate even the idea of folk music skip it or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people if you were there i was it 's a real hoot enanny ! sadly here in california they were to be found en masse at every local 99 cents only stores i realize this is not for everyone but neither was spinal tap give it a try
when you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the 's generation you 're talking about paddy chayefsky 's brilliantly written black comedy hospital ' which was released in a contemporary dysfunctional urban hospital serves as the microcosm of america 's failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century but the mental and emotional illnesses as well george scott stars in the role of herbert bock hospital administrator bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity his wife has left him he 's estranged from his children and he 's in the grips of a crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question when a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad with great performances by george scott and the lovely brit diana rigg hospital ' is a film that will elicit discussion and debate watch it with a friend
it 's a more vulnerable patton in a white coat running a hospital and it 's all great fun with a good story from an script you have to love it when scott dresses down a bureaucratic nurse in that gravelly bellow you him to finish her off with there are brave men dying out there ! ''
my favorite dvds are concerts festivals unplugged etc i was going to buy the cd and amazon pointed me to their dvd i prefer dvd surround sound to cd stereo plus you get something to look at i heard the demon days songs on the radio and liked them alot this is an excellent dvd you may want to check out bonnaroo cross roads string cheese even the doobie oh yeah and eric burdon and the new animals
season 5 is one of the best of all ! archie and mike are still doing what they do best about anything and everything the best part of the whole season is when archie finds out that the meathead has bought the jedderson 's old house next door arch 's expression is priceless ! ! ! i'f you buy this set u wo n't be sorr
most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is i am a long time fan and had seen rattle and hum but did n't get around to purchasing the dvd until late 2005. the fact that the music is wonderful is a given but the cinematography is just astounding i love how you get to see everything from every point of view you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage including the breathtaking sea of fans you get to see what the fans see the spectacular lighting and silhouettes you get to hear what the guys think and feel as well as on and of course you get the passionate music the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to i could n't ask for more
it is a wonderful complement to my lucy collection the tango scene is some of her best physical comedy ! !
the story of a young award winner of a filmmaker 's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get his '' first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by christopher spinal tap guest it 's a cynical and hysterical look at how hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis unlike many of favorable reviewers i 'm not a fan of christopher guest 's later works and that 's not just because i 'm envious of him being married to jamie leigh curtis lucky dog i do n't find guffman or best of show more than mildly amusing at best save for bob balaban in guffman when sparky comes back i almost bust a gut sometimes artists do their best work up front i like woody allen 's first three pictures the best what 's up tiger lily take the money and run bananas i think this is the case here guest hit gold great script terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast a near genius i 'm gon na steal one of the other reviewer 's word here because it 's so perfect kudos and thanks turn '' by jt walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history alas another great '' dying so soon before his time like warren oates and robert shaw fabulous work by martin short teri hatcher j t walsh jennifer jason leigh fran drescher dan schneider jason gould wakter olkewicz and seriously i could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines there are tons of people in this sublime comedy its only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene that comes off as way too cloying other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of hollywood someone said comparing this to the player was like comparing bagger vance to caddyshack i 'm not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be caddyshack is a classic and so the big picture i am a big big fan of altman and the big picture is even par with the player if either were more biting i would give the nod to the big picture though richard e grant 's performance is almost as good as walsh 's nick 's kevin bacon flights of fancy are hysterical this is an inspired and unfortunately comedy
first of all i have lost count of the ammount of times i have seen this movie but every time i watch it i get goose bumps this is how affective the movie is george scott of patton '' fame plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and scott begins to investige the house 's history this is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film this movie is all about atmosphere there are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays this film does not need to gross the viewer out the changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters you are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease there is nothing in your face '' about the scares this film is for fans of the 1960 's film the haunting '' or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story do n't even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and i guarantee you 'll watch it more than once i have recommended it to many people and i never heard a negative comment for the full effect wait until night to watch it and then watch it alone see how many times you glance over your shoulder
one of the productions of which he is the most proud robert redford 's all the president 's men should be required viewing and the book should be required reading for all who aspire to the profession of journalist redford was fascinated with the story of two young untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the watergate until it led to the highest office in the united states redford 's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary so he followed as the story developed he got to know bob woodward and carl bernstein when they were still at ground level still unsure as to where this would all lead but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics redford has always been a political animal with a reporter 's instinct and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the american political climate earlier he and director michael ritchie had made the candidate a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most of men or women and a film well worth your time it took two years of hard work to get all the president 's men off the ground it was turned down by several studios with the excuse that people were tired of watergate but he was finally able to get warner to say yes provided redford himself would star dustin hoffman was enlisted to play carl bernstein redford 's old friend jason robards won an oscar as washington post ben bradlee jack warden was cast as editor harry rosenfeld martin balsam was editor howard simons jane alexander was judy hoback bookkeeper to the committee to the president ned beatty was martin dardis who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence stephen collins was hugh sloan whose wife debbie played by meredith baxter kept his conscience working on the right side robert walden who would go on the the fine television series lou grant was dirty trickster donald segretti and hal holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story the mysterious deep throat who helped woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall of course we now know that deep throat was the fbi 's assistant director mark felt an old friend of woodward 's and a man torn between his loyalty to the fbi and the need to shed light on some very dirty redford asked alan pakula to direct and gordon willis to handle the cinematography and they crafted a look that is part documentary part thriller if you get a chance also see pakula and willis ' the parallax view starring warren beatty another outstanding scary political film william goldman who won an oscar for butch cassidy and the sundance kid wrote the tight exciting screenplay for which he won again this was actually the fourth time redford and goldman had worked together goldman also adapted donald westlake 's the hot rock a very funny caper film and the poignant the great waldo pepper which was out for a short time on dvd in pan and scan but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful widescreen splendor universal where are you the efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes all the president 's men a smashing success it succeeds as an exciting suspenseful procedural as a statement on the neccessity of a free press as a character study and as a great the dvd set is the one to buy the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp clean aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by redford himself the second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film on woodward and bernstein and on deep throat there is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film and an interview with jason robards on the dinah shore show a deserved landmark in film and in journalism all the president 's men is a and for all who aspire to what journalism should be a in our darkest hour when all seems obfuscated and hopeless it reminds us that light can be brought to bear people can make a difference
peter palmer and leslie parrish are excellent in this fun politically skewering musical comedy the songs are upbeat fun especially put em back '' sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates
lil abner is a delightful with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals this film version of the broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on dvd in a beautiful print with it 's comic book coloring it 's also superbly cast the film 's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play lil abner and daisy mae peter palmer who starred in the broadway show and leslie parrish but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles it 's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as abner anyway although daisy mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era it 's a shame neither palmer or parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals as the dogpatch crowd might say it 's true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable notably jublian cornpone '' a typical day in dogpatch '' and put 'em back the way they was '' which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young valerie harper rhoda '' and beth howland alice '' but most of the songs are and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original broadway show jerry lewis has a funny cameo and the gorgeous julie newmar and stella stevens have amusing secondary roles most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here including donna douglas as the busty hillbilly girl a few years before becoming famous as one on the beverly hillbillies who wants to broaden our horizons '' and is informed by mammy yokum superbly played by billie hayes that she her horizons is broaden enough there 's quite a bit of political satire in here as well with politicans with such apt names as mayor dogmeat and senator jack phigbound and the sadie hawkins day sequence a dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it 's own with many high schools for years having an annual sadie hawkins dance '' in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered acceptable '' is a lot of fun but then so is the movie as a yoakam says when they really mean it i has spoken ! ''
i saw this movie before i read the books the books are much funnier and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film still i liked the film and especially baby sunny i thought jim carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions as always brought the character to life i think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film the essence of the story was captured and is entertaining but i do recommend reading the series before or after watching the film
haunted castle '' and alien adventure '' are great but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of encounter in the third dimension '' makes it better than the other two the film is an excellent way of showing how started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in other than the entire movie itself i do wish the mine ride was longer though the one which ends with the big round stone ball slamming into the tunnel and there was more shown of the experience sure the jules verne journey to the center of the earth '' ride certainly makes up for it but the effects in the shorter example were awesome like the bats best of all the film does n't look all that dated cgi wise for a 1998 production now i 've definitely got to get the sequel misadventures in '' dvd noticed something stupid in the credits for encounter '' instead of saying cassandra peterson as elvira mistress of the dark '' it redundantly reads elvira as elvira mistress of the dark '' unlike the other imax films this one is good either in stereo depth form or wise of course the best is since that is the whole point of the story anyway i highly recommend this movie to all collectors
that this film is dedicated to the memory of david maysles should tell you all you need to know about what 's in store along with his brother albert david maysles created some of the most groundbreaking and fascinating documentaries of the 60 's and 70 's gim me shelter '' salesman '' grey gardens '' and joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky did a fabulous job here of carrying on the stylistic tradition the story of the poor and ward brothers is touching and engrossing despite the squalor in which they lived and this early 90 's legal case is a significant study in cultural assumptions and regional justice absorbing and worth owning this anniversary edition packs on a host of extras but just an fyi the product detail '' here on amazon that suggests that this 'stars ' connie chung is wildly inaccurate she did a piece on the ward brothers which we see them watching on a tv for a couple of minutes and that 's all she never physically appears in this film
lets face it woodey allen has produced so much a few of his things sort of slip past some of us i have found this one did for many people it 's the kind of movie you watch more then once you have to wonder did the actors fill in some of those lines 'improv ' or were those allens
love this dvd so much ! the actors are super and the story is hilarious ! if you liked the first one get this one
i was not in a rush to get this almost forgot i ordered it so it was a delight when it arrived thank you very much for a smooth and speedy transaction
the first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation it 's hard to even describe really but expect some disoriented backgrounds with some cgi thrown in the plot however is excellent the main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories he constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers they do what is called committing '' someone for their sins these first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great this anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there
this volume gets right to the heart of the plot and raises important questions who really is gohda where is the next refugee threat coming from who tried to kill the prime minster and what roll does he play in the individual eleven is there a terrorist virus causing another stand alone complex can togusa finds his way clear of criminal charges also we all know the major but what of her past disc 4 episodes in dolby digital 5.1 surround sound english and japanese episodes 1. ambivalence 2. trial 3. affection 4. selecon upcoming releases ghost in the shell sac official log 1 scheduled release date ghost in the shell sac gig vol 3 scheduled release date note if you see any anime items for sale that seem to cheap they are bootlegs do not buy !
lady and the trap has been an enduring disney classic for 50 years now and it 's amazing how well it holds up after all that time the hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch this film is an example of disney animation at its classic best but calling lady and the tramp a great animated film is really selling it short it 's a great movie period lady 's idyllic life is shattered and bad boy tramp comes to her rescue while he begins his relationship with lady in the dog house sorry could n't resist he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end if you 've seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you 'll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans watch lady and the tramp and you 'll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years
i have been a casual fan of the radio version of prairie home companion '' for decades although i seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time usually only if i am driving somewhere on a saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast i read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it and while most critics kind of liked it there were a few grumbles however i thought the film was excellent and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans i liked all the casting too robert altman is not a favorite director but when he is good he is very good as in and nashville '' when he is bad he is terrible but here i thought he done good same with garrison i trashed his recent novel in an amazon review but i liked him in this
this is the best film i 've seen in perhaps six months or more the direction by director ferzan ozpetek is consistently interesting intriguing beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually the film is beautifully cut and the acting particularly by the fascinating giovanna mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also giovanna is first rate the story begins in a bakery during world war ii when davide veroli massimo girotti is a baker 's apprentice we see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the establishment but he is pounced upon by the baker they wrestle a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on davide 's hands as he runs out into the streets cut to modern times as giovanna and her husband filippo filippo nigro are crossing a bridge in the city they meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented he ca n't remember his name and he has no identification filippo takes pity on him and against his wife 's wishes takes him home with them to their apartment we know because of the man 's age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from world war ii but his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about giovanna 's brief affair with the man next door lorenzo raoul bova whose apartment window faces hers this is a love story a one which all great love stories should be in some sense since life itself is bittersweet it is framed by and contrasted with another love story that involving the older man from many years ago the tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man because the police can find out nothing about the old man and because giovanna 's heart softens toward him and because he is an elegant man of refinement especially in the pastry arts giovanna 's dream is to be a pastry chef the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship the old man and the young woman that 's enough of the plot the development the denouement and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense instead let me say that the feel of modern italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present the dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films this is the first film directed by ozpetek that i have seen but it wo n't be the last but see this for giovanna mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen
this film is a real delight but it also has a message about our consumer culture do n't miss the deleted scenes i 'm sorry the director cut out the saints in the loft '' in particular what a powerful image ! but it 's there on the dvd so enjoy this marvelous charmer of a film
this is a very good well made dvd which is fulled of idea to prepare dinner for your family
i bought this at yep you guessed it the grocery store which was a very clever marketing concept on martha 's part there was only one dvd left it contained classic recipes for chicken beef fish vegetarian and other main dishes if you think you already know how to make classic everyday dishes such as meatloaf think again because martha 's variations may put a whole new twist on your usual standards her use of fresh herbs truly does make a difference and the glaze on her meatloaf was one i had n't tried before my family loved it there is also a section with bloopers yes martha 's mistakes or mishaps while filming a scene slips falls etc there are 12 different cupcake variations and an extra section on kitchen tips i learned plenty of new things from this section i have to admit that i looked at the bloopers section first intrigued by the idea of actually seeing martha make and i only wish there were more of those they were funny especially the one showing martha pulling an carrot from her garden you 'll have to buy the dvd to see the rest it is a very short section however then i watched the dvd from start to finish and marveled at the quality of the production as well as how much information was packed into this dvd from start to finish each recipe was demonstrated clearly i intend to use this one with my youngest child because it is a perfect introduction to some classic recipes from roast chicken to meatloaf they may not be made the way you are used to making them but in one case that was an advantage the meatloaf recipe was far better than my standard version and the glaze was delicious do be aware of your oven 's peculiarities however and cover the top to keep the glaze from burning uncover just long enough to brown it would be best of course to use an oven thermometer and know your oven 's actual temperature since 350 in one oven may not be 350 in another those dials may be inaccurate but do n't make the mistake of thinking this is only for beginning cooks although it 'd be a perfect housewarming gift for the college graduate who is just setting up house there are plenty of new recipes especially a squash casserole which i am dying to try on my vegetarian friends after having tested it on my family and getting rave reviews in fact one of the nicest sections of this dvd was the vegetarian one each of those recipes looked delicious martha 's mother is featured in some of the segments and that was a pleasant surprise she and martha chat as they cook and the whole atmosphere is nice and casual no matter what you may think of martha stewart this dvd is a quality production with tons of useful info the dvd can also be inserted in a computer to get a list of menus and other features
often overlooked robert altman 's 'the long goodbye ' is arguably one of the films exemplifying the and although far less dark ranks alongside antonioni 's 'the passenger ' propelling marlowe into the opulent 'promise ' of the west coast usa altman allows the story to unfold around a classic murder mystery story and the stunning cast help to create an atmosphere of parochial ' that can subsequently be seen in the works of david lynch tarrantino and more recently the 'sopranos ' the late great sterling hayden gives an unforgetable bullying volatile king performance as the ageing impotent alcoholic writer and mark rydell 's 'dangerous ' violent character anticipates that which martin scorsese and joe pesci create latterly in moreover there 's an uncredited cameo appearance of a moustachioed arnold schwarzenneger as a 'heavy ' however its elliiot 's gould 's brilliant oscar deserving performance as philip marlowe that helps to seal this film 's status into the canon of great films gould creates a sharp amiable detective whose ' livestyle allow him the freedom to give his own chandleresque dialogue 'it 's alright by me ' whilst interacting with a diverse range of characters within the narrative with respect to this there 's the continual variation of the haunting melody 'the long goodbye ' that is throughout the film thus floating the narrative structure within changing and moving events and themes yet anchoring it to the overall thread of the story itself altman 's direction is that of a genius at work the of the oceanic tug and wash of the tide as seen through the windows of the seductive though manipulative eilleen wade 's windows nina van pallandt together with slightly surreal and erotic appartment setting of marlowe 's flat make this film unforgetable there 's also the tension associated with the 'journeys ' to mexico a theme used in more recent great films including 'lone star ' 'traffic ' and 'the three burials of melquiades estrada ' who can deny the impact of the opening 'cat ' scene and the final 'chapter ' of the film set within the avenue of trees the ' figure of eileen wade heading in the opposite direction to marlowe who ironically celebrates his parochial sense of closure by playing the minature harmonica if ever a film rated as a ' for special merit and sheer enjoyment then this is one of the elite few deserving of such an award ! i urge you to watch or this film and savour a work of pure genius as a commentator and fan of such a seminal film i can only hope that robert altman elliot gould can provide a criterion edition dvd
i could watch this over and over again ! it 's so funny ! the person who dissed women 's manly handshakes is a sexist ! but anyway i would seriously recommend buying this if you want something funny to watch ! definitely 5 stars and your kids would probably like it too one viewing per 5 months do n't force it on them is my advice ! ! rock o

what 's so 'ugly ' about this movie because it depicts the truth to all you parents out there this is exactly what teenagers do on a daily basis i know because i was once a teenager too and this movie hits the mark this is what happens when parent 's do n't have a solid relationship with their kids this movie is not ugly its just the straight up truth which most people do n't like to recognize it 's up to us as parents to guide our children in the right direction so this type of behavior can be minimized
i loved gone with the wind this movie lets the lovers of gone with the wind know what happens it is a great ending but set your mind and be aware that the rhett leaves something to be desired and scarlett too but it is a good movie and i love knowing the ending
this is the sort of sequel that should have been made in the first place the premise is sillier than the first film which was pretty silly itself but the characters are appealing and the action is streamlined and intense enjoy the ride and try to forget that the lost world '' ever existed
my girlfriend told me about this movie up until then i have never heard about it this movie was alot better then i thought it would be i enjoyed every minute of it it kept me on my toes the entire time
when i sat down to watch a movie called three woman with the knowledge that one of the three woman is shelley duvall my first reaction was that i would be better off drinking a nice tall glass of toilet water but that reaction was short lived it is rare for me to enjoy a movie that i was determined to hate from the first second but this movie forced me to pull a 180. the ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go it is a trance like movie i found that i could n't stop from watching yet i didnt know why i was watching very bizzare and very mezmerizing not a movie that will be enjoyed over and over however
was meticulously planned out by our government if people do not believe me go read and study that day like it was your babay and you 'll find the truth i was a bit skeptical at first as well now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in this is n't the united states of america this is the beginning of a new world order do n't believe me we 'll probably never know because we 'll be spoonfed our news on the war in iraq by the corporate media that controls and censors what we see and do n't see ! do n't think so you along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in iraq by watching cnn censored news network or fauxnews it pains me that people still do n't realize that there is no fight for democracy in iraq its a fight for imperial ambitions we need iraq for oil and to set up a puppet government so it does n't scare israel our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of radical muslim fundamentalists '' no one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself instead of relying on experts '' who know '' what is going on i thought we were intelligent people us americans most of you ca n't even figure out wat the problem really is its our corrupt government
i am a big fan of the book and thought the film version did it justice beautifully filmed excellent performances
i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times due to my obsession and after watching it more than 25 times i 've come to appreciate it more great cast sam neil is my favorite richard attenborough is a little too cute and nice but i liked his white clothing the hat and the amber cane wayne knight was incredible as nedry the slob he 's as likeable as ever though somewhat the villain i always hate it when he dies jeff goldblum fit the description of ian malcom from crichton 's novel well crichton sparked my interest in chaos theory sometimes called the butterfly effect i am a firm believer in it and of course in the novel and film malcolm was right life finds a way '' in chaos theory the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions and random '' unpredictable events result from the normal '' because there is never a fixed set of outcomes the system is unpredictable because of its complexity hammond thought his system was without error that he was in complete control he believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female but he was wrong the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian dna that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur dna this dna gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce survive '' in a environment and it turned out that hammond was wrong about many other equations things are not as black and white as he thought and it is problematic to predict behavior of his animals love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet we watched the dna segment in a high school biology class i 've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated though i found hammond 's live speaking lines to be unrealistic was he really planning to be there for each tour the kids were kind of annoying i did n't notice this until i was a little older but lex i prefer to be called a hacker '' uses silicon graphics ' file system navigator to turn power back on in the park their logo is on the monitor if only unix were as popular as windows is now anyway the soundtrack was classic it was the first cd i bought back in the tonya harding skated to the theme at the 1994 olympics or some other competition i only liked her because of her excellent music choice
greetings '' is an offbeat satire from a very young brian de palma starring an equally young robert de niro the vignettes focus on three friends first there is jon rubin de niro an aspiring filmmaker who has the idea of creating peep art '' this would consist of filming private moments '' and then letting people view them through tiny windows thereby the peeping tom experience more of this in de palma 's much better 1970 film hi mom ! '' however if you are expecting to see an amazing performance by one of the great actors of his generation in an early film you are going to be disappointed de niro comes off as overly mannered and a bit forced in his performance especially in comparison to his two his best moment is as he talks a woman through going to bed for his peep art she repeatedly forgets not to talk but he is a lot better two years later and had a decent career at least until he started making credit card commercials first there is lloyd clay gerrit graham a conspiracy nut so obsessed with the jfk assassination that a woman sleeping in his bed is just another opportunity to show that the paths indicated by the bullet holes do not match up unless jfk was shot while standing on his head lloyd shares his deep dark thoughts directly with the viewing audience as he argues vigorously to convince us he is right but sometimes he finds people in the real world to assault with his from the zapruder film that reduce the assassination to a rorschach test finally we have paul gerald shaw jonathan warden who would like to find the right girl his problem is that he has his induction physical and going to vietnam will really hurt his love life fortunately lloyd and jon are fully of ideas as to how paul can get the army to reject him everything from pretending to be gay and coming on to the sergeant lloyd 's idea to volunteering to shoot not only the vietcong but also any american troops of color jon 's brainstorm there is no real narrative thread here which is hardly a criticism because greetings '' is more of an ancestor of the groove tube '' saturday night live '' and second city tv '' in the history of contemporary sketch comedy with a heavy satirical bent the difference is that what de palma and his friends come up with in greetings '' is more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy but there is something compelling about its enthusiasm which makes us forgive the filmmaker and his actors when things go on a bit too long de palma has admitted to being influenced by godard and the french nouvelle vague '' cinema which inspired going out on the street and trying to improvise scenes only they did not have enough film to improvise so they ended up rehearsing most of the film to save money but even in this early work de palma is clearly into doing everything you can do with a movie camera greetings '' is a historical footnote in cinematic history inasmuch as it was the first film in the to be given an x '' rating later changed to r '' which is what it would qualify today because of some of the shots of nude women in terms of social history greetings '' represents some of the politics of the late it had been almost thirty years since i first saw greetings '' and hi mom ! '' back then they constituted part of my first real exposure to radical thought in terms of what was out there on the streets if you see just one of these films interested in how de palma was cutting his teeth as a director before he made his name with carrie '' and dressed to kill '' then hi mom ! '' is the choice the black in black baby '' bit is the must see segment of that satire but if you are interested in de palma 's career or comedy from the late then check them both out
this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny but it did n't detract from the film glad i bought it
this is a great family movie a fresh take on enchantment stories it 's rather in the style of nesbit 's books using contemporary references i find it far superior to many of disney 's usual works it 's enjoyable for adults and kids

the series was always delightful because it was fun done with panache and done with a little tongue in cheek pierce brosnan was great and stephanie zimbalist was a wonderful partner loved 'em both nice to be able to see it again because i enjoyed it so much and because there is nothing on tv like it today
once again the saga of motoko kusanagi refuses to fall into the popular mold as manga as a pair of feature films and now a tv series it combines the classic crowd pleasers of the science fiction of a not too distant time a topnotch group of secret agents and a beautiful woman with a story line that is n't fraid to stop and contemplate the complicated world where the line between mechanical and human program and soul get crossed every day what you will see for most of these last few episodes is the dismantling of section 9 when their efforts to get to the bottom of the secretary general 's plot result in danger to the nations politicians this invites retaliation and everyone goes undercover and eventually fall into the governments hands all the laughing man 's efforts seem to come to naught and theire is every sign that this series is about to have a very nourish ending well all i 'll tell you is that the ending is worth all the trauma of getting there these three episodes really focus on the characters of the section 9 team in unexpected fashion and even the tachikoma 's make a reappearance this has been a contemplative series first the ethical questions raised by the laughing man and human cyberization then the even more difficult issues of what life is or can be in these episodes kusanagi reveals a personal philosophy which is both chilling and evocative of the samurai code she is a modern tomoe gozen unendingly loyal to arimaki and fiercely defiant in battle this has been a series with considerable depth that echoes but never slavishly imitates the work that has gone before a fine piece of work from both an artistic and an entertainment point of view
i like pretty much all of annie leibovitz 's photography and if you have noticed her work on magazine stands you 'll probably enjoy the book too
its original idea challenges us to look in a new way at the things we do n't have the answers for kevin costner is joe darrow an emergency doctor who 's pregnant wife emily also a doctor dies in a tragic accident in venezuela while he 's in chicago and trying desperately to reunite with her joe does n't find her body and this leaves him haunted his emotional pain is beyond belief he buries himself in work one day he remembers that emily asked him to check on her paediatric cancer patients and he starts visiting them then unusual things begin to happen the children who have had experience have seen emily and are trying to pass a message joe darrow 's already shattered world is now turned completely upside down he is forced to change his beliefs this is dramatic and painful process and its end is a triumph of one of the greatest love stories ever told ! kevin costner 's performance as joe darrow is absolutely brilliant his extraordinary talent shines in this complex and emotionally demanding role ! dragonfly is a profound film its magnificent end is affirmation of life and a great inspiration after all '' it 's belief that gets us there ''
ok sue me i love this piece of cheese from the 70 's a remake of sorts of the last man on earth heston is a doctor who used a expermental sereum on himself after a bio war has wiped out most of the world the people who are left are albinos who ca n't get out in the sun vampires as they were in the book and they want heston to die for his crimes he is free of the germ and was an army doctor so they blame him for the end of the world heston spends his days tracking them and killing them and his nights whole up fighting off the mutants this was a staple of late night and for some reason the sunday afternoon movie you can tell in the stunts that it 's not heston and some of the speachs are well corny but the movie even with it 's down beat story is fun and can be scary for younger kids still i would be very careful about letting young ones see it as it has some nude scenes in it the widescreen transfer is very good as is the sound and the extras are small but very nice
sunset boulevard is a drama that reveals the unsightly world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense joe gillis william holden a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on sunset boulevard while walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool he is shocked to discover it 's occupied by old star norma desmond gloria swanson living with a devoted chauffeur estranged from hollywood and forgotten by fans in desmond 's mind she is still a star working on her next big roll in a script she has been scribbling for years knowing the script does n't have a chance as a writer joe looks at this as an opportunity to fine tune '' it to earn some extra cash however the working relationship is not all that tidy it seems lonely desmond is looking to sponsor a gigolo his payment is a warm place to stay at night a closet full of clothes nice meals private parties '' and desmond 's company if it were possible for desmond 's to be supplanted by anything it would be the possessiveness for joe 's affection young joe needs a break from such austere surroundings and eventually goes out to a party with real people and meets a girl engaged to an old friend through a series of secret rendezvous they begin to collaborate on a script with real potential and naturally develop feelings for one another the girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on sunset boulevard is a formidable challenge with some of the most memorable quotes in hollywod this is a wonderfully produced '' drama by billy wilder that well projects the intense emotions not only of each character but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are all about eve an imitation of life and what ever happened to baby jane a gem on the dvd extras is the history of fashion legend edith head movie quote there 's nothing tragic about being fifty not unless you 're trying to be
this movie is possibly one of the best movies i have ever seen christopher nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies this movie is very unique and will never get old
i grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local target craving the summer sun and needing an island vacation the cover appealled to me for these reasons and i admit i was not at all disappointed in the movie the scenery was indeed spectacular the underwater scenes were clear crisp and just what the doctor ordered even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful ok enough of the shallow stuff the movie was indeed much like the 70 's flick the deep '' which i enjoyed back then as well the characters of jared and sam were pretty believable poor honest and happy folks most of us would love to really be this happy let 's face it ! the introduction of bryce played by scott caan really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers twists etc overall the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives would i want to deal with tiger sharks no but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring job every day
this film is the best film that disney has in it 's collection ! every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life i really like all the extras on the disc as well i like seeing how the film was created looking at deleted scenes learning about the history of real pirates and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of walt disney himself
update jan 27 2006 i am still waiting for this placed last october i have repeatedly asked the company to delete items listed on its website that it does not have i am glad that amazon has finally removed its original listing of this new from its website jan 27 2006 i am still waiting for this to be delivered for initially the thanksgiving holiday followed by as promised by representatives of amazon christmas i doubt if amazon actually has this item for new year 's day 2006 forget to mention that i ordered it on oct 27 2005 and today is dec 26 2005. i received another update this morning indicating that the item will not be shipped until jan 27 2006. i am going to keep waiting until somebody admits that amazon does not have this item at all
in a nutshell underrated undervalued underexposed excellent submarine thriller with the added attraction of having been based on a true historic event ! it is hard to believe how poorly this excellent film did at the harrison ford and liam neeson are ideally suited as soviet naval captains and as believable as their rebuilt authentic ! kathryn bigelow who directed and produced the film did an incredible job which can be better appreciated by viewing the 3 excellent featurettes that are included on the dvd bottom line this new kind of sub film is a part of history if you enjoy submarine films this is one of the best if you enjoy thrillers this film delivers enough tension and authentic submarine situations to satisfy both the and in anyone
i 've seen the pilates infomercials for a while now but have been intimidated by the seemingly impossible movements when i found this inexpensive for dummies '' dvd i decided to give it a try what a workout ! i consider myself to be in moderately good shape and this workout can definitely be felt ! within the first couple of days i immediately noticed a change in my posture and a good burn in my abs hips and thighs i highly recommend this as both a great workout and a wonderful intro to pilates
ok even for a guy i thought the hype might be a little more than it was worth but to my amazement i thought is was a great story and lived up to all that i have reviewed i would suggest the movie to all
newman redford robert shaw as the bad guy twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so how can anyone not like the sting '' when i saw it on the big screen upon its first release i did not think it deserved the oscar as best film of its year although i enjoyed it now decades later and after having seen it perhaps 20 times at least in pieces i think it one of the best achievements in in its century it has style and a consistent sensibility and logic and on first viewing it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top i ca n't imagine that anyone over 30 has n't seen it yet but if that 's you fix it as soon as possible it is a primer in how to write direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience newman 's drunken on the train with shaw is absolutely classic
hector elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill aside from his superlative work as a doctor on chicago hope '' he has been often cast as a sideman in films the trusted aide the sympathetic boss but often in supporting roles in tortilla soup '' he takes the leading role in a remake of ang lee 's eat drink man woman '' he plays martin naranjo a mexican chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist the movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared then eaten that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen martin is has lost much of his sense of taste which he thinks is a cruel irony but his cuban partner reminds him that beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago elizabeth pena is leticia the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple grace '' into jacqueline obradors is the saucy carmen who was encouraged to get her mba by martin but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion as her father did with his wondrous cooking tamara mello is the youngest maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to find herself '' constance marie is family friend yolando who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who martin dotes on raquel welch is yolando 's mother hortensia who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished martin the film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions at the beginning of the film all of the characters are single by the end they 've all been paired off in one manner or another some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others raquel welch is a bit of a distraction in the film at age 61 she has a beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25. in a film full of attractive performers she does n't look her age '' enough to blend into the story she plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester the movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and i would recommend it if only to watch hector elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen
it is the ultima of cgi video game movies i must buy for final fantasy addicts
if you love john waters then you 're already right there with me i would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie grease but is a more film i love rooting for the drapes and the idea that the squares can become drapes which thematically seems to be a waterian theme that we can all get along if we have sex with each other which is probably true john oh yeah and johnny depp is young here and cool and i think you will enjoy seeing both ricki lake and tracy lords and willem dafoe as well i know i did
although subtitled grazia 's island grazia is the lead role magnificently realized by valeria golino respiro '' could have well been called scenes from rural sicilian life '' as the scenography cinematography and imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line respiro 's locale is lampedusa a tiny island far off the west coast of sicily about the same latitude as malta this place is about as remote as it gets tunisia is closer than palermo it can be safe to say that italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades this is italy of de sica and mascagni not fellini and prada the men go out to sea the children play women pack fish old crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky throughout this film you would probably ask yourself is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited '' it 's a fairly typical story the type that a few great and many many average italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations life in the sun drenched rural ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds how long since cinema paradiso '' what i like most about the movie besides the appealing scenery was the interrelations of the characters the humor petty gossips the impromptu emotional outbursts the displays of maternal and filial affection the two boys are tremendous the older pasquale francesco casisa is the more mature of the two the younger filippo filippo pucillo has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings often without sense his rant against the busybody women is a treasure as is his protectiveness of his sister from the the boy embodies an epic italianate inflammability far beyond his years while viewing this i thought the son 's affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times they do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village after seeing this film i have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar the differences are in the languages but the feelings are same i enjoyed this film so much i might see it a couple of times
respiro is one of those italian treasures of a film this time written and directed by the insightful emanuele crialese that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story respiro mixes the italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by fellini lampedusa is a mediterranean island between sicily and tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of italy to be a return to the native the population is all involved in fishing on this picturesque island lives grazia the beautiful and talented valeria golina who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality she lives happily with her fisherman husband pietro and her children teenage marinella veronica d'agostini pasquale frncesco casisa a very fine little actor ! and filippo filippo pucillo the boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother 's wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace when grazia 's actions come under scrutiny by pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother muzzi loffredo who occasionally gives grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests grazia needs psychiatric help in milan grazia runs away to hide in a grotto her whereabouts are known only to pasquale the little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of grazia only to discover on st bartolo 's day that grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean how this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of respiro suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away ! this little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean of any film you 'll see the music by john surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric the way director crialese captures the behavior of the youngsters ' games and the philosophy of the villagers is utterly magical this is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society respiro is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to eden in italian with english subtitles grady harp november 200
i enjoy all three of the the jurassic park movies though i think the lost world '' is a bit weak while i think that anyone who enjoys action movies monster movies or horror movies should own all three i find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set that contains not only the three movies but a fourth dvd containing substantial background information on the making of the movies i give this collection four stars only because the larger more comprehensive collection is available and if you liked the first two you will definitely like the third movie
now it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004. a relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them bob roberts a son of a hippy couple rebels against that world view and uses music as a means of spreading conservative propaganda marketing hate and intolerance in the flag this movie frighteningly shows in fiction what is being done in reality today i think bob roberts will be a movie that historians will study 200 years ago and see it relevant for discussion of the united states around the turn of the millenium
if you are not familiar with research this nice approach to a scientist 's work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies besides this very interesting and moving film with high level and homogeneous performances will show the closest it can the early facts about such a terrible disease i strongly recommend it i have seen it with my 16 year old son but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age a bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience
i 'll make this short and sweet i used to work in spin i did advance which is creating media events for politicians in other words for a time i was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information i 'll let others speak to the eerie connections to orwell 's foresight i 'll let others write about how effectively the film makers make the case that which is represented in this piece is true the observations are astute the prognosis is grim i wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who clings to the belief in the ideas of the founding fathers buy it watch it watch it again share it with friends
watch this and be inspired by the awesome herbie hancock the recording sessions are great the music and the movie flow along like a terrific jazz solo riffing on all kinds of themes but herbie brings it together into a whole just watching him play on the piano is a treat if you 're not that familiar with this living jazz legend check this out and you 'll admire both the man and his music
your milage may vary but i found this movie intense and extremely provocative there is little danger of giving away the plot it is not particularly complex three stupid arrogant american teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from finland to the former ussr which at the time was very much the ussr and a very bad place for americans they make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate so far so good but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the russians who mistake them for spies some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving that i 'll keep a secret for ya i can promise you one thing if you are american after seeing this you 'll salute the flag think real hard before traveling overseas and i 'll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border
bruce almighty is a great movie it about a newsreporter bruce nolan jim carrey that has a bad day a work gets fired and thinks that god is punishing him so god morgan freedman meets him at a warehouse and tell bruce that he can have all his powers then bruce has fun with the god powers gets his job back but sometimes its hard to be god you 'll have to watch the rest of the movie to find the rest out SMILE their are some great parts in the movie like when he gets a monkey to crawl out of a guys butt when he gets prayers it saids you got prayers '' instead of you got mail '' overall the story was pretty good and funny if you want to have some good laughs and giggles watch this and some scenes are not appropriate with children hehe though it is rating
here is the reason why somebody like bruce can not be a god simply because the world would suck ! ! ! and his life too it 's a very good movie it shows that people ca n't always have what they want very interesting and unpredictable plot hilarious
excellent great camera work very good sound and commentar
the direction of this film is excellent i love all the characters and the way they interact the storyline is very important also it 's about religious beliefs and neighbors that interact with each other it 's a and interesting story that 's not like anything else i 've ever seen
this 2 disc set is packaged in a very nicely made large metal box with room for the other volumes in the series if you feel the need to remove them from the original cardboard packaging you 'll lose your otaku status if you do the box is well adorned with imagery from the series and is a very good idea and generous from bandai considering that we 'd have bought a normal cardboard box with joy thanks bandai appreciated
in some of fred astaire 's movies there 's only one excellent reason to watch and that 's to watch fred astaire in you were never lovelier there are three other excellent reasons rita hayworth jerome kern johnny mercer the four of them have concocted a romantic and funny south american fable that features some great dancing by both astaire and hayworth and some memorable songs by kern and mercer eduardo acuna adolphe menjou a wealthy buenos aires businessman has four beautiful daughters and in the acuna family they must marry in age order the eldest fulfills her responsibilities and the two youngest have beaus they 're now anxious to share vows with but the second eldest maria rita hayworth is in no hurry she wants romance and charm and the men she meets are just panting boys then she sees robert davis fred astaire a very charming dancer singing dearly beloved at her elder sister 's wedding he tries to chat her up she stares him down then the plot intervenes before long she knows what she wants robert knows what he wants eduardo acuna knows what he does n't want a dancer in the family from then on it 's songs dances romance and misunderstandings which moves into songs dances and romance the plot feels sluggish at times and there 's way too much xavier cugat and his orchestra but astaire and hayworth are at their peak kern has written some memorable melodies and few could top mercer at lyric writing none in hollywood hayworth not only was a gorgeous creature she was a gifted dancer many think she was the best astaire worked with technically she not only handled the steps astaire created she did so without a hint of effort after you 've watched the dances a couple of times go back and watch again but this time concentrate on her face and her hand and arm action she gives every indication of being utterly relaxed and enjoying herself even in the fast tap routines she seems naturally to find the most graceful attitude for an extended arm a turn of her head a raised hand she may not be quite as good as astaire but she 's good enough among the routines are the audition dance robert shows up at acuna 's office and demands a chance to show his stuff as a dancer from there astaire takes off on a fast tap routine that takes him all over the floor onto acuna 's desk the sofa and chairs he works into the dance a cane a rug the drapes and acuna 's head i 'm old fashioned this is probably the best romantic wooing dance astaire did it 's all fluid motion and spontaneous recognition danced on the elegant polished outdoor landing of acuna 's mansion rita hayworth is a vision and matches him step for step we move from maria declaring with humor and assurance that robert 's the man for her to robert 's protestation that he 's just a guy from omaha nebraska to the dance that brings them closer and closer together until we know through the dance that a love match has just happened the funny exit through the doors and back into the bumping into each other each giving way bumping again and then going in together arm in arm hits just the right note the dance works so well in part because kern and mercer came up with a classic i 'm old fashioned i love the moonlight i love the old fashioned things the sound of rain upon a window pane the starry song that april sings this year 's fancies are passing fancies but sighing sighs holding hands these my heart understands i 'm old fashioned but i do n't mind it that 's how i want to be as long as you agree to stay old fashioned with me the shorty george this fast tap routine starts out with maria visiting robert at a rehearsal he sings the shorty george and she takes a couple of lines he looks surprised that she knows the song he starts to dance and invites her to join him hayworth stays right with astaire and looks like she 's having the time of her life you were never lovelier robert declares his feelings for maria but more misunderstandings occur finally everything is resolved robert shakes off some knight 's armor he was wearing there is sort of a reason and appears below maria 's bedroom window in black tie she rushes down and off they go dancing while all the members of the acuna family look on approvingly and the johnny mercer lyrics and jerome kern music brings us to the happy end you were never lovelier you were never so fair dreams were never lovelier pardon me if i stare down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face i can only say they chose the proper place you were never lovelier and to coin a new phrase i was never luckier in my palmiest days make a note and you can quote me honor bright you were never lovelier than you are tonight
city by the sea is a movie that is propelled by its rich performances particularly those of robert deniro and frances mcdormand both oscar winners they infuse their characters with such humanity and imperfection they make this movie much better than it would have been in other hands james franco although obviously in '' to his performance comes across attempting to repeat his emmy award winning role as james dean the mannerisms the false bravado the hurt and pinched face are trademarks of the late dean and franco seems to enjoy using them again william forsythe approaches a caricature of his role but it 's still spinetingling enough to make your skin crawl anson mount as the moralistic cop dave simond gives a strong understated performance showing that all cops are n't bad george dzundza as deniro 's partner is also good as is linda emon as his wife in a very touching and sad scene where deniro confronts her after dzunda 's death at the hands of deniro 's son the movie is to be commended for giving us characters with flaws and in understanding the way some relationships never fully materialize or heal the film has some marvelous cinematography of the old asbury park area and has an ending that while not totally satisfying is real a good movie
rather than menace to society '' this movie should be titled the unfortunate victims of a racist society '' my heart bleeds for the counterparts of these young men caught up in the unending battle for survival in la and other such areas all around the country i understand that we all make choices but how many do these young men have it is a racist exclusionary society that has condemned them to their fate to die violently at the hands of their own brothers its sickening society is more of a menace to these young men than they are responsible for being a menace to society having said that the movie itself is excellent it 's gritty and real to the 'nth ' degree movies like this should be a huge wakeup call for the 'powers that be ' in this country but the reality is that the grave lessons it teaches will pass unnoticed
i wanted to see a movie one evening and it really did n't matter what movie i just wanted to get out of the house and get to a theater i looked at the listings and decided to see in good company '' and i 'm certainly glad i did i found this movie to be very entertaining and very enjoyable to watch i thought this movie really showed a new edge to scarlett johansson as well in a way this movie was also an on todays ' corporate america and its ' all too often pitfalls nicely produced acted and directed
eddie dies and goes to heaven where he learns his life has been meaningful to at least 5 people i enjoyed watching this movie and i feel it allows us to appreciate the little things done for others not making us feel guilty because we did not change the world with a bang
this is one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it when it first came out and ten years later it 's still just as funny basic plot ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he 's alone on new year 's night anyone who 's had a bad on the job can relate to ted as he encounters the most 'unusual ' situations from the witches who need his 'secret ' ingredient to make their potion to a gangster 's bratty kids a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken hollywood people who want to make ted part of their hazardous and very gross bet i do n't want to give too much away but i will say that i will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever if you love a good dark comedy this is the movie for you
this set is one of the better jurassic park sets each disk contains a lot of extras many of which are fun to watch fans of the trilogy that have yet to buy the dvds will find this set a great one to have jurassic park '' introduced us to digital dinosaurs and how fearsome they could be with modern computer technology this movie advanced horror and monster movies in a method similar to the way alien '' advanced science fiction movies jurassic park '' immediately became an audience favorite and the new standard by which special effects would be judged stephen spielberg effectively combined terror with special effects to keep people at the edge of their seats and in awe of creatures dinosaurs the lost world '' unfortunately did not measure up to jurassic park '' many of the characters were unbelievable and there were too many plot holes that were too readily visible to make the movie enjoyable from beginning to end while there were several parts of the movie that were there were at least as many parts where the actions of the characters were unrealistic the bumps in the actions of the characters just did not allow me to focus on the plot throughout another problem with this movie is that it focused too much on action and very little on the characters themselves thus the movie comes across as more of a cartoon than a horror movie jurassic park iii '' simplified the plot added new dinosaurs and allowed the characters to develop more than the lost world '' the short length of the movie forced the movie to be simpler than the previous movie and that simplicity makes for a good movie the best new dinosaur in this movie had to be the pteranodons though the spinosaur was great also the characters in this movie generally acted as i would expect them to and there were fewer outright acts of stupidity even the theft of a raptor egg was done in ignorance so while it was a convenient plot device you would expect something like that by someone with only minimal knowledge of dinosaurs i was very happy to see sam neill returning in the role of alan grant his character particularly is very believable enjoy !
i loved ben vereen in the show wanted the music for my ipod too very satisfie
this show undoubtly is one of the greatest around i have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give american 's their own monty python show and they failed because their show is better than monty python their show is not better it is of equal and noteworthy standing monty python is history that will never been changed they have gone on to do many other creative things bob odenkirk is doing miller lite commercials and i hope he does something like david has with his new appearance in arrested development i can honestly say that this show is not better yet it is close to monty pythons flying circus both are great shows it is full of hillarious sketches and original ideas that is for sure and if you have n't yet go buy the other seasons and add to your growing comedy sets because you wo n't regret adding this
hospitals are inherently spooky scenes of so much pain and death the very walls soaking up the agony through the years they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there the hospital in infection '' kansen '' is in particularly bad shape losing money unable to keep staff the doctors and nurses working there are and desperate into this unstable environment comes a strange patient with a black infectious rash slowly the rash spreads revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human 's body slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation but all is not as it seems even then i 'm impressed that even watching as much as i do infection '' still managed to creep me out it was unexpectedly good director masayuki ochiai knows the things in a hospital that can make you cringe and he uses them to their fullest extent he also keeps you guessing as to exactly what kind of horror movie this is is it about a devastating biological infection are those ghosts is that a serial killer all of his images and slow revelations of the story keep making less and less sense disorientating you just when you think you have a handle on it until the final page is revealed and it all comes crashing home infection '' is n't quite a flick like ichi the killer '' but it definitely relies on visual shock for its scares while keeping a good atmosphere if anything it manages to combine the creepy mood of ghost films like ring '' while still delivering on gore one scene in particular had me going when you see the movie you will know what it was as part of the theater '' series and directer by a relatively who 's experience has mainly been doing horror tv shows i did n't have high expectations for this film i thought it would be a cheap job done to cash in on the current fad i was wrong it is quite a well made little horror flick not outstanding or groundbreaking but really excellent for what it is
i find the breakdown of each step concise and easy to follow the instructions also contain tips for safety which is an assurance for beginners like me would be sharing this with my pals and recommending it to whoever wants to lear
at ikiru 's opening i started to have real doubts about the film i had heard that this was kurosawa 's best and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down luckily that did n't happen the narrator of the film reminded me of criswell 's narrations to plan 9 from outer space the film seemed to say too much and show too little then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero watanabe at work something clicked the long duration of the shot and the narrator 's continued breakdown of the man 's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds and that we are powerless to silence it that floored me and for the rest of the film i remained by this humble yet miserable man takashi shimura gives one of the greatest performances i 've seen since raging bull here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world but he 's smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt the horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time there are points at which the film seems to drag on but never without purpose when he dies having finally given meaning to his existence his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity confusion and finally admiration the scene lags which makes us that much more insulted by their ignorance
this is a great film that preceded the onset of the jlo '' out of sight '' is a great showcase for jennifer lopez 's talent as an actress it is a shame that she has n't been presented with more great roles like that of karen sisco in this film karen is a who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude she has a chance encounter with charming compulsive bank robber jack foley george clooney their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his kidnapping of sisco in her own car it is no surprise that sparks fly this does n't downplay the complexities of their encounter some of the greatest strong points of this film include the juxtaposition of flashbacks incorporating trick camera work and voice overs what 's more this film was shot in a very bare bones style we do n't get a sense of romance so much as a feeling of stark reality the colors are dark the dialogue between the characters is honest real and simply wonderful this film has a potential for mass appeal due to the fact that though it does get gritty and violent that does n't downplay its intelligence or originality violence is counterbalanced by genuinely funny scenes as well as more introspective glimpses at how the characters turned out as they did this is definitely a great date film ! !
this was one of the best movies of 1998 but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience when i try to think of superlatives to desribe it the one that keeps coming to mind is cool '' most of the coolness factor is owed to two things steven soderbergh 's steady directing and the chemistry between the actors especially george clooney and jennifer lopez back before we knew that clooney would go on to channel the same character in virtually all of his roles he defined suave in this movie and back before she was lopez was that in living color fly girl with the big ole butt trying to make a name for herself as a film actress here she gives the best performance of her career while all of the cast ving rhames dennis farina albert brooks and michael keaton and samuel jackson in cameos is solid after clooney and lopez the real star is don cheadle he is quite convincing as the prison boxer snoopy he oozes rage and steals every scene that he 's in plots based on books by elmore leonard tend to be above average but are mostly dependent upon the colorful characters he writes thanks to the talent of all involved this movie is one of the best
i did n't think it would be that great and only saw it for joshua jackson but the plot twists were really good and i enjoyed it a lot and of course kate hudson whom i adore even though i did n't pay much attention to her in this one but yeah i really liked the end and this is where i first heard of norman reedus then i saw the boondock saints SMILE this is a good movie and is very underappreciated

this dvd has wonderful workouts i think the flexibility of 10 min workouts to target certain areas is a fabulous idea it keeps me motivated to keep going the dvd does n't work as it should you should be able to pick 3 different workouts and it will play the ones you 've picked in order this does n't work so i just pick the ones i want to do one at a time and then i 'm able to workout the areas i want
i have a few friends who do n't like cartoons '' i guess they were brought up on drek and it turned them off of the whole genre when i run into this attitude i pull out spirited away and my neighbor totoroto show them the beauty subtly and power of animation
i first watched this performance on pbs great performances it is amazing i 'm very happy to finally find a complete version of the stage show on dvd rachel york does a performance in the leading role the rest of the cast is up to par there have been other reviews that say the music is dated or other such nonsense but do not pay heed to them premiered in 1948 the musical is based on the taming of the shrew shakespeare and the music and lyrics are done by cole porter sometimes referred to as his masterpiece which i agree with the production never drags or disappoints the lyrics are extremely witty a trademark of porter the music keeps you humming along for days
this show is great the season was considered by critics but it is truely halarious see 'the ski lift ' for a classic curb episode
happiness can be delicate in just one swoop it can stolen out from under you just when you least expect it the results can be often devastating some can never recover the family in the italian film the son 's room has found such happiness but when tragedy suddenly strikes they 're engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache grief is perhaps the most tangled of human emotions and the vagaries of sadness love and anger that comprise its essence are often very difficult to portray luckily director and actor nanni moretti avoids all the usual clichs in this delicately nuanced and subtly acted film the son 's room is indeed a moving and weighty depiction of one family 's attempts to heal after sudden death strikes them moretti stars as giovanni a successful psychiatrist with a busy practice treating the assorted neurotics of the northern italian coastal town he and his family call home giovanni is a and kindly man who has a sort of passive and submissive approach to living giovanni also has a lovely family he 's happily married to gorgeous book publisher paola laura morante and shares what he considers a close relationship with his teenaged daughter irene jasmine trinca and son andrea giuseppe sanfelice he presides over his wife and two children with a kind of flaccid authority enveloping them with the same deceptively passive doctoral concern with which he counsels his psychiatric patients he supports and heals less by what he says than by what he does n't say he quietly coaches andrea in soccer moves while encouraging irene to be more competitive at basketball perhaps it 's an ominous portent of what is to come but the film opens as andrea and his friends have been accused of stealing a valuable fossil from the school 's science department giovanni and paola are surprised to find they entertaining the idea that their son may in fact be guilty as charged however no one takes the incident that seriously if this is the only drama that affects giovanni 's serene life nothing prepares him for the sudden tragedy that occurs one sunny sunday afternoon called away from home by a desperate client giovanni cancels his plans to go jogging with andrea and it 's a fatal choice that haunts him for months to come the accident when it happens is so unexpected the loss giving rise to sorrow rage tenderness and the inexplicable feeling that hope is no longer possible the family emotionally fractured is unable to continue on plunged into unimaginable grief giovanni attempts to carry on with his life but bereft of his objectivity he finds he 's no longer able to function as an analyst the son 's room with it 's subtle acting and its pensive emotionally layered story remains a startling testament to the delicate nuances of grief and it 's as though moretti has invited the viewer to spy on a deeply personal event in the life of a very ordinary family like a fly on the wall we witness the sadness the regret the empty dinners and the overwhelming feeling of whether they could have done anything to stop the accident moretti whose eyes glitter with knowledge from within a bland bearded professorial face gives a wonderful performance as does the classy morente as the beautiful anguished paola while giovanni wanders dazed through a theme park numb to the grief paola fields a desire to talk about the absent child a savior for the family arrives in a letter addressed to the deceased and when the writer appears on the family 's doorstep she offers the grace note that reminds them of the means by which happiness eventually repairs itself and the unavoidable fact that life goes on there 's no catharsis here only a heartfelt exploration of what it means to grieve mike leonard august 05
this series is awesome and i am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over it speaks to the depths of the soul of a man having experienced intense pain though not in war i find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series this bonding is what men were meant to do not just in war but in our every day battles the sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional i recommend this for any group of buddies or even church groups
very good acting and a fantastic script put this movie at the top of the list of must see movies of this decade you have to decide for yourself about the spiritual quality and message but i personally thought it was well done joaquin phoenix puts in his usual top notch performance
not only does the movie signs offer a wonderfully different kind of tale but its characters are very likable and the story is about much more than aliens from another planet the story 's true question is this does everything just happen by chance or is god caring for his children in ways they simply can not understand signs is the story of hope lost faith put aside because of intense pain and grief and how one man 's relationship with god affects the lives of those around him we were amazed by how truly moving this film is as well as how humorous it can be and we were impressed with the acting of all the cast does everything just happen by chance or is god caring for his children in ways they simply can not understand
this movie is obviously not for everyone it 's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour 's nope instead you get the muscle huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in this film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart soul and body of every other thing in existence in an world this film is a big orgy of questioning and who does n't like questioning this film in its own right is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films huckabees '' offers us an impressive cast with dustin hoffman lily tomlin jason schwartzman jude law mark wahlberg isabelle huppert one of my favorite international actress 's and naomi watts most notable performances by namely dustin hoffman as it 's nice to see him in an exceptional role he has n't really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997 's wag the dog '' it 's very nice to see hoffman play a great character as bernard the quirky husband half of the existential detectives also most notable is the performance of mark wahlberg as tommy corn another client of the detectives that befriends albert tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather rides a bike to the fire saying we 'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum '' mark wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably boogie nights '' and three kings '' however this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else the ensemble 's performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless the most credit to this movie goes to david russell russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story but the story is amazingly written the script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that
she just keeps getting better and better i love this woman she makes us all look at ourselves and laugh over situations that are hurtful i personally will keep an open mind and try to copy some of her down to earth common sense a lot uf us have let go of for whatever reason way to go
one thing about arrested development that i forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years what i found funny last year when i was watching the show is just as consistently funny now in fact now that i understand the style of humor better i think the show is even funnier now fox had something good cooking with arrested development it seems whenever a show does n't get the ratings a network wants a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings it very rarely works and sadly arrested development is another example of this i ca n't blame fox for pulling the plug after all they tried their hardest to promote the show i remember sunday nights watching the simpsons and during the commercials the people at fox really wanted viewers to tune in the writers of the show should be proud that fox tried very hard to keep it on the air it 's just unfortunate people did n't want to watch it i still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy arrested development would be around today as it stands 53 episodes are all we have of this great show honestly it 's not enough but will have to do do we really need anymore laugh track comedies are n't there more than enough of them on the air now most of these shows people wo n't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there 's so many most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same and they blend together one plainly obvious joke after another i 'm bored just thinking about it we 've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to arrested development is the right move in my opinion the times need to change people make a big deal about arrested development because there 's really nothing else like it on television that 's why the show deserves all the ratings it has received here on amazon people would n't be praising the show so much if there was n't a good reason for it trust me there 's a reason for all the positive reviews buy one of the dvd season sets pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave watch the show and experience the joy so many people are raving about
this is a great dvd about cage matches it has a lot of violent matches on it and a lot of classic cage matches but the reason why i i am giving this 4 stars is because most of the matches on here are jips matches joined in progress it would have been better if all the matches were full but on disc 2 it has 7 full matches but that is still no enough matches this dvd is worth a buy but remeber only 7 matches are full
i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years and i still ca n't make it all the way through the level 2 '' workouts this video is incredibly challenging but i like that i can do the level 1 '' workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts this is a great dvd
i am absolutely in love with this movie it 's a real documentary not a mocumentary but it is hilarious the special features on the dvd are n't amazing but the movie itself is absolutely wonderful
in the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from andy griffith in 1957 's a face in the crowd '' master director elia kazan gets similarly stellar results from natalie wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920 's kansas in the same year as her maria in west side story '' she has never been more affecting then she is here as deanie loomis the local butcher 's daughter deeply in love with bud stamper the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero they are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents the ruling moral code restricts deanie more than bud who ends up cavorting with a girl named juanita the indiscretion overwhelms deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state a few years later with their lives on divergent paths they meet again to come to terms with each other while the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to kazan 's sure hand and william inge 's screenplay his first directly for the screen it 's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue otherwise there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955 's picnic '' based on inge 's successful broadway play at her most beautiful wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned as the bud warren beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes deanie 's powerful fixation completely understandable there are several standout performances among the supporting cast with audrey christie as deanie 's unsympathetic mother pat hingle in blowhard mode as bud 's father and zohra lampert as angie the waitress bud meets at yale the classic wordsworth poem from which the film 's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie and i still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time i see this movie the 2001 dvd unfortunately has no extras
this is the best batman volume yet ! the old robin dick grayson travels around the world and becomes nightwing a new robin fights by batman 's side tim drake and batgirl is part of the group many villains look different clayface looks more like clay and bane looks more and act more like a freelance assasin i will now tell you how good each episode is disc 1 holiday sins of the cold double you scratch my never disc 2 joker 's growing love is a torch the ultimate over the disc 3 mean cult of the animal old the demon disc 4 legends of the dark superman 's nite mad beware the judgement

whats not to like about ct i own this dvd and the audio double cd thats me thats all you 'll need what really makes it worth it is the commentary '' a fabulous and totally hillarious walk thru of all the songs on the dvd i can think of no other band that has the ability to laugh at themselves like these guys do that humor along with superior musicianship makes them as well as this dvd a must have !
the boys take the stage on their hometown for a silver '' anniversary concert and pull out all the stops guest stars abound along with a host of other musicians add to the celebration and the crowd was indeed rabid all the songs are represented here that ct fans expect and are delivered with verve all band members are represented here and even former bassist jon brandt joins in for his album cuts the dvd offers up a nice selection of extras including rick nielson hamming it up for the camera off stage and on stage of course cheap trick wails and all is right in the world now for the negatives from this release sound is just okay after some heavy eq work i was able to get a very good sound from my sony 5.1 system but camera work is indeed lacking cameras used for long shots had badly overexposed pictures much of the time and many of the handheld shots were in wrong position but that may have been an editing problem all in all i give the performance and production 3 stars a very generous
this 1954 musical release is just too fun to pass up adam howard keel oh my god what a voice needs a wife and zeros in on milly jane powell to drag back to his oregon territory farm and six unruly brothers the tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge milly makes believers out of them the brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town whoops they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets for winter the songs are lovely the story charming but it 's the dance choreography that brings me back again and again there are two numbers in particular which showcase the brothers ' dance skills and they are outstanding julie newmar of catwoman fame is one of the kidnapped cuties they stick her in the back or whisk her out completely for the more involved dance routines but who cares it 's julie newmar
you know you have a hit on your hands when even your boys want to sit and watch this wonderful video over and over again ! i pass them walking around the house humming the music and even asking for art materials to try some of the things they have seen in the video best educational video i have seen for motivating the creative side of children and it has motivated me to buy other brainy baby videos try wo n't be dissapointed !
this movie may not be for everyone but to me it 's highly memorable possible spoiler alert this is n't your ordinary travel back in time to alter the futures of people you care about '' back to the future although granted it was better made and more entertaining butterfly effect is really about in alphabetical order acceptance chance charity choice grownup love hope identity opportunity regret and sacrifice some reviewers mentioned the quality of acting here are my thoughts kutcher to me always seemed an innocent caring small town fellow more than the fun guy most of us might know him as and that 's why i was n't surprised to see him pull off this role amy smart was good mostly but glaringly at times granted she had to show more range the the other actors
this definitely is one of the best movies to own ! ! if you have n't seen it yet you should if you 've seen the movie blood in blood out '' then you should definitely see this one if you have n't seen either one then i reccommend you buying them both as a combo pack or separately if you want to save i do n't know which one i love more out of the two because i know i 've watched each movie more then 30 times both movies are pretty similar to each other but blood in blood out '' kinda focuses on the 3 brothers and the paths each of them takes where as american me '' focuses on the paths of the main characters in this movie like santana puppet lil ' puppet etc but not only does it show their lifestyles but it also focuses on how its having an effect on their families and how their families feel about the life that their kids are leading american me '' i think involves more of the family in this picture and culture la raza then blood in blood out '' does it also shows its origin like the pachuco 's zoot suit 's zoot suit riots this movie is pretty close to 5 stars in my book to me i think it definitely is star better then blood in blood out '' becuase this one seems to have alot more of a story line to it and more characters its focusing on both in and outside the prison if you 're not sure about owning it rent it first but i can pretty much guarantee that you 'll eventually end up owning it
an intriging suspense film with a shocking ending the clues are obvious throughout the film but the viewer is nevertheless surprised and possibily amazed alan rickman shines as david weinburg the social climbing husband his performance shows his versality as an actor for viewers who like suspense dark harbor is a must
this excellent dvd gives us a remarkable version of martin scorsese 's film it has been color corrected by scorsese himself and remastered for superior sound quality the concert on thanksgiving day in 1976 was the final concert of the band with its original lineup numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion the band were clearly at the top of their game that night despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them classic songs like up on cripple creek '' stage fright '' and they night they drove old dixie down '' are given excellent rendtions the guest stars seem to be having a good time with backing by the band themselves ronnie hawkins does an outstanding who do you love '' john does his classic such a night '' joni mitchell performs her underrated coyote '' a ' van morrison rocks the house with caravan '' and blues legend muddy waters does a spectacular mannish boy '' in a making of '' featurette scorsese says waters ' perforance of this song was almost not filmed because most of the cameras ran out of film fortunately one cameraman caught the whole song so we can have this excellent performance neil young eric clapton and bob dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of the band the dvd also incudes two commentaries one features scorsese and robbie robertson the other features levon helm garth hudson and guests stars hawkins and mavis staples they all have good stories to tell and serve to enhance the film quite well a previously unseen jam and an eight page booklet written by robertson round out the dvd i highly reccomend this dvd to this classic film 's many fans
welcome to the lower east side where the apartments of the abut the tenements on the riverside here joel mccrea a poor architect is infatuated with rich girl wendy barrie while poor girl sylvia sidney pines for him all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets into the scene strides humphrey bogart as a wanted killer coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the dead end kids in what would be the first of many screen appearances of which sidney 's brother is the leader the film is based on a play and boy can you tell the studio set is deeply obvious as such and the structure is too carefully symmetrical the social symbolism is subtle as a sledgehammer and the script is too caught up with being worthy bogart 's performance is a striking one however and his character stands out as fully realized when compared to the walking social messages incarnated by sidney and mccrea the dead end kids also known as the east side kids the bowery boys and the little tough guys would show again the following year in angels with dirty faces and viewing the two films together is instructive showing among other things the difference between mgm 's gloss which sat uneasily on a gangster story and warner 's far more convincing grit the mono track is in good shape the print is in pretty good shape but there 's no hiding the fact that this is a film from 1937. the trailer is here and nothing else the menu is basic once celebrated with oscar nominations this film now seems rather silly compared to the warner gangster films of the same period but it has a definite historical value and certainly deserves its release
this continuation of the anne series on screen is very well done and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did the only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers what it really does is just focus on a few key incidents and drastically truncates anne 's college and teaching experiences morgan harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of roy gardner sophy sinclair old gibson and pauline and elizabeth this installment ends with anne and gilbert becoming engaged i highly recommend it just do n't expect the same level of detail as anne of green gables '' provided
what a complilation ! much better than what availiable out there on him it was good to see some of the old clips from the sixties of marvin i know that there 's got to be more i especially liked the clip with tammi terrell i was great to see her flirting with him while they were performing that 's the stuff of legends i hope motown continues this series of dvd 's with their other acts
brilliant is an often overworked phrase but in the case of starring mel gibson the word can not be used enough for brevity 's sake i will save zeffirelli 's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing this review is for chris devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult shakespeare script devore somehow makes it better were he in london late 1500 's he would have been a collaborator making will 's work the pearl it is today my only plea is that at some date we will get to see gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared this may have been glenn close 's best work this is not a complaint but rather a sign that anyting else she may have or has done can not be any better than this wonderful small role ophelia close has an important commentary that must be heard in order for the play to work will was no fool and it needs a close to do it alan bates has been a staple of english theatre and screen and has delivered many fine parts such as gabriel oaks in from the madding 1967 as claudius the regicide and brother of hamlet senior bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble except for that one small cancer that flaw in his character very clintonian and very believable i have wanted to kick ian holm 's ever since ash hurt ripley in 1979. i have to keep reminding myself that he really is that believable and that i really do n't hate him it 's the character he has created so well his body of work is repleat with characters of such believability that you forget his name ian holm until he does it again the next time in the next movie if films were strictly hasidic holm 's version of polonius would be kosher there is not one piece of ham in his entire performance it is worth the purchase of the dvd just to see him act everyone is good in the movie and there is not time to talk about all of them but a note to those whose noses are airbourne and wo n't tolerate anyone but olivier as hamlet there are several uneven performances in his excellent movie there are no uneven performances in this piece finally we come to the mad prince of denmark it is most astonishing that i watched this epic again after mel 's dark night of the troll thrashing about in complete insanity arguably brought on by hard likker frustration and stupidity yet with all said gibson is the essential hamlet you will find no other actor who delivers the goods the way the cruiser from the boozer does you know this is true not just by watching the exquisite performance on the dvd but by gibson 's own marvelling at what was accomplished not because of some actor 's raison d'etre but rather by the actor 's very ability to understand that he is dealing with things that go beyond the ken of normal humans is hamlet crazy or crazy like a fox and when is he crazy we get to hear mel say in the devastating interview he made for the dvd release many years gone by so enough from me if you want to see the best hamlet ever buy this dvd and feast dick anderso

the danny boyle directed trainspotting '' was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of scottish heroin addicted losers while the film garnered accolades i found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted ewan mcgregor playing mark renton and his crew which included full monty '' star robert carlyle as violent psycho begbie swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high congregating in a filthy deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high as a group they 're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix mcgregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories in a humorous scene cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories he then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them mcgregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations escaping to london and working as a realtor his buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life mcgregor and carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true big drug deal they manage to complete the deal for pounds which mcgregor decides to steal he intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew fat chance

an excellent movie about a smart conman who eventually ends up rendering his skills to the fbi the movie is not just about this but a lot of subtle things like the relationships between abagnale and his dad some of the scences were very well picturized silent mutual giggle which abagnale leonardo and his dad exchange as they walk out from the school principal 's office tom hanks enquires with abagnale 's dad if he know where leonardo is his dad replies that 'if you had son you will know that it is your son whom you love more than anything else' overall it is one of the best movies i have seen everything in this movie deserves 5 stars
this dvd is explaining things better than the previous version where there were lot of gaps in understanding some of the areas of quantum theory etc some of the theories are wonderfully animated and explained the on water meditated upon by the japanese monk was especially awesome they have tried their best to explain stuff that cant be easily explained by the western modern science ofcourse ends in letting you ponder have left most of it there there after one has to go into religion and spirituality particularly one place where to begin looking for would be at the sanathana dharma '' teachings
i can not recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie which is my favourite from the 1980 's by far the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in big business '' that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood 's golden age a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely does n't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in big business '' it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york 's business world the story begins in a flash back when wealthy new yorkers hunt and binky shelton are passing through rural backwater jupitor hollow when binky goes into labour at the same time locals garth and iona ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of sadie and rose but are also mixed up we move forward forty years to where sadie shelton is the corporate head of moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of holomade the local industry in jupitor hollow getting wind of their plans the militant jupitor hollow resident rose ratliff decides to go fight these pinstriped trouser snakes '' on their own territory and sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring jupitor hollow through a mix up they end up staying in the plaza hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as sinks in the living room '' and soaps in the shapes of swans '' ! complication piles on top of complication as sadie shelton 's ex husband michael barry primus ca n't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural sadie for his hard nosed wife and jay marshall michael gross ca n't for the life of him understand why rose ratliff is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure rose shelton all comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two sadie 's are really the city sheltons while the two rose 's are really the twins meant to be in jupitor hollow the fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when sadie shelton is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to sadie ratliff to put all her watching of her idol alexis carrington in dynasty '' to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing jupitor hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins on the classic 1960 's comedy series the patty duke show '' i dont think i 've ever seen bette midler in finer form than in big business '' her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails sadie shelton who 's all hostile takeovers '' to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin sadie ratliff who only wants to be able to say keep the change ! '' is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter her classic mirror sequence with her twin '' is a total riot and her statement that this whole thing has got ufo written all over it ! will have you breaking up with laughter equally lily tomlin as both country activist rose ratcliff i 'm gon na go kick some snooty new york ass ! and as rose shelton the awkward out of place city girl i hate shopping and i hate new york in june ! is also top rate her rejection of jay 's engagement ring as a supposed bribe '' and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a great big belly scraping pile of cow plop ! is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene i never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening i have of this movie of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at new york 's plaza hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk 's joe grifasi continual mixing up of sadie which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined and especially fabio alberici 's michele placido total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with one minute they are corporate killers the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone ! the hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women one from the country and the other from the city seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff it is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both bette midler and lily tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first classics like im gon na dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease ! '' oh my god it 's so cosmopolitan '' oh sure its full of crowds smog sex fiends and white slavers it 's a pistol i 've got about as much use for it new york as a toad has for spit pearls ! computer chips they 've got their ways ! and have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more it is a real pity that big business '' so far has marked the only time that bette midler and lily tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle this film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages i 've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as i am ! so i 'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you have n't already you wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends in bette midler and lily tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in big business '' enjoy !
warning ! this is not for children seeing death real destruction and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on is not for the young with that being said this is the real deal what you probably did n't see on the nightly news great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of new york city that fateful day if you never want to forget what happened the day that changed america you must have this dvd
this documentary gives a brief introduction to which if you did n't know already is the main arab language newschannel it is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it 's willingness to go where other and controlled arab networks wo n't tread in this sense it is more than a mere arab cnn in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media the filmmakers here interview personel as well as some american journalists and the american official which liases with for centcom the american central command in the present irak war which happens to be 30 miles from al jazeera headquarters it covers the timeline from just before the war to just after bush anounced main millitary operations to be over by striving to be neutral the documentary allows you to see how see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world they are very disappointed in the united states but adhere strongly to its values also interesting is how being on the arab side '' gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values like when they are angered by pentagon protests at their having showed images of us prisoners when western media routinely show iraki pows an unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be the american liaison does n't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source and as if that were n't enough he is barely articulate in english and clearly does n't know anything about the local context and history another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials but does n't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists irritating the very people they are trying to win over all in all it 's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds it gets four stars rather than five because of it 's sometimes amateurish handling of flow which makes it at times a bit unfocused
i found this dvd to be well produced and engaging to go along with the powerful content fantastic loads of deleted scenes that are very worth watching
this movie will make you laugh cry and think it 's definitely a good date movie bring a box of kleenex though
seems like there was a time in the where mainstream filmmakers took their art and their audiences seriously this gem about courtroom corruption is one of pacino 's best movies and his final courtroom monologue is as good as any in film
this has to be the best of the alien films ! this film although not as scary as the original i mean that it did not scare me as much as alien it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first also this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series go on buy the collector 's edition of the first and this and enjoy
i was a bit skeptical about jogging in my home but wanted a little boost from the two mile walk i had been doing if you are at all skeptical do n't be ! i have used 4 of leslie 's programs and for me this one takes the cake it 's fun it 's fast paced and it works up an awesome sweat you can feel the calories burning with this one it 's well worth the 10 or so dollars
product was in great condition i got the product quickly and was very satisfied
i woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of fellini satyricon someone is mortally wounded the blonde guy and lies there dying watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired gitone and some dancing leaping black guy i think i 've seen it probably 9 times it always was a favorite when i was a teen and older but i have n't seen it for years but it was so visually entrancing and so truly that is made from that standpoint which movies seldom are or can be ! i just remember the wonderul images a boat rising in the mist the strange tenement bldg they ascylto and encolpio live in the sea monster the bacchanale the hermaphrodite 's cavern the minotaur endless splendid dreamlike images on and on i wonder why it is italians are such master of the visual in this manner i think of visconti antonioni even scorsese and the maybe it 's that renaissance artist legacy from my buddy like you i saw it a few times decades ago the images are so strong and mysterious images that render volumes of emotions that are so deep echoing a memory that is never realized modern day scorsese manages it zefferelli too that is true even the older films from de sica capture images that are unforgettable wells has done it but what you 're talking about is i suppose secular in nature icons derived from the human experience that has meaning from within the human soul not from an outward omnipresence of theology satyricon is almost existential as a presentation of true human nature done with and framed in such a way that is evocative amazing dream art !
this is too good to be true after purchasing this based on reviews alone my partner and i sat down to watch it not knowing what was about to take place for the next three hours we were absolutely shocked and entertained this has got to be one of the most original shows ever to be created its got it all comedy drama and twisted minds i have to admit i 've taken a few lessons from jill and her methods do work seriously though it was just plain amazing and i hope series two will be out soon it is not for the easily offended but for those there is always the brady bunch the lamest thing ever to grace television for the rest of us well nighty night highly recommended
gilbert gottfried is a genius thank you for making a dvd that puts so many dirty jokes where they long together ! of course i knew a few but i learned so many more ! gilbert 's delivery is priceless and his impressions of comics like bill cosby and jerry seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier if you 're a fan of filthy humor this dvd is a must have ! my personal favorite is about the guy who does n't know if his wife has vd or tb and at 13.99 it 's a steal do not miss this one
more than male '' and female '' more than your view or her view or my view or any one person 's view of what makes male '' and what makes female '' and everything in between sexuality gay straight bi asexual etc is different than gender and can have nothing and yet sometimes everything to do with the other there are gay men and straight me and bisexual men too whatever they identify as has no impact on whether they are also transsexual and seek into a body that fits them more it 's not some sick fetish or crazy delusion surgery hormones these are risky ! and they would not be undertaken unless other options had been explored and found unable to cease the ache inside gender identity disorder gid is real transition the process of taking hormones living as the preferred gender in all things surgery etc is not a cure but it can make life bearable and i think it 's funny that still male to female transsexuals are regarded more often as real '' and the female to male transsexuals are ignored raci has known she was trans it appears most of her life she started taking hormones while she was still in what should have been her male puberty so of course she looks more feminine '' but that does n't make her any more or less of a real woman '' than the other mtf gabbie gabbie is a lesbian while raci is straight see how this works gabbie likes women raci likes men it has nothing to do with one being right '' and one being wrong '' there is a world of difference between a man relating to a woman and a woman relating to a woman just as a man relating to a man a man relating to a woman and it 's not all sexual it is entirely plausible that a man would transition into a woman and still be attracted to women hello the gender changed not who they were attracted to ! i 'm just so tired of seeing so many people picking apart transsexuals we are not here for your amusement we are not here to be some star in your porn show we are real and these kids do an amazing job showing that but i see that the majority of reviewers are more wound up over the sick fetishes '' and one mtf being more female convincing than the other i would love to see the same folks who brought us this a more emotional struggle to also do one documenting the physical changes that happen and how ftms in particular struggle with the emotional effects of wil
i am not sure why the first person would direct people to read michael bailey 's work or why the second person would say that it is as if michael bailey wrote this himself one he could n't have because it is a documentary and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community and he was forced to resign from northwestern university as the department head because of his illegal uses of his patient 's information in his book they seem like different species because they are '' i am not sure if i would say that the kids in this documentary are another species or even that i am another species they are humans as well and to reduce them to another species is simply rediculous i am not sure why everyone is referencing him because his view on transgender people is extremely negative but to the documentary i think that it gives a great overall view of the trans community showing that we can stem from all different backrounds and we can act in all different ways just as there are many different normal '' gendered people there are many different trans people as well i believe that scubaotter '' has the best overview of it
i have found pick your spot pilates to be absolutely perfect ! i can choose which spot i want to for the day or do them all i usually walk first then add a 10 minute pilate workout to wrap it up while my muscles are still warm i would highly recommend this workout video
an excellent comedy kindergarten cop brings to the screen the story of a detective that goes undercover to find a key witness and track down a dangerous criminal what complicates things is that it 's arnold schwarzenegger and he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher the film combines comedy with action and adventure though it is primarily a comedy and a great one at that ! arnold schwarzenegger ! and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! very well written and very well presented it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again ! the setting the plot the dialogues the humor and the music are all wonderful ! in short kindergarten cop is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection if you have n't done so already !
cop john kimble arnold schwarzenegger gets more than he bargained for when he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to pursue murderous drug dealer cullen crisp richard tyson while at the same time protecting the man 's young son pitted against a classroom full of rowdy moppets whose monkeyshines try his patience and test his mettle kimble may have finally met his match in more ways than one
my 3 year old son loved this movie he sat in front of the tv with his model blue angel and mimicked every move the planes made in the video it was fun to watch my son and husband watch this video together they both had big smiles on their faces the pilots in this video send a wonderful message to young children with dreams my 3 year old says when i get big i am going to fly blue angel 5 '' i highly reccomend this video
since i 've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items i 'm not gon na repeat anything about each show see individual reviews for that i will just rehash what i have all along despite its missing pieces from the book the original is still 5 star material the in betweener '' is only worth it 's value because it is a disc copy as opposed to a tape copy my advice buy the original separately and read the book to get the real missing years '' if you are building a library of all richard chamberlain '' then buy both or this combo but be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged missing years '' has to offer again see separate review
i found this series to be fun gritty and lifelike the characters in the precinct remind me so much of guys i used to work with on the job certainly some artistic license is taken but for the most part this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs denis leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian but a really talented character actor his supporting cast fits well and all in all i would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of rescue me or denis leary
a great look at decisions that shaped history and nearly killed all of us this with the more recent kennedy biographies for a wider sobering context this is the sort of thing that the bush administration should have watched before deciding to invade iraq
this is probably one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen those who do n't think it 's funny are those who are easily offended if you are easily offended or politically correct you probably wo n't enjoy this film having said that if you like vampires you wo n't necessarily dislike this film i completely disagree with the reviewer who said if you like vampires you will not like this movie '' that 's crap i love movies and i loved this movie believe it or not not all vampire fans are some of us are actually well rounded the person who compared it to polanski 's repulsion '' needs to get away from the bong while both deal with mental insanity the same can be said about a lot of films repulsion '' was just disturbing and weird and not overly entertaining polanski 's work is highly overrated and pretentious we watch films to be entertained not to have whatever it is polanski tries to pull having said all this this is definitely not a film for everyone it was way ahead of it 's time when it was made had it been made now there would likely be a huge cult following behind it but then again maybe not as liberal as most like to imagine themselves we still live in a country of highly uptight people easily offended and unable to laugh at the things we fear or find disturbing if you 've got a sick sense of humor add this to your video library because if you are n't going to be able to laugh at it you are n't going to enjoy it
loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries very funny and moving yes i 'm a romantic ! it 's awesome !

it is nice to see bebe neuwirth in something other than cheers oscar aaron stanford is too sophisticated for girls his age but not for his stepmother sigourney weaver and bebe neuwirth the seductress women are all over him his stepmom ignores him and chiropractor thinks she finds the romantic she 's always dreamed of the joking innuendos are quite hilarious reminding me of the graduate gary winnick the director shot this movie on a digital camera in two weeks and won raves at the festivals the little captions before or after a scene kinda tell you how oscar is working or getting worked over john ritter dad apparently serious but funny and the whole cast gives strong performances certainly earning their street creed you 'll find charming nuggets of truth in this movie quite a bit of wit and hilarity sure oscar is 15 and rather than opening his eyes to girls they open his his daydreams about his stepmom are electrifyingly filmed as for the morality i think people are a little paranoid over this taut striking film if you are openminded you 'll find this film is more about coming of age than what narrow minded people think it is a light film to the touch and men will probably be reliving high school fantasies about the older woman women will like it because it shows how men are nothing more than putty in their hands it is just amazing how much depth this film has in 77 minutes ! rachel alice hunter chairwoman teardropfilms entertainment corporatio
from the sisyphean say what misadventures of a kind of black laurel and hardy duo anthony anderson and lahmard tate who steal an atm machine with no money in it that they ca n't open to the white dude who thinks he 's black to cedric the entertainer who thinks that rosa parks got too much credit for parking her butt on the bus to sexy and saucy eve who always loves the wrong guy this is one fine piece of entertainment and ice cube as calvin who owns the shop ai n't so bad himself although he sure has to frown a lot well he 's got troubles right here in the windy city he 's always got an entrepreneurial scheme up his sleeve that just does n't quite work out which causes him to fall behind in his property taxes now this might not be such a big deal but the barbershop has been in his family for three generations and it serves as a kind of neighborhood club where people can hang out and shoot the breeze it 's a beloved kind of place enter lester wallace the loan shark with muscle who makes calvin an offer he ca n't refuse well he does refuse it or at least he tries but wallace ai n't the kind of dude to take a refusal can calvin save the barbershop that 's the question of the main plot line but what really makes this movie such a treat are the barbershop that are neatly tied together and the fine repartee and what makes that work is that everything in the film is seen from a point of view inside the black community and not from somebody else looking in which never works but is often tried add a warm and redemptive ending and there ai n't nobody cryin ' but see this for tim story who directed and got it all right and for mark brown don scott and marshall todd who wrote the neat and very funny script

if playwright tennessee williams 's southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters this is clearly evidenced in this collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of hollywood in the 1950 's and early 1960 's all directed by true filmmaking masters probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now the best of the set are elia kazan 's a streetcar named desire '' and john huston 's the night of the iguana '' the others are kazan 's baby doll '' richard brooks ' cat on a hot tin roof '' jose quintero 's the roman spring of stone '' and brooks ' sweet bird of youth '' a feral smoldering marlon brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish stanley kowalski in 1951 's a streetcar named desire '' and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen intriguingly one of the extras included in the set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of brando when he was 23 and his stardom seems assured even then the plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between kowalski and his visiting blanche dubois a fading southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown having proven her ability to be a convincing southerner in gone with the wind '' vivien leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability strong supporting work comes from kim hunter as blanche 's naive sister stella and karl malden as blanche 's seemingly respectful suitor mitch now over ninety malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track and film historians rudy behlmer and jeff young provide more objective commentary on another track film critic richard schickel 's 1995 look at kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk and there is also a more interesting documentary on the film and original broadway show the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the dvd version of the film 1964 's the night of the iguana '' deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people but this time the setting is a dilapidated mexican beach resort where reverend shannon newly defrocked has taken a group of spinsters from a women 's college huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations striking visuals and dark humor richard burton is in peak form as shannon and there is also sterling work from deborah kerr as the spinsterish hannah and especially ava gardner as the slatternly resort owner maxine faulk the dvd contains a recent featurette and a vintage video both fascinating baby doll '' is an entertaining hoot that does n't seem as sensationalistic as i 'm sure it was when the film was first released in 1956. it 's simply a farce about the potential deflowering of a old child bride with a nice pouty turn by carroll baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by karl malden as her randy husband cotton mill owner archie 1958 's cat on a hot tin roof '' is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of brick as an asexual protagonist this in spite of stellar performances from elizabeth taylor paul newman and burl ives newman is even better as gigolo chance wayne in 1963 's sweet bird of youth '' and he is matched all the way by geraldine page 's performance as faded movie queen alexandra del lago a role that would have ironically been ideal for ava gardner the weakest film of the set is 1961 's the roman spring of stone '' about an aging american actress living in rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo a decade after streetcar '' the leigh excels in the title role while a young warren beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo paolo even though his accent is a little too emphatic all four of these movies come with featurettes and original trailers and cat '' also includes commentary from williams ' biographer donald spoto the focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary tennessee williams ' south '' which highlights insightful interviews with williams in the new orleans area the film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary you can have the privilege of seeing broadway 's original blanche dubois jessica tandy and compare her work to leigh 's as well as an impressive turn by maureen stapleton as amanda wingfield in the glass menagerie '' this is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of century american cinema
when i first watched this tv movie with an unusal turn by lucille ball as a homeless woman i was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished bag lady '' although definitely within the tv movie '' league this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy

this is worth buying just to see 1. the look on pete townsend 's face when billy idol as cousin kevin puts his arm around pete 's shoulder 2. steve winwood realizing he does n't actually know the words to the listening to you i get the music '' section of the last song 3. roger daltrey fumbling with a microphone that he 'd tossed in the air and unsuccessfully attempted to twirl and catch 4. some of the most hilarious haircuts and outfits in the history of rock and roll 5. the only halfway decent thing phil collins as uncle ernie ever did in his entire career this 3 dvd package also includes quadrophenia and the second set from the night that tommy was recorded this second set is full of hits and it 's definitely worth watching you could purchase tommy and quadrophenia individually but you 'd miss out on this hits disc
i 've heard it said that if you have n't read the book you 'd be lost in this movie i read the book and it was still a bit confusing ! i like this version of the film with all the extra footage such a fantastic looking picture this was i saw this in the theater when it came out i remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing sting was touted as starring in this film when in reality he had a supporting role shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band the police it was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater having said that sting is actually pretty good in this film he sneers he wise cracks he fights and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo of course he gets killed in the end oh well
this is one of the best sci fi films from the 70 's not to be missed
although i enjoy pilates and yoga i need a good workout that makes me sweat boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose but there are times where i prefer to feel the burn at home to that end one of the best dvd workouts i 've found is crunch boot camp training '' the workout runs for about 30 minutes which is great for those days where i want a shorter but still effective one it 's short because exercises are combined together in order to minimize time and maximize benefit for example pound hand weights are used to work the upper body while doing squats and lunges abs and obliques are worked on the floor with different types of crunches and during standing cardio work by side knee lifts of course a boot camp workout would be incomplete without pushups there are three sets each with a different emphasis to shake things up and the lower body is worked in as well a session concludes the proceedings as for the instructor susan hitzmann is one of the best i 've seen on a dvd workout she has an infectious enthusiasm that challenges and encourages at the same time she calls well using a clear and authoritative voice i also enjoyed the chemistry between her and the rest of the class this is one of the few dvd workouts where i can identify with the assistants because they look like they are actually working out they moan groan and laugh like real people and plastic smiles are kept to a minimum finally the generic accompanying music complements the workout without overwhelming it there are two caveats for crunch boot camp training '' first it might be hard on someone with sensitive knees because there are a lot of squats and forward lunges i had an acl recon years ago so i usually do backward lunges in place of the forward ones the workout also features backward lunges also the routine 's fast pace and combinations may confuse or wear out beginners but easier variations are demonstrated by a woman on the instructor 's left side so this is a workout you can grow into even so if your body takes time to get limber due to age or previous injury you may want to warm up on your own beforehand crunch boot camp training '' is an excellent boot home workout i own a large number of exercise dvds and this one 's on my stack highly recommended
well i thought it was going to stop at volume 1. but i guess it did n't but i am amazed that some of the cast is still living i ca n't believe that skip hinnant who plays fargo north decoder has got gray hair and still seems to be in good health not to mention jim boyd who plays arthur crank is also still alive but on the heavy side as for judy graubart i ca n't believe how old and skin and bones she is she must 've been the oldest actor on the cast because now you should see her today hattie winston poor thing i think she must 've suffered a stroke or something cause i 've noticed in her interviews she twitches every now and then we hardly ever see morgan freeman in any of these interviews because he 's a big time busy actor but i loved the show and am glad they brought this collection together in another set of dvd 's from a show i grew up watching when i was 10. luis avalos who i loved watching not just on the electric company but in his acting career in movies like stir crazy and then a full role in dom deluise 's hot stuff along with his family luis still looks the same but has gained some weight too like jim boyd it is great that the graphics and color of the sets on each show brings back memories and the songs they sang too brought back some memories it is also hard to believe that the voices you hear on the cartoon skits like letterman are zero mostel gene wilder joan rivers and mel brooks you would n't have thought that there voice talents would be a credit to their success today well now we have to get ready for volume 3 there be let 's hope so cause i will surely buy it !
we recently purchased this dvd for our three year old son who is obsessed with john deere tractors he watches it over and over again until we ca n't take it anymore the songs are catchy and you will find yourself humming along even if you do n't mean to if you have a child who loves john deere then this is a perfect dvd for them
what do i think of when someone says disney ! '' hmmm kiddy films girly stuff princess groan we do n't need more of that ! dreams come true and cheesy yep all of the things above are in ice princess with some fresh twists with the mean rival '' changed to nice rival '' and add with hard work '' after dreams come true '' i mean look at sleeping beauty and cinderella what did they do to make their dreams come true which is a pathetic one to marry a prince one had a beauty sleep and the other had a to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand ! casey carlyle was totally different i agree with people that it 's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time which is one of the reasons i give this film a 4 and not a 5. but it 's an improvement the cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done and while people on imdb say that they 're to showy it is true but aww come on this is a movie not a real competition and everybody likes some nice in movies the acting is great especially michelle trachtenberg and hayden panettiere michelle 's acting is really good and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements hayden panettiere 's acting is also good but it 's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and '' ish '' ish would mean that she 's almost perfect she 's smart good at sports and extremely popular also it is very unfair because on the page i 'm writing this review on it says ice princess widescreen edition cusack i know she and kim catrall or the ones with fame and do n't mistake me the acting is good but casey and gen completely steals the stage and in the place of joan cusack it should be the names of those two the soundtrack is wonderful especially reachin ' for heaven and no one delicious songs ! and reachin ' for heaven is currently competing with forty something other songs for a place in the oscar nominations list good luck
as usual with a bruce willis movie there has to be things blowing up or catching on fire and there was interesting house and mostly believable villains who are the the underlying story of the rich dad his swindles detracted from it i think
to have these three classics for this low price is fantastic one film is the 1938 version of the classic christmas carol this one starring reginald owen as a very respectable scrooge if you can refrain from comparing him to alastair sim you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of scrooge and it is a fine one owen is truly miserly and wretched as befits scrooge and very believable the overall production is wonderful the only drawback was the casting of terry kilburn as tiny tim way over the top to the point where he is annoying but all in all a great version and ann rutherford as the ghost of christmas past is fascinating christmas in connecticut is very satisfying a real new england christmas with barbara stanwyck in one of her lighter roles this is enjoyable for those who are alone over the holidays and a great film to watch with family for those who will have a traditional holiday with family and friends i saved the best for last boys town this is absolutely one of my favorites with mickey rooney in one of his definitve cocky roles no one could touch a mickey rooney performance in this type of role he cornered the brash market as he proves in this movie it is a real treat to watch him interact with spencer tracy the finest actor hollywood has ever produced imo he has dignity he commands respect simply by virtue of his own quiet firm presence the other boys were great complements to the production all very natural and bobs watson particularly in his role what a great actor he was ! if you can find a copy see him with cedric hardwicke and lionel barrymore in on borrowed time '' a real i wish i could have been on the set of this one ! they must have had a ball when i saw it as a child i thought it was a movie therefore fantasy and not real when i found out that father flanagan was indeed real as was boys town it gave the movie even more of a dimension and interest his tenet there is no such thing as a bad boy '' is touching in its simplicity and pure simple faith father flanagan 's secret for success with even the most recalcitrant youth was this faith and his refusal to accept any boy 's lack of or belief in himself with ff all things were possible when spencer tracy was voted best actor at the academy awards that year he became the first actor to win the award two years in a row the first was for his part as manuel in captains courageous '' being the gracious wonderful man he was he accepted his award with extreme humility and gave it to father flanagan whom he highlighted in his acceptance speech this movie has drama excitement and some very funny moments and shows the amazing versatility of a very young mickey rooney a truly great buy
i first saw this as a child during an afternoon movie '' event at my gradeschool little did i understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting nor did i appreciate the subtle moral of the film namely that good guys sometimes do finish first by the very nature of their untainted goodness oh sure i rooted for charlie and his uncle the poorest of the poor simply trying to make ends meet and who did n't despise veruca salt the bratty english tart with a pushover for a father who acted like the world was her private oyster but having recently purchased and viewed this movie on dvd with my wife and little daughter i was dazzled at how magical the chocolate factory still is even in our age of cg film wizardry and without having seen the new version i ca n't help but think that even the versatile johnny depp is not up to the task of leaping gene wilder 's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon willy wonka more impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward morality tales with universal appeal several deadly sins are on display throughout this film including gluttony vanity greed and avarice and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike the lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated and i have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the century postmodernism that hollywood has embraced i 'll have to check it out meanwhile see the classic and be charmed all over again
ok there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film the plot is pure ham and cheese a whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for dracula frankenstein the werewolf of paris and the mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life i told you it was stupid before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current you can accept a movie on the level of a police academy or earnest goes to camp then you should not have a problem with this only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like camp blood this is a masterpiece
this is a sweet story based on the cinderella fairy tale only we have sam a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake sam carries on a secret romance with the most popular boy in her high school but she does n't know the identity of her prince charming jennifer coolidge was a scream as the botoxed cosmetically enhanced tackily dressed wicked stepmother she was hilarious in legally blonde '' but really goes all out for this role quite a scene stealer was madeline zima as one of the two wicked stepsisters hilary duff is her usual adorable perky blonde self and is a delight to watch one of the funniest moments for me was at the diner that was redecorated into a fifties motif by the stepmother the poor waitresses were all required to wear pink cashmere sweaters pearls a poodle skirt with petticoats and roller skates if that is n't hard enough the waitresses had to spin as they served people or picked up orders i love when funny bits like this are slipped into movies one can just see jennifer coolidge 's wicked stepmother character instructing these poor waitresses on how to twirl as they served customers this is a great family film although i do n't have children yet i enjoy this film as a break from all the intense films aimed at adults it is fluff but very enjoyable like a cup of hot chocolate included on the dvd is hallie 's and hilary 's music video of our lips are sealed '' and a bunch of other special features as well
warning do not watch this movie if you are hungry ! if you do within the first 10 minutes you will pause it and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes i adore this movie it is a heartwarming hilarious story about a widower retired master chef and his three very different daughters ang lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking the soundtrack is amazing the scenery is magnificent and the realness of it all transport you in so that you can almost smell the food cooking i would have killed to be on that set to just sample all those dishes !
based upon director and writer oliver stone 's own experiences in vietnam platoon was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict the movie revolves around a young american soldier pvt chris taylor a young charlie sheen and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty the battle sequences are very gritty graphic and realistic taylor serves under the direct leadership of sgt elias grodin willem dafoe but both men are under the command of staff sgt bob barnes tom berenger grodin and barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict while barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war at its core then platoon is a movie about the internal war for one soldier 's soul between good and evil though stone based the film upon his own experiences there are scenes that have been embellished and the view stone presents is only one view of the war see the film we were soldiers for the opposite view as presented by stone in platoon despite the negative outlook upon life the military and the vietnam war platoon is probably oliver stone 's best movie to date stone 's direction of the film is brilliant from the boot camp the actors endured before principal filming to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes to filming in sequence to recognizing the talent of johnny depp stone illustrated in platoon was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with the film contains fine performances tom berenger willem dafoe charlie sheen forest whitaker francesco quinn john mcginley and johnny depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity despite the deep metaphysical connotations platoon won the 1986 oscar for best picture stone won the best director oscar and also received a nomination for best original screenplay i was surprised and found that i enjoyed platoon though there were several parts of the film that i found myself aghast i 've never been in battle myself but i do know that war is hell nevertheless i can not bring myself to agree with the film 's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one 's soul to evil despite this there are many positive things within the movie this is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well though they might prefer something more hopeful such as saving privater ryan or we were soldiers
this is a very enjoyable and funny movie with a heartwarming ending all michael fox fans be sure to get this ! there are many good supporting characters such as bridget fonda woody harrelson barnard hughes and julie warner

any collection that has the lost patrol has got to be worth the 40 bucks that movie and boris karloff alone is something to behold but this collection also contains sgt rutlidge which a movie way before its time mary queen of scots i was n't even aware was a john ford movie the informer another great and cheyene autumn i think this set has a little bit of something for everyone i just wish that we knew if this was the 66 minute watered down version of lost patrol or the original uncut version
if you enjoy movies with random terrorist executions religious cults andy kaufman as a mass murdering cop alien abductions bizarre sexual anatomies etc do n't we all you will love this one alone in its genre
in all her 48 movies brigitte bardot never catches public imagination with more effect than she does here paradise on earth is just around the corner she tells us making the sparks fly off your screen this edition is the new one by the way cleaned up in 2000. you will appreciate its fine use of colors that really is all there is to say about this movie but it 's enough more than enough it is exactly the reason why 'et dieu crea la femme ' and god created woman is immortal

in this set of episodes the battle city is down to the wire my favorite character marik not yami marik is the center of the events most of his character is known in this set it seemed almost if yugi was only a for a while even though i dislike dub this was still good enough for me the scene when marik talks to his brother for the last time or so he thinks at that moment is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime i 've seen if only the voice actor sounded like marik 's age for once and kept the poignant music and did n't use the gold stuff when someone 's mind is snatched and also a shame is that the ishtars wo n't appear for many episodes after this with such a simple exit
this dvd contains the basic techniques of krav maga system the techniques include attacks with hands mostly punches with closed fist but also hammer punches elbows knees and feet there are some counterattacks and defences also included at the beginning of the film they talk about angles of attack target areas and stance movement as a dvd extra they present focus mitt combinations to utilize in your training they mention that they will produce an entire film on the subject in the future it is worth mentioning that they do n't teach or even mention the correct falling technique at all also i think they should have taught also palm strikes but for some reason they were left out as palm strike is almost as effective as punch with a closed fist but much more safe for your own hand it should be included in everyones ' arsenal when instructing kicking techniques they mention casually that you can kick also to the head i think that they should have warned against that because in real life kicking above your own waist is considered risky and generally not advisable the presentation of techniques varies from fair to excellent the average being of good quality in some techniques i learned some nuances i had not grasped in my krav maga classes each technique opens up with a dramatized scene in which the technique is used after that they present the technique at full speed and after that in slow motion and finally in learning stages for some reason they have chosen not to use slow motion of a full speed presentation of technique rather the person presenting the technique is moving in slow motion according to the instructions of narrator this makes somewhat amateurish impression of the production speaking of production it is fairly the film is shot with only one camera but for the most part it is shooting at the right spot the techniques are presented in a studio against a black screen but the dramatized scenes are shot in loading docks restaurants parking lots and so on they use two narrators who take turns with narrating the techniques the other narrator is international krav maga federation head instructor eyal yanilov and the other is chief instructor darren levine yanilov does not speak very good english so from time to time it is hard to grasp what he is saying otherwise the production is good and it 's easy to understand the techniques as a krav maga practitioner myself i like the system in this film they have succeeded in presenting the basic techniques very well there are some shortcomings though that reduce one star from the rating of this film run time
the picture quality is not very good it 's like watching the videos on an old vhs tape taped off of television i 've never seen a dvd in my dvd player look so not digital the selection is okay the dvd opens playing a small clip of the tears for fears song head over heels '' even though that video is n't on the set but fear not two tears for fears videos are here i bought this because i love the level 42 video for something about you '' and i figured this was my one shot to get it on dvd buy this if you just must have it the price is a bit much for such a short little collection this should really be in the 12.99 or less range
capsule reviewer sam graham above is one jerk ! tears for fears and swing out sister are two of the best acts that came out of the and they are still going strong today ! the videos on this collection are some of the most obvious but enjoyable nevertheless it would be nice if amazon would hire somebody to write for them who at least had a little common sense when it comes to music instead of some supposedly hip '' idiot
this was n't all that funny nor did i see romance i saw instead four drama queens plus one more wearing pants unlike carrie and her pals this ai n't ex and the city three are married one is not and all deserving pity three have money one does not olivia 's a maid she walked out on her teaching job and now is underpaid franny got hers in a will jane from designing clothes christine is a writer while olivia 's debt grows despite the money that they have none of them are content insecure and neurotic and certainly high rent but if you really look at them they reflect our inner fears getting fat and getting old and thinking no one cares to enjoy this chick flick movie you have to dig down deep explore your inner feelings and then drift off to sleep rated 3.5 stars amanda richards october 29 2006
'mr smith goes to washington ' is a classic frank capra film from starring a stellar cast of some of hollywood 's best from the golden age '' of cinema it 's not only one of the greatest films of that era but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of america was something to be proud of not mocked yes it 's overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us can the young and naive jefferson smith jimmy stewart survive in the united states capital as a newly appointed senator will he check his ideals and values at the door and play the political game or will he stand up for what 's right against the powers that be '' if you 're any kind of movie buff you already know the answer one of capra 's and stewart 's best and definitely one of the essentials to any dvd collection !
i find this to be a perfect depiction of small town life being i lived for 11 years in a town quite like this one really enjoyed the movie and the acting i enjoyed most terry moore 's potrayal of betty
so this is the best i have seen from a terrible tradgedy i watched with friends with tears streaming down my face so factual and so sad
eastwood and lee van cleef what a solid combination ! better than fistful of dollars and i liked it better than the too long good bad and ugly van cleef as bad guy sorry i ca n't go for that
every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for jack ti jean '' kerouac ! to actually see most of kerouac 's fellow writer 's and poet 's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated genius '' that was this brother lowellian is in itself a magnificent production ! i bought this dvd today at a mall in new hampshire and could have bought it for less on ! just a few minutes ago i did order the dvd jack of the beats '' on and ca n't wait for its arrival ! if it 's anything like what happened to kerouac '' then it will surely be another masterful production ! after i write this review i am going to watch this dvd again and experience the same chills as i did when initially watching it for the first time ! anyone that is a true fan of kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius ! to hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of kerouac himself is truly ! this production is a brutal and factual statement of a man that was rarely understood but truly adored by those that have read the majestic prose and verse that was and still is jack kerouac
i almost gave up on this one forty minutes in do n't you do that the ending is superb premise working class girl gets dumped by her boyfriend and seeks work by housekeeping well that can lead to something better if you keep house for the right person jacques bacri who recently got walked out on by his wife and who not so incidentally looks sixty well actually he was barely fifty when this was made but you get the point gets his ad for a housekeeper answered by laura emilie dequenne who is twentysomething a young twentysomething i guess there is not much else to say and to be honest i decided i would force myself to watch the inevitable but the director is claude berri who directed two of the best movies i ever saw manon of the spring 1986 and jean de florette 1986 and so i stayed with it at about the fifty minute mark the movie started to get interesting i could feel that old girl love affair was going to take an unexpected fork in the road as yogi said if you come to a fork in the road take it the players have no choice obviously old girl can end only one way young girl leaves old guy for young guy this is biology it will be painful claude berri knows all this and probably a lot better than i do and so guess what well i wo n't tell but you will find that the last minutes of this sexy romantic comedy delightful and especially the very very clever and most satisfying ending just prior to that laura asks jacques for his blessing he wo n't give it but she is right he should and then when we get the final life is so lifelike '' grimace on jacques 's face we can only smile emilie dequenne is delightful as the strangely wise and very natural laura and bacri is winning as the old guy who knows better but on reflection should thank his lucky stars
there are so many reasons to love all things canadian national health insurance for all citizens the novelist margaret atwood and certainly leonard cohen a group of singers got together to honor cohen by singing his songs nick cave and bono kate and anna mcgarrigle rufus wainwright martha wainwright anthony et al added to their performances are footage from many periods of cohen 's life interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well we thus have this documentary that will delight cohen 's fans at 72 cohen may have lost a lot of his voice he opines that he never could carry a tune but he has lost none of his brilliant humor the singers are fantastic but why would n't they be with such words and lyrics nick cave sings probably cohen 's most song suzanne '' introduced to the public so many years ago by judy collins one wonders if the group drew straws to see who would get to sing that one anthony is great of course but the wainwrights both martha her rendition of the traitor '' will put chills on your spine and rufus who sings everybody knows '' chelsea hotel number 2 '' and hallelujah '' are not to be missed rufus ' account of meeting leonard cohen for the first time when he was feeding a young broken bird should n't surprise anyone who has listened to his lyrics over the years this film is one that those of us who love and revere this man will purchase the day it is released on dvd
i am sure that if you are looking at this then you are a fan of the trinity movies the nobody character is based on trinity but with much more refined terence hill 's nobody has a certain directness and is a much fuller character henry fonda 's career in spaghetti westerns often gets overlooked and that is a real shame if you compare this to his portrayal of wyatt earp then you can see that the love of the western never left him this is much more the fonda that one loves rather than the villian in once upon a time in the west '' itself a great film i love showing this to people that have never seen it they usally like it and then i move on the the trinity films
the reason i believe the ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a very personal unexplainable level you see the main storyline of the ring is the fact that this video tape has been created and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual twisted manner it 's up to a reporter woman named rachel to figure everything out she 's the main character of the film along with her son as i mention above something very unusual about the film effects me in a way i ca n't explain first of all the entire film is very effectively the way everything is dark and damp and for lack of better words scary ! the one thing i remembered after watching the ring are some of the things that were on that video tape the mirror on the wall and the location of the ladder are two things i could have sworn i 've seen somewhere before like a childhood memory i ca n't figure out like i 've been somewhere and seen those things before like the video tape used in the storyline actually existed before the film was released in 2003 and i believe i 've actually seen the footage on that video tape many years ago because the sequence with the mirror and the ladder looked familiar i ca n't explain what it is but this is the main reason i find the movie so delightful
i find this film to be very different to most american films it is very funny in its own way and make you think about the true meaning of money and its relationship to happyness it is on my ten best films

being copied from tv the quality came out great good choise of show
given that pornography is a business it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often but boogie nights provides it with the sort of skewed darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves and becomes a certifiable classic in the process following the story of eddie adams a almost impossibly teenager from suburban california who achieves porn stardom as dirk diggler before turning 20 boogie nights is both a story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was paul thomas anderson 's directing is as excessive and stylish as you 'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry with anderson pulling out every trick in the book long tracking shots underwater closeups montages views and some moments that approach dirk 's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example naturally anderson also loads the movie up with period details right down to the farah fawcett poster in teenage dirk 's room the platform shoes and the obligatory disco sequences its visual flair aside though boogie nights is also the sort of insanely quotable movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties trainspotting fargo goodfellas swingers true romance etc etc etc but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade this movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it especially its murderer 's row of a cast burt reynolds jack horner don cheadle buck swope john reilly reed rothchild julianne moore amber waves william macy little bill luis guzman maurice rodriguez tom jane todd parker philip baker hall floyd gondolli philip seymour hoffman scotty jay and alfred molina rahad jackson all figure prominently and even wahlberg dirk himself and heather graham rollergirl have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors that said what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like the main characters almost entirely have hopes aspirations and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession jack 's desire to be a serious filmmaker dirk 's ridiculous and reed 's equally ridiculous poetry buck 's goal of opening his own stereo store amber 's attempts to get back in touch with her son which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her helping us see them as characters not just plot devices in the story since there is n't really a plot to speak of the movie is told as a series of episodes with several extended pieces the pool party at jack 's house where gets introduced to the whole crew the new year 's eve party celebrating the start of the 's the fake drug deal gone bad at a rahad 's house serving to turn the narrative in new directions this last set piece when dirk reed and todd head over to rahad 's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt deserves special mention as it 's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory it starts off almost surreal with a skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and rahad clad only in underwear a bathrobe and slippers discoursing as he sings along to 80 's songs on a mixtape from there it just gets progressively darker and tenser with the lighting acting and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as todd kicks his robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control molina 's performance more than anything else makes the scene as he turns rahad into a manic ball of energy and later a avenging angel determined to take his revenge i would n't say molina turns in the best performance i 've ever seen in a movie but it it probably the best performance i 've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie the 's are of course the hangover from the joys of the previous decade as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product cocaine suddenly becomes addictive and dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one fittingly as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties the movie takes a darker turn becoming grittier more downcast and a lot more violent but no less compelling all the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present just in a decidedly less sunny form even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right the movie 's pacing makes it all but impossible to look away well except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end but by then i for one did n't care
it is said that suffering develops character surely when photographer zana briski went on a photography pilgrimage to the red light district in sonagchi calcutta in india she discovered more character and in smaller shape and size then she might have imagined peering through a lens into the darkest shadows of life into the world of prostitution to capture the images the world wishes not to see not at least from this angle of truth she saw between the women their children when we think of brothels however we might think of them how many think of children whether we think of these places and their inhabitants as figures of perversity embodiments of lust or the tragic painted clowns of the joke that is humanity it is probably more true than not that these women are rarely seen as well women they are perhaps at best merely meat merely body parts to be used and abused and then tossed aside what zana briski 's photo lens reveals is that these are indeed women human beings and for better or for worse also mothers daughters wives sisters we see in this montage of photos and film combined women who are deformed by the ugliness inside they are broken they are stunningly and fiercely angry at the world that has so betrayed them yet they also have their moments of hope and tenderness all of this and more falls upon the heads of their children weaving between these women are their little ones boys and girls who grow up around the perversities of lust and abuse what might such children be like this is the sharp focus of briski 's lens perhaps we need to look at ugliness to see beauty in contrast the faces and spirits of these children contain both they have in them the despair of those forgotten and betrayed by the world society all around them refuses them a place outside the red light district they are already banned from normalcy they have been witness to humans at their worst and no one outside wishes to bear the weight of such witness yet they will not be silenced and if we do not wish to hear them speak then briski has given them cameras to let them capture their worlds inside and out and bring these images to us what these children capture on film is nothing less than breathtaking they miss nothing their intense talent and power of seeing discovered this film also shows us how briski works to bring this artistic discovery to the world meanwhile also fighting to give these children a chance slim as it is to a life of normalcy key to this is education yet as she soon learns no school in calcutta wishes to enroll children born into brothels at last and with determined persistence she does find one and a portal into life beyond opens for some of the children their photos too are put on exhibit available also now in book format some are saved some are pulled back into the dark the individual stories of these tiny photographers are stories that must be witnessed heard and seen so that they know everyone matters even in the darkest shadows we refuse to be blind to them any longer
this is a wonderful story showing the universe can have aliens that are not horrors monsters or disasters for humans and humanity kids or adults can see a picture of aliens not the usual us in a strange colored costume but folks we can not see or even recognize as folks strangers with a problem seek help and after receiving help return the favor aliens that flash thru the night abducting people and destroying property are enemies aliens that come in the night make contact with local people seeking understanding and trade are far more likely representatives of extra solar beings
you will be laughing one minute crying the next then holding your breath to see what will happen next it 's a great all around movie good for the whole family
this collection of the first four road pictures is well worth having the picture quality is excellent and all four films are loaded on one disc but where are the remaining three road pictures this would have made the ultimate road collection disappointing
i love sub movies this one is one of my favorites good story and good action
most of this season is about topanga and cory breaking up and getting together i think the second season is the best though

any movie that begins with a civil war ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me although my wife thought i have started playing the wrong movie then again it was really upsetting at the film 's climax to see the texas getting shot up yes i know it is just a film but the thought of finding such a civil war artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here sahara '' begins at the end of the civil war as the confederate ironclad texas escapes from a burning richmond carrying the gold supply of the confederacy it disappears into history where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of dirk pitt matthew mcconaughey who believes the texas crossed the atlantic and ended up somewhere in africa do not ask how '' because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that dirk is right on this score dirk is partnered with al giordino steve zahn and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes technically the boys work for admiral ret jim sandecker william macy who has a hard time reining them in once dirk finds another clue about the texas meanwhile eva rojas penelope cruz of the world health organization has arrived in africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region however there is another problem in that rojas is getting too close to the truth which puts here in danger from the local dictator general kazim lennie james and his partner smarmy french rich guy yves massarde lambert wilson dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing eva and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent al is along for the ride as if rudi gunn rainn wilson for part of the way these narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director breck eisner thoughtcrimes '' the best of these is the speedboat one involving the panama '' which comes relatively early in the film i want to ask whatever happened to saving the best for last '' in a film like this but it is not like they did that in raiders of the lost arc '' so why should that happen here granted sahara '' is not as much fun as that classic film romp but it was certainly more enjoyable than national treasure '' probably because it is not as burdened by american history and national landmarks as that one and mcconaughey and zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality besides i like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine mainly because if this film is the start of a dirk pitt franchise you know al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film i especially liked sandecker 's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth knowing nothing about the original novels i would much rather see the team in action than dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film for me the end result is that sahara '' is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety but if you want more then look elsewhere
i did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80 's i had seen winds of war however and at that time i loved it now when i purchased the dvd 's both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction i particularly have trouble with accepting robert mitchum as a virile intelligent sombre alert and perceptive about pug henry i wish some filmmaker curtis would be great ! would do a remake of this entire project making it into a 4 hour feature movie tightening up the script entirely apologies to wouk who wrote the teleplay mostly keep in the historical scenes but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea and do away with some of the long soap opera dialogue scenes keep the holocaust part intact these were the most powerful holocaust scenes i 've ever seen and i 've seen most of them but have someone like kevin costner be pug henry or harrison ford and find a truly young very vibrant natalie an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence and a gorgeous rather naive rebel leading man to play byron briney we need to feel their chemistry otherwise what transpires briney 's desperate attempts to find natalie and his son seem and loved polly bergen as rhoda it might be hard to find anyone better i think and you 'd need a new hitler one who is more like the actor who played him in winds of war
as with vol 1 i bought this for my wife and she is thrilled with it
of course the movie deserves 4 stars however i wish i could say the same for the dvd what does it take for dvd company to release each dvd enhanced for tvs nothing ! recently i bought a sony bravia 32 inch display and i have a collection of over 600 dvds i learned now about enhanced for tvs '' and how important it is i did not care about it or even know about it since i own a standard tv however all my dvds are region 1 and in widescreen i never buy fullscreen dvds so i did an inventory on my collection and realized the following out of dvds 42 are not enhanced for tvs and they really look horrible when i played them on my pc anyway according to my inventory the following movies company have failed to produce anamorphic or widescreen and i hope that these company will release them in the near future so that we can enjoy them on our tvs mgm runaway train graduate no way out prizzi 's honor fx shallow grave thief house of games dead man walking misery the eye of the needle overboard paramount private parts 48 hrs coming to america primal fear the ghost and the darkness breakdown universal day of the jackal psycho available in the recent hitchcock 's boxset as anamorphic vertigo available in the recent hitchcock 's boxset as anamorphic the game fox abyss i was shocked to learn that my is not anamorphic nor is the latest digipack edition raising arizona the edge great expectations rising sun the ref romancing the stone the jewel of the nile artisan house of the spirits the last seduction the last emperor the eagle has landed bound ps please artisan instead of releasing 'basic instinct ' for the time which most have almost the same specifications consider releasing some more interesting movies with proper attention such as those mentioned above touchstone walt disney ransom what about bob ps it is a great news that touchstone are releasing 'enemy of the state ' crimson tide ' and 'con air ' in extended unrated editions on may 16. i wish though they did the same with 'ransom ' warner weeks presumed innocent note that warner studio is releasing one of the best special edition such as 'shawshank redemption ' 'heat ' 'malcolm x ' 'dog day afternoon ' 'all the president 's men ' and many many more the reason why they do n't release every dvd in widescreen enhanced for is beyond me since soon widescreen tvs will replace standard ones it is a relief that amazon is now stating whether the dvd is anamorphic or letterboxed
this wonderful tv special from the 70 's is timeless and has great music by harry nihlssen not sure of that spelling the lesson is all about tolerance with lots of side issues of great value i am thrilled to own this dvd it brought back all kinds of memories for me both the story and especially the music it is a perfect addition to my collection of movies for my grandchildren
though based on a true incident that took place in 1914 in the midst of a wwi battle among the scots the french and the germans christian carrion 's film joyeux noel '' nonetheless has a dreamlike quality that says more about the state of our current international affairs than it does about carrion 's telling of this sad sentimental tale can you imagine a contemporary world in which countries at war with each other would stop the warring long enough to drink champagne slug vodka play cards and toast christ 's birth unfortunately the bureaucrats and politicians react to this camaraderie among the different factions as they usually do they condemn the participants and accuse them of treason all of the actors do a fine job of creating characters who genuinely feel like they are fighting for ideals and ideas that will have a lasting effect on their lives and that of their children they are committed they are also of course innocent the ethereal diane kruger plays a classical singer a swede and therefore neutral but married to a german soldier who through some personal machinations as well as a pass from kaiser wilhelm finds herself on the battlefield on that special night of she sings gounod 's ave maria '' to a rapt audience of soldiers attending christmas eve mass it is the moral and emotional center of the film as well as its highpoint joyeux noel '' is a nice reminder of a gentler time a time when it was the moral and social imperative to always love your country to always trust your leaders and to always cleave to your family unfortunately that time is long gone
the documentary guerrilla the taking of patty hearst '' is a good solid look at the bizarre story behind the symbionese liberation army the sla how the sla formed what they committed and how the group was finally apprehended the film examines the political climate in america and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary sla political rhetoric aside the sla careened through california on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks but more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the sla filmmaker michael stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment using interviews with surviving sla members russ little and michael bortin as well as archival news footage of the times the documentary examines how the sla led by escaped criminal defreeze cinque zoomed into the headlines after the 1974 kidnapping of patty hearst daughter of william randolph hearst several members of the sla were berkeley students including emily harris who worked in the uc berkeley 's registrar 's office with patty hearst as a hostage the sla began making demands for food distribution for poor communities but lest one imagines that the sla members were driven by egalitarian motives it must be remembered that the sla financed their lifestyle by robbing banks during the robbing of a bank in carmichael customer myna opsahl was shot in the stomach by a shotgun blast and left there to die no doubt the most shocking aspect in the history of the sla was patty hearst 's transformation from kidnap victim to the 'tania ' renamed for an old girlfriend of che guevara who participated in several bank robberies the documentary includes televised pleas from hearst 's parents for patty 's safety audiotapes from patty announcing that she 's joined the group as well as clips of patty 's former fiance stephen weed tim findley a sf chronicle reporter who covered this bizarre case also appears adding his insightful comments the kidnapping of patty hearst and her subsequent to the sla remains disturbing and certainly raises many philosophical questions was she just an innocent kidnapping victim or was she young and impressionable enough to be influenced by the sla 's theories on class war did the fact that the hearst family is rich and powerful have any bearing on their daughter 's presidential pardon well watch the documentary and decide for yourself there 's so much to be learned from watching a documentary that explores in depth an old news item that still remains locked in the archives of one 's memory dvd extras include comments by the director michael stone the audiotapes by patty hearst footage of the hibernia bank robbery and segments of court hearings between sla members and the son of murder victim myna opsahl these speeches from the former sla members as they try to explain and justify the murder of opsahl serve as a reminder of the irrevocable damage caused by taking a life displacedhuma
certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they do n't make movies like this anymore ! from the instant when the dazzling artdeco credits appear we 're onboard for the ride of our lives actually the lives of hero cary grant and eva marie saint the plot of this 100 percent thickens as its characters sicken notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble james mason remember him and leo carroll who later played the ghost in the tv series topper superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors the elegant un an aerial shot of cary grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands and closeups of mount rushmore which hitchcock had dreamt of shooting here becoming a backdrop of drama of the films of sir hitchcock i 'd rate this in the top three with psycho and rebecca rounding out the bases
as i have found with most baby einstein movies this one engages my very active baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy while i know that watching tv too much is unhealthy she will not even give regular television a second gland which i 'm glad about however there are times when i need her to be more calm like when i change a diaper try feeding new foods and right before and after naps these movies have been lifesavers to me this one in particular is nice because it is introducing the body by identifying the same parts on babies and animals i love to give her a bath and do the head and shoulders knees and toes '' song with her and point to the different parts she also loves to stand in front of a mirror and we 'll point out our eyes mouths etc this movie is a great introduction for babies and toddlers to understand their body parts
from the sociobiological aspect the movie conveys brilliantly how the husband that does n't has access to its genetic children will resort to extreme violence it also shows how parents are excited about courtship abilities of their young son since a '' son can pass a lot of their genes with various women in his lifetime eventually it shows how the aging parents can not bare the pain from losing their only son the only way by which they can pass their genes so they resort to extreme violence even if the violence is somewhat spiteful if my son can not pass my genes your son who killed my son for a good genetic reason would n't be able to either '' that 's the subconscious motivation for murder conveyed '' by the genes
the chemistry of all of the cast members is perfect great ghetto storylines that are still relevant 30 years later top episodes james buys a gun jj 's engagement with debbie allen
plot of this one is not guide as stand out as the first rush hourm is a been more complex and sometime non sense but it turn out funny because of that comedy scene here wo n't be as class as the first but they did add alot hk style in here one which first one is lacking great cast in this set however still lacking at some element of worthy 5 star so i hoped the third one will be best in the series
the film 's title paragraph 175 '' refers to the passage in german law forbidding homosexuality paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871 and as a result homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail magnus hirschfeld a german jewish doctor and a pioneer in the study of human sexuality formed the committee with the goal of repealing paragraph 175. in weimar germany of the an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals and berlin became a homosexual eden '' but once the nazis took power they enforced laws with a vengeance according to historian klaus muller in nazi germany men were arrested for homosexuality and approximately were sent to concentration camps of that number less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made the film gently and narrated by rupert everett is built around interviews with a handful of homosexuals who survived the concentration camps once the nazis took power they moved swiftly and systematically against the homosexual community survivors detail how they clung to vain hope one man for example believed that with known homosexual ernst rohm controlling the sturmabteilung sa other homosexuals would be safe another survivor noted the homosexual clubs remained open after the nazis came to power and he took this as a positive sign before he realized that they let us keep our meeting places so we could be snatched up '' the survivors tell their painful stories one man looks through a photo album in which most of the photos have now been removed another looks at a photo of a large family gathering and is able to pick out the faces of the two relatives who survived one remembers the screams of those hung from poles one man spent years in buchenwald only to be snatched up and thrown in dachau while most of the survivors are unable or unwilling to describe their experiences in the concentration camps the grief the anger and the outrage are just below the surface paragraph 175 '' is an important gripping powerful film those incarcerated tortured and murdered for their sexual orientation should not be forgotten the movement began as a loss of civil rights and devolved into one of the most shameful episodes in history to quote one of the survivors i am ashamed for humanity '' displacedhuma
ah chris benoit one of my favorites which is why i was thrilled when i bought this dvd almost 2 years ago personally i think the documentary is good and somewhat i just would 've liked it to be longer but it starts with benoit 's early years growing up in canada then to japan then ecw wcw and finally wwe benoit 's comments make this doc pretty good despite the short running time about 75 mins but the matches are where this dvd really shines there are 15 matches in total and footage from wcw ecw and japan against opponents like jushin thunder liger black tiger eddie guerrero and great sasuke which was footage i loved seeing as it was quite rare this is a great dvd purchase do n't get me wrong my only problem is as i said the documentary it 's very good i love watching it i just wanted it to be longer
this dvd provides benoit 's life story which i found very interesting i believe they could have chosen a slightly better match selection but it was still pretty great pegasus kid vs jushin thunder '' this is the type of wrestling i love plenty of chain wrestling huge japanese crowd meaning a very quiet yet applaud filled match this match is where chris benoit became a huge star in japan benoit puts on a great match with a japanese legend wild pegasus vs the great this was another match with plenty of chains and some pretty cool high flying stuff by both guys but mainly sasuke like the liger match this was a and solid 20 minute match wild pegasus vs black tiger eddie guerrero these two have had some far better matches and this is one of those that i wished would have been replaced by something a little better still a solid match chris benoit vs too cold scorpio ecw these two have some nice chemistry together another 20 minute match ending just before the bell chris benoit vs al snow ecw many consider this to be a great match but i just could n't get into it match until towards end chris benoit vs kevin sullivan wcw nitro this was an all out brawl going all over the arena including the bathrooms very impressive finish chris benoit vs eddie guerrero wcw nitro a very solid match with these two great chemistry together eddie and benoit show abilitiese we have not seen for awhile chris benoit vs bret hart wcw owen hart tribute match this was a phenominal match bret is a true great as is benoit you just do n't see this sort of stuff nowadays chris benoit vs william regal brian pillman tribute show lighting for this match and not very active crowd besides that benoit and regal put on a classic chris benoit vs kurt angle raw steel cage match match was amazing benoit and angle are the finest chain wrestler in wwe today and they put on a classic steel cage match stone cold steve austin does guest commentary chris benoit vs kurt angle royal rumble 2003 wwe title match benoit and angle put on another classic in the of the royal rumble just a truly fantasic match with plenty of false finished submissions and moves chris benoit vs shawn michaels vs triple h wrestlemania xx world title match this is my all time favorite match the for wrestlemania xx is often called the best wrestlemania ever and it is n't surprising a long bloody match with pedigrees sweet chin musics sharpshooters crossfaces diving headbutts and breaking tables this is a for anyone who enjoys watching a good match benoit is one of the best performers in the business and this is his story i reccomend to all
i 'll admit to you that i love to watch adult swim and i 'll also admit that i like certain types of anime no i 'm not one of those nerdy poke'mon lovers i 'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time i like anime that 's made for adults like big o ! cowboy bebop trigun outlaw star tenchi and ghost in the shell i was watching either watching family guy or aqua teen hunger force when i saw previews for this show start to air on adult swim i thought thought it looked cool it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal but i did n't know the half of it what i got was a version of the old film noir mysteries the series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public in the story 'stand alone complex ' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal or in other words an imaginary criminal it also refers to the structure of each episode each episode can be viewed independently of each other and there is little if at all given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date taking place in a fictional city of japan called '' new port city in the year 2030 stand alone complex tells the story of a special operations called public security section 9 or simply section 9 '' the series follows the exploits of section 9 's agents who range from to as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as the laughing man '' public security section 9 is an elite domestic unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of acts of terrorism and crime their duties include response to serious cyber crimes cyberbrain hacking investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases from they also serve as protection to foreign vips if you have seen the movie then you know that the tv series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole the series of 26 tv episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga in comparison to the film version the series is considered by many to be easier to understand also in comparison the series can be found to be closer to the manga due to the presence of some humor the usage of the tachikomas fuchikomas in the manga and referred to simply as tanks '' in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in the design of the characters and also the usage of the characters paz bouma and saito stand alone complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of production in their application of computer generated imagery this is evident in their digital color grading environmental effects and computer models their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene which adds greatly to the atmosphere i think a lot of people will try to compare this to cowboy bebop as with so many other anime and mangas but that 's foolish stand alone complex is no better or worse than cowboy bebop it 's just a different story different style different sets of charactors and there places if you like anime or manga you 'll definitely like this show it 's complex has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it and not to mention the technology ! even if you do n't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is
my wife and i saw love actually '' when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly yes richard curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings but it works and the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in when the movie first appeared on hbo i always seem to find it and could n't stop watching until the end of the movie i bought the dvd and it 's become a family tradition to watch it christmas eve most years and it never gets old i am not a fan of christmas movies i 've never seen all of miracle on street '' or its a wonderful life '' but i 'm looking forward to sitting on the sofa with my wife to watch love actually '' again
a solid addition to the rockumentary genre this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career and arguably he was solo with the police at the time of this movie it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting the music is super the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness
john ford must have felt very fortunate although he would have never have admitted it to have had john wayne and henry fonda star in fort apache wayne and fonda were by far the great director 's favorite leading men he made wayne a star in stagecoach '' and went on to direct him in some of the best remembered westerns ever she wore a yellow ribbon '' the man who shot liberty valance '' and one of the greatest movies of any genre the searchers '' fonda appeared in many movies with ford as well including drums along the mohawk '' the grapes of wrath '' and another immortal western my darling clementine '' following a pattern that he would continue in liberty valance '' ford analyzes the mythology of the west in particular the valiant heroic cavalry officer who bravely and unavoidably leads his men to certain death thereby obtaining immortal glory fonda plays an arrogant stiff commander who will have nothing less than a struggle with cochise wayne is his subordinate trying desperately to avoid catasrophe this film has it all great performances great direction and great cinematography it is way past time that this great film be released on dvd but it is well worth the wait
i was very keen on the early poseidon adventure which i liked so i was keen to see what wolgang petersen a director i do like could do with the story it found it to being a good movie it did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next so much so i lost track of time throughout the movie having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort in which case i would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original the characters are not so interesting nor is the acting the story was better explained in the first one and more believable the special effects are approximately as good the filming however is better as the newer technology shows still it is worth looking at
this movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to it demonstrates how connected we all are as people and how seperated we are by only one thing our viewpoints the acting is superb and you get one cameo appearance after another which is a treat of course the soundtrack is terrific the ending is intense to witness one situation after another coming to an unfortunate finish
this movie has it all especially for baby boomers of the early 1970 's blethyn as a betrayed widow is priceless and nigel ferguson as her pot smoking gardener steals the movie with his characteristic good humor and good looks the english scenery is charming and blethyn 's loyal village friends top off the movie 's touching humor and happy ending i have given this dvd as christmas gifts and my friends have loved it too a must own
this is a wonderful directed by robert altman tim robbins stars as a big shot producer who begins receiving hate mail from one of his rejected writers he thinks he 's figured out who it is vincent d'onofrio goes to meet him and in a rage kills him he then falls in love with d'onofrio 's weird girlfriend gretta scacchi an artist who ca n't ever finish anything there is also a movie within the movie which has to do with the making of a melodrama in which an innocent woman is about to be executed only to be rescued at the last minute by the altman 's theme has to do with the hollywood version of reality which is nothing more than what will earn big bucks it has nothing to do with truth '' a long list of hollywood stars make cameo appearances it 's really a movie very classy and hip altman also satirizes hollywood power players extremely well it 's a whole other world out there in lala land
i 've actually been hoping for a live cd release but i was more than happy with this dvd all the favorites are here only a minor gripe with the omission of echo and and the inclusion of priceless but that 's just personal preference this is all the evidence needed to show that this band has reached maturity drive is an unexpected change but being the most song in their lineup the obscurity is welcome the musical talent all around seems much improved from the previous dvds and each member gets to show off all their new tricks unlike some other bands incubus seems to perfectly display each musician 's talents so well with each song and this showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly every song is a highlight on this one my favorites are made for tv movie and sick sad little world other notes it 's the perfect place to film for a dvd we get to see brandon play guitar and how well ben works as a backup singer and i think jose could make any rock band sound good recommended for any fan of incubus especially of their newer material
when i first found the broadway lost treasure serier on amazon i nearly jumped up and down in my seat any broadway clips that i can get a hold of i definitly must get i bought broadway lost treasure i and broadway lost treasures ii together i must say the performances were very good just because you ca n't call broadway bad the way the performances were put together however was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic jerry orbach angela some of my favorite people but i wanted i little bit more background information on the shows and things like that overall i encourage purchasing broadway lost treasures ii and the first one if you keep an open mind if you dont know alot about broadway then this will bore you to tears this is not what you should purchase if you want to learn more about broadway if you are more interested in learning more about broadway rather than just seeing performances then i would buy broadway the american musical '' which can be found on amazon
i bought this as a dvd for home use i wo n't repeat the story as others have done so already i loved the story the plot was well put together and solid the acting was wonderful i have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time i see it i really am enjoying the fun of this film i 'd suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film it is made to be light with family values of what counts in life tim did an outstanding job as he always does the chasing scenes with tim on all fours becoming a dog the dog behaviors as a human had me rolling it is one of the funniest films i 've seen in a long time as an adult i loved it and would buy it again i 'm thrilled to see disney making such terrific and wonderful films it was tastefully done the caged scenes were carefully done no bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the disney films and no i did n't perceive this as a film geared toward small children perhaps and up would be my guess to demean the film based on the expectation that tiny children would appreciate the story is not realistic nor does it do justice for what the film is it is a wonderful film with a great storyline ! ! corinn
das boot is an epic film that is very well done i loved the suspense and terrific character moments the thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a nazi in the midst of the atlantic during 1941 wwii going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean the three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film this movie is now one of the top ten movies of all time for me in viewing the dvd i chose to turn on english subtitles while also selecting the english 2.0 spoken language what is interesting is how the english dub has paraphrased certain lines and in others totally changed every meaning behind the statements i 'm talking about the line that in german reads something like i ca n't wait to get back home and the out of a few wild ! '' is rewritten and dubbed as when i get home i 'm going to shower and sleep until december ! '' quite a drastic change but of course sailors in the german navy use language that i suppose is unacceptable even in an r '' rated movie for english audiences there are more than fifteen conversations of that nature that have been translated into english subtitles from the german language spoken in the original dub of the film while the english dub is totally different later in the film there are even lines shown in subtitles that are not spoken at all in the english dub very interesting and fun to watch even with the subtitles on i enjoyed this movie from start to finish i love the epic movies that run well over two and a half hours this one clocks in at a good four and a half hours ! it draws you in and keeps you going from the very first moment to the very last explosion one of the best war movies i have ever seen ! one of the most interesting ironies of this film is that the entire movie takes place within the nazi and we get to see and feel compassion for the german men who fight to keep the boat afloat the irony occurs when the allied forces attack them and we get to experience the other side of the equation very intense and dramatic
these are the best dvds out there for babies because they are full of live action animals people flowers water etc i got them for my daughter when she was about 3 months old she loved them then and she still loves them at 6 months they are perfect for the car for long trips to visit grandparents and for afternoons when i need a break to cook dinner she laughs at the kids on the video and loves the animals too the best part of course is the christian music ! these videos are top quality and my daughter loves them she gets bored very quickly with baby einstein

it is a gene kelly vehichle and there are three wartime buddies but that 's pretty much where the on the town '' similarities end it is a surprisingly sharp cynical story in which the protagonist 's dreams do initially come due to life circumstances betty comden and the late adolph responsible for so many great film scores as well as the scripts of auntie mame '' bells are ringing '' and what a way to '' contribute very witty songs here including the danubian sung by the guys and dolores gray 's thanks a lot but no thanks '' and music is better than words delivered with a rich smooth contralto '' i wish kelly and charisse had danced together the omission makes the film appear a bit empty but my favorite numbers are still his dance through the streets and her sexy dance with the boxers baby you knock me out '' and i would 've liked the finale better if it did n't have a big looming piece of the singin ' in the rain '' set in the background
it 's so silly how michael moore is criticized purely based on what trashy fox news watchers see on tv they claim that his works are fictious anti american jabble when in reality he encourages people to pirate the movie then goes on tour giving speeches full of well researched facts for free clearly this man is doing it all for the money if his words are so insincere why has the president not sued him for slander and why ca n't anyone slamming the movie ever make any specific reference it 's always a general statement about michael moore being one explictive or another and never about something he actually says could it be maybe that they do n't even know why they hate him
i really liked this movie and think is too underrated it has a great story line and plot although katie holmes has a small part it is a good one i really enjoyed this one has quite a few twists as well
maybe you had to be there maybe the actual film never quite measures up to what has been preserved in the memory of a certain generation and with literary roots in journalistic observations of the blandly benign cameron crowe maybe it lacks the nerve to truly explore the teenage sex blues with the farcical abandon of its vulgar cousin porky 's but even today fast times remains funny with witty set pieces and a host of emerging hollywood stars flirting dating and hooking up to the rock soundtrack of the period as burnout surfer jeff spicoli sean penn achieved legendary status yet special props go to judge reinhold as the dirty old senior any scene even remotely involving customer service he steals it then turns around and gives able dramatic support to jennifer jason leigh
it does tend to lurch but i give it a yes anyway because it says not so well something it is still arch heresy even to suggest the end is not near it is very very near and possibly it has already come and gone
i glad there is someone besides me that is fed up with the insufferable bores who automatically think a film is intellectual '' because it is made anywhere but the usa in their eyes america can do no right my other pet peave is the wide screen snobs and their utter distain for any film offered in full frame
samurai champloo has been a great series and this third dvd has kept that tradition though the last episode was weak as most recap episodes are the other three episodes made up for it and then some around the time this came out fans of the series were starting to buy the dvd 's more due to the shortage of episodes on adult swim as the last episode on this dvd is as far as adult swim would broadcast they did start to broadcast more shortly after dvd six below are my ratings for this dvd and it 's episodes episode nine beatbox this episode though not very good still has some funny scenes and some action mugen jin and fuu are caught trying to pass through a checkpoint with counterfiet passes the checkpoint officials find out that they did not make the forgeries and cut a deal mugen is sent to do one of their croked errands will mugen stay true to his companions watch and find out i rate this episode a simply because it lacked action and plot plus the man telling the story is looking back thirty years to when the episode occured i do n't know maybe it 's the thought of jin mugen and fuu being old but i do n't dig the old man looking that far back episode ten lethal one of my favorite if not my all time favorite sc episodes ! this episode kicks anus in every way possible ! i dont want to reveal to much of the story line but i reccomend watching this episode ! even if this dvd just had this episode and was still full price i would still buy it ! i rate this episode a or infinite if you really want stars it is though i find that underappreciating the episode to give it a finite rating episode eleven gamblers and jin falls in love with a depressed woman who has been forced to work in a to pay off her husbands debt still a good episode but not the best lots of great humor i rate this episode episode twelve the disorder recap episode jin and mugen read fuu 's diary while she takes a bath this episode has a lot of funny dialogue but that 's the only thing it has working for it i rate this episode well that 's it for this review check out my next review on volume four of samurai champloo i hope this review helped peace
peirce really suprised me in this movie he was always so pretty '' in his movies he showed that he can play dirty '' an unlikely friendship '' developes between a regular guy and a hired killer pierce the hired killer is getting older and less steady on the trigger could it be that years of murdering is weighing heavy on his concience or that he is close to his retirement years and dose n't have a real friend in this whole stinkin ' world because of the business he 's in either way he 's like a man in a desert who forgot to bring water unusual buddy film but it works ! enjoy
i could explain to you all about each show but you already know what makes this collection great is the fact as to how it is packaged along with the price you get 5 christmas tv classics in a collectors case along with a 20 song cd and for 25 bucks that is a deal you ca n't beat that 's roughly 5 bucks a show not including the cd i got this set just so my 5 year old can grow up watching some of the good '' christmas shows that i did
two years later the red sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in september thinking it never happened it was a utopian dream the comfort of the drugged and sleeping but it happen it 's here on film they could n't have made this all up and besides i remember it like it was yesterday the producers of this dvd did n't have much of a world series series to work with the sox swept the cardinals in four the real drama was the american league championship series still the producers have done a remarkable job of building the context of the curse of the bambino the tragedy snatched from the jaws of triumph in years that are branded into the thighs and brains of red sox fans 1967 1975 1986 the new spring hopes that make one feel a little foolish the mind games the despair the it all ended in 2004. it 's right here on film the names now fit comfortably beside those of yaz and the rest of fenway 's venerable ghosts schilling damon still beloved in pinstripes pedro millar derek lowe trot big papi manny being manny 'skip ' francona the undyingly heroic field captain 'tek ' varitek the man paid to steal one base dave roberts the gutsy trade of nomar then there were the demons of this passion play all the yankees but particularly who played the part of a bizarrely emasculated lucifer and all the yankees again and again everybody else was just there that season for bit parts and background noise for big papi 's walkoff homers and curt schillings epochal bloody sock the crux of red sox nation 's unlikely redemption a red sox fan watching this dvd for the fifth time can still not suppress the goosebumps where were we for this game and that game the true fans among us are slightly embarrassed about the fact that we remember where a stroke of intellectual capacity that is supposed to be reserved for truly international events as i write this in 2006 the sox are at home and detroit is facing off with oakland for the american league championship it does n't matter we won it 's right there on the dvd plus the soundtrack is brilliant it all ends in glory after all not ashes redemption
i 'm mildly into anime i only watch the stuff that i really enjoy this is the only series that has really drawn me in usually it 's just movies for me but wolf 's rain is amazing i ca n't wait for volume ii to be released on tuesday ! it contains the final episodes
this anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network and now is definetly considered a classic alongside cowboy bebop and others this is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people yoko kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect it 's so beautiful and fits the story so well the overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful as for the languages and region while i would n't know yet for this particular box set i would assume it is just like the individual dvds they put out with japanese and english language and english subtitles and i do n't know where to look for the region of the dvd but i think it might be region 1 whatever it means i do know that i have n't had any troubles playing it on any of our dvd players
this is a very emotional film it induces emotion in the viewer and for that i give it five stars i 'm more interested in constructive criticism than in praise so even though i think it is an excellent film i will just focus on what i think is wrong with it one problem is that blanche dubois is simply too pretty for the role we do n't understand on a gut level why this beautiful girl would worry about hiding behind dim lighting the script makes it clear that she is supposed to look old '' and yet she does n't that 's a fault of the film it makes her final passionate scene with karl malden incomprehensible he holds her up to the light she looks very pretty and yet we are supposed to believe that she looks terrible in bright light for that i blame the director elia kazan what in god 's name could he have been thinking of and why did he mess up so badly on that important detail another important fault of this film is that stanley kowalski 's attack on blanche is n't set up properly are we just supposed to believe that he is an animal and chalk it up to that sorry not good enough we should have seen it coming again another big by kazan when the script has the characters doing something that does n't ring true there 's a problem we needed to see that attack being led up to we needed to think oh my god i know what he is about to do '' stanley kowalski is actually the good guy throughout most of the movie all of a sudden it turns it 's incomprehensible somewhere between the writing directing and acting somebody dropped the ball somewhere the stanley kowalski who attacks blanche is not the same man who appears earlier in the film he 's not an animal '' he 's not set up that way for us blanche is the snob and stanley is okay but that is turned on its head at the end insanity is a nice little copout we can make our actors do anything and just say okay they went nuts very touching but not very realistic how does someone go insane what stages do they go through blanche 's descent into insanity into an inability to tell reality from fantasy should have been more realistic more researched more consistent with the way it actually happens it does happen to people people who are extremely bipolar people who are schizophrenic more research should have been done to show what the descent into insanity actually does look like i have high standards but that 's a good thing i think still i 've given this film five stars
i first saw this movie in high school in the theater i was extremely moved by the film and it triggered a facination with south asia that lasts to this day i even work half the year in sri lanka now so for me personally this movie is of tremendous influence i understand the arguements about the crediting of actors i always wondered why candice bergman is given top billing given that she only appears in a very few scenes well that 's the way of the world it 's marketing right or wrong and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known it 's not right but that 's hollywood i mean better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all yes and you 've got to admit it was quite a debut for ben kingsly wow he 'll be forever known for this role that aside this is an excellent amazing film of course it 's still highly relevant perhaps even more so in our world of fear the movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration a for anyone who feels anger fear agressively nationalistic hopelessness hatred or lost i can think of several politicans who need to see this movie
i did n't have high expectations for this movie but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times i 've always like tom cruise and he does n't disappoint in this movie but the real star is ken watanabe as the samurai perfect casting ! and koyuki as the samurai widow was just plain gorgeous the hd dvd transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better highly recommended
i think this is a beautiful story about a man who wanted to change his country he was not looking for his lost money he wanted a new hungary the story about a great man love through peace war and blood a great story from the hungarian history everyone who like dramas the century real heros have to see this wonderful movie
there have been emblematic films that plainly justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment but few times we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness constancy and dedication like this one we should be back to the times if silkwood or the china syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions on the other hand of the coin and i must confess i have never been a special fan of roberts she displayed by far the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the academy award that year one more thing in order to the fairness i would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance ellen burstyn and requiem for a dream '' and that i keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between barbara streisand and vanessa redgrave in 1967 where the difference in what acting concerns was even major excellent edition and magisterial direction of steven soderbergh
i saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre i thought it was going to be another run of the mill comedy that just happens to take place in a greasy fast food joint not even close ! this movie is strange and should someday earn cult status besides i like watching drew barrymore
you go diva ! ! i missed these videos soooo cool ! ! deeper than the night i think my favorite olivia song of so young so beautiful ! ! and even hotter now video gold 2 just as incredible rock on olivia !
their was a whole generation of little girls teenagers and young adults sitting down in the 90 's to watch 90210 and party of were even on the same night at one was a perfect tv night ! this show is you havent seen it your missing out and if you have you need to own this dvd ! i 'm really surpised that this dvd isnt more really think its because it hasnt been dvds need a little advertisements just to let the fans that dont search for it know its out it its worth every penn
on the face of it a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a attachment to an ancient woman seems about as niche '' as you can get but do n't overlook this film the relationship between harold and maude is truly endearing and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic through maude ruth gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit we get a truly unique perspective on life told in such a gracefully sweet way that we can not help but fall in love with her if you like igby goes down a modern interpretation of catcher in the rye you 'll get much the same feeling from harold and maude which is not so much a coming of age '' movie as a look at love in all its splendours
a friend with a three year old told us about this product and we purchased it wow ! our three year old girl kept wanting to watch it over and over we used the dvd along with us talking about numbers and she was doing great before started she was able to add and subtract numbers between 0 10
the stellar performances of jason alexander buzz and john glover make this movie providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film the swan lake scene while funny is probably the most sad as each character explains how he will pass on yet the most interesting character to me is gregory as he is the glue that holds this group of men together generously offering his victorian house for holiday vacations it is he who starts the film with his narration welcoming the viewer in as if we are a visitor to his home as well and having the final narration during the swan lake scene he is caretaker to his friends in life and in death and the central character that the six others revolve around it is befitting that he will be the last to go each character struggles with his own demons we are privy to their personal pain yet all manage to rise above their problems and find joy in life and with each other 's companionship even the most detestable character john is not entirely unsympathetic yes there 's some stereotypical moments but all in all this is an enjoyable film one that leaves an indelible impression
this movie is a great movie to add to your dvd collection especially if you are a mob fan this movie is about corruption within the mob about betrayal about death and dying it starts off with someone trying to whack the don and the family trying to find out who it is and why i 'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story just watch it mario puzo 's the last don 1997 was great too
i do n't own this series but i watch it on pbs it 's great they cover a limited number of words per episode and i 'm grateful it can get a little overwhelming my 2 year old daughter only does a few signs but she 's able to decipher anything i sign to her i know mama '' hungry '' want '' cookie '' for now that will have to do for mama is hungry she wants a cookie '' you 'll catch other words from the songs go to the signing time website they have sample videos and lyrics you 'll get the idea a little at a time is good enough for me expert proficiency is not my expectation here five stars
i love this series and plan to buy more it is well done the signs are separated so one can watch just one in a sitting or watch the whole dvd the word is first shown then a mom shows the sign then kids demonstrate including some use of the actual object if appropriate my child and i have both picked up signs quickly from this dvd
the bad sleep well '' is a forgotten gem from one of japan 's great masters akira kurosawa his other two shakespeare adaptations throne of blood '' macbeth and ran '' king lear are much more famous and justifiably so if you have seen them ran '' is particular is my favorite of all kurosawa films however this sharp and caustic adaptation of hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition it may be the most bleak subject matter that kurosawa ever tackled the corruption in the highest levels of government in japan the film begins with a long but funny wedding sequence that illustrates kurosawa 's great skill as a director we and the camera are among a group of reporters discussing the numerous convenient reasons for the marriage the bride is lame and the daughter of iwabuchi the head of corporation and the bridegroom nishi has aspirations to elevate his status in the business we see the comedy of manners play out in this sequence in increasingly humorous situations as the various parties deny these rumours and reporters comment to each other culminating in the panicked looks on the faces of the corporate as the wedding cake arrives in the shape of their office building public with a red x marking a spot in one of the windows where one of their former partners commited suicide it 's a virtuoso sequence that perfectly sets up the tone of the rest of the film the newspapers have a field day with this especially when various members of public are investigated for fraud and embezzlement yet they stoically remain silent and the case goes nowhere then it heats up again as a few of them commit suicide the rumours are that they were goaded into doing so n fact they were however without any substance to press the matter the case is dropped and that 's when the real story begins one of the public corp executives wada survives and is rescued by nishi and his shadowy accomplice itakura this is followed by a brilliant scene in which wada is taken to his own funeral and observes the farce all the while nishi plays him a tape with moriyama and shirai his former partners plotting his murder the way kurosawa stages this is masterful the sublime music emanating from the funeral is contrast dramatically with the words of public corp as wada listens on one of the ways wada contributes is to scare the living hell out of shirai wada poses as a ghost of himself in order to freak out shirai a pointed but clever method of tying in the ghost in hamlet as the plot progresses nishi reveals his reasons for saving wada and exacting a very personal revenge on iwabuchi and his cohorts the story 's pace becomes more frantic and exciting technically kurosawa is at his best here the wedding and the funeral are both marvels and they contrast each other perfectly he uses a lot of intriguing compostions for his interiors that serve to highlight his characters ' inner thoughts but very little movement of the camera in order to manipulate his audience the dark nature of the story is enough to suck you in one of the fascinating observations in the bad sleep well '' is that all of the characters are morally bankrupt and filled with secrets even nishi the protagonist his wife the ophelia character is the only one that kurosawa allows us to feel sympathy for and even then in the end she is not fully spared her grief taken in this context kurosawa 's hamlet becomes a study in the morality and pragmatism of revenge but also an incisive jab at the fat cats in modern japan if there is a flaw in the film it is that the overall pacing is not always brisk enough to sustain the long running time 2 hours the wedding despite being absolutely essential is protracted the rest of the film is much quicker but still drags in parts also kurosawa seems unsure about his ending the film ends quite abruptly but appropriately in terms of his larger point about the hopelesness of fighting the rampant corruption i would argue however despite these flaws overall the bad sleep well '' is a masterful and dark excursion into the seedy side of corporate crime using shakespeare hamlet brilliantly but not completely as it 's core toshiro mifune in particular gives one of his most unique performances instead of his usual fiery exterior we get a performance full of internalized anger throughout highly reccomended
the thomas crown affair '' gets better everytime i watch it i spot something i missed hear music which i heard but never listened to and see how it relates to the movie actually hearing the windmills of my mind '' this is an unbelievably good movie although i prefer the original 's ending
gosh the other reviewer who seems to me only watched the first four episodes of this series and judged the title soley on that oh and on the dvd covers this is n't the first anime to have 'fan service ' on the dvd covers look at kiddy grade an anime that this reccommends over tv i 'm not going to get into details on this anime for good reviews check out i 'm just saying i liked it and if you 're paitient and like a good mystery i hope you find this series just as enjoyable as i do
i ordered this guide so that i could understand all of the options and functions available on my new nikon since it is a video that i could watch pause then continue watching it was easy for me to understand the explanations made a lot of sense there are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the works but how to use the various functions to take better photos i highly reccommend it
jude is a very powerful film it is also very disturbing but it is absolutely a must see this is an adaptation of thomas hardy 's last novel the film is n't exactly like the novel but if you can ignore that then you 'll find that this is quite a terrific film just do n't expect exactly what you got from the novel over all i give it four stars
i waited years for this movie to be released in the united states as far as i was concerned it was n't about the acting as much as it was about the feeling '' the actors wanted to portray in which they profoundly accomplished i would recommend this movie to anyone who can reach that one step deeper into the minds of creativity and passion and appreciate the struggles of rising above and beyond the pain of broken dreams
murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a regular don juan '' to his neighbor winston a family man murrey gets talked into visiting 4 women whom he knew 20 years ago searching for a possible son whose existence is unclear and who may just be a hoax the visits are all shocking in different ways all women live in similar locations though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth all encounters are odd the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident she was number 5 in the list of suspects '' for the mother of the phantom son do n't watch this film if you need action or a plot if you are happy with smart dialogues odd situations great acting a script worked to perfection this is one for you
this is one of my favorite movies and i find it unfortunate that not too many people know about it i think it is important for people to know this story everyone should watch this movie simply because it is fantastic
the medium '' instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005. i usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal which tuned me in however it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating patricia arquette who was in ed wood '' with johnny depp plays alison dubois her emmy win for best actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry but the chemistry with jake weber who was in meet joe black '' and plays her husband joe is riveting they fight spat try to mask conflict in front of their kids juggle an impossible number of tasks and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of alison 's psychic ability i found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show i still wanted to watch them over episodes of csi miami that i had not seen when i bought the dvd i was hoping there might have been an episode i 'd missed but i 'd seen them all between nbc lifetime reruns several times i 'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing alison 's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together what impresses me about alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing in a world of violence it 's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points in the episode in sickness adultery '' her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her as she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife she finds that her best defense is the truth the two older daughters are also jewels maria lark as bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream mom please stop doing that ! '' sofia vassilieva as the older aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing david cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with arquette miguel sandoval as the district attorney manuel duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show perhaps we will sometime see more about his family while it 's hard to pick my favorite first season episode the complex plot of a priest a doctor medium walk into an execution chamber '' is a jewel with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder the dvd commentaries and introduction to the alison dubois really give excellent background for fans of the show this is one show that reaches the level of art for me its excellence will make it memorable for a long time this dvd collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection bravo
i was happy to see a 'romantic comedy ' that did n't line up with every other formula picture in the genre really fun stuff and some solid acting
this video is amazing ! my 6 week old son is watching it right now ! i ca n't believe how entertained he is by it ! these videos have been proven to increase a child 's iq so i do n't feel too guilty about letting him watch
while i 've always loved blade runner the theatrical cut '' was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation harrison ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped but hollywood in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience 's intelligence and artistic sensitivity stuck with it anyway on the assumption that we needed to be with sophomoric incompetence equally stupid though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted was the inappropriate sappy ending which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well it did n't even make any sense the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars but hollywood with characteristic cowardice trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience rick deckard 's fate at the end of the director 's cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982 and the subsequent vhs audience it reminds me of what orion pictures did to george romero 's monkeyshines since when does a romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots or how about the happy ending '' grotesquely grafted onto terry gilliam 's brazil the extra footage between deckard and rachael while not extensive enriches the characterizations however modestly and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end the only thing i regret is that the extra bloody footage in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes found on the old vhs tape was not included in the director 's cut which means that this is not fully the director 's cut the material was left out to garner the sacred almighty r '' rating upon the film 's as it was the first time around one would think it would have been restored on dvd but warner with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude decided against it they probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that ridley scott would have wanted it that way can anyone say eyes wide shut '' the fact that there are viewers course enough to value the theatrical cut '' and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all and definitive '' the director 's cut is despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again by anyone
this was an excellent experience my movies arrived very promptly and i have had the pleasure of watching them numerous times everything went well the dvd 's were still in their original wrapping and excellent condition ! i will definitely order from here again
i really like this video because of its time 30 minutes regular with 10 min bonus segment 40 min total and i like the instructor janice is really good calm cues well doesnt talk a lot and is not overly inspiring she clearly points out the person who will be doing impact moves and then continues on there is nothing complicated about the moves and they are very easy to learn no hard choreography either i use this a compliment of other videos and it continues to be one i enjoy to return to there are 3 segments each focusing on a different section core upper and lower body the bonus segment is a high segment combining all elements worth the time
an amazing film ! not only is it a fantastic adventure but the story is well laid out just the right amount of special effects great music and good actors when seeing this movie at the theater i was not too excited but when watching it a couple more times realized how awesome it really is not nearly as gory as gladiator but is similar in style 5 out of 5
i have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding robert kennedy and i 've got to say that this is by far one of the best pieces of work i 've yet to see the movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience 's attention allows for us to actually what robert kennedy is feeling to sense the tension during chaotic times and most importantly to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for america this movie is extremely provides excellent insight to the inner of robert kennedy and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from kennedy 's life if you are looking to pick one movie on robert kennedy this is it this is the one you want to watch after watching this you will see robert kennedy in a way you never have before
i just finished watching most of it and it 's not too bad the thing that most struck me is it does n't take very long to see which were the eras for superman that had the most influence on bryan singer he spent quite a bit of time explaining how hard it was for them to get superman started then we 're quickly through the comics and the kirk alyn eras then it slows down for a long retrospective of the george reeves years both in superman and the mole men and the adventures of superman then it blows through again through the comics and the animated series of the and then stops again for a lengthy study of superman the movie then briefly about superman ii superman iii superman iv the quest for peace and superboy then briefly on lois clark the new adventures of superman and superman the animated series and then we slow down again for a lengthy study of smallville and then it becomes a big commercial for superman returns or at least that 's how i perceived it singer 's got great respect for george reeves superman the movie and christopher reeve and smallville and that 's pretty much it most anything else he quickly blew through as if it were completely well except for his own movie but i expected that part produced by bryan singer and narrated by kevin spacey you 'd have to be pretty stupid not to realize that at least a chunk of it would be dedicated to selling the new movie i had to turn it off at that point not that i disliked superman returns but as soon as kevin spacey said how the actors in superman returns were perfect '' for their roles and then began discussing kate bosworth as lois lane i started getting nausiated i will give credit they were remarkably honest with their assessments of the various projects i loved it when annette o'toole a fan of the character who played lana lang in superman iii and martha kent on smallville expresses shock that there was actually a superman iv there was a superman iv ! i never saw that one ! '' she did n't miss much i thought it was refreshing that though they never got nasty about stuff if a movie was a disappointment or a comic storyline flopped they pretty much admitted it and i liked that ilya salkind was willing to take some of the blame for the bad blood that happened behind the scenes of superman the movie and superman ii it reflected well on him that he did n't just blame richard donner as he might have been apt to do while they were doing their fighting back in the day but i do think it needed more balance we did n't need to spend quite so much time watching clips of george reeves or of seeing christopher reeve with his sweat stains those moments and the stuff from smallville could have been trimmed down nicely to give more time to other elements perhaps more of the animated league unlimited era or to lois and clark there were also some moments where they went back to talking about the comics even though it was periods where nothing significant was happening in the comics as if someone said hey we have n't acknoweledged that the comics are still in production at this point we should say something thus too making the whole thing feel dry and unbalanced btw i recognized a comic from my own personal collection ! there 's a shot at one moment where the ground is scorched into the s '' symbol then a hand comes up out of the dirt and then clark appears and walks off i have that comic it 's an alternate storyline issue the first time they kill off superman and in the same issue superman and lois wed and this was all long before doomsday it 's actually a very cool story
saw the names kathy bates barry manilow and julie andrews so had to give it a view best film ever best lines in a film ever as well julie andrews is in the cockpit '' thank god '' that alone has enriched my life beyond measure
only the timidity of the studios could explain how this movie landed on the shelves without even a mention it 's up to word of mouth to save it and it 's certainly worth saving nobody does the awakening matron '' like kathy bates see fried green tomatoes '' and her grace beasley is a delight as she finds her backbone and her voice she needs it her meredith eaton is an dwarf with no inhibitions and dan ackroyd is the wettest blanket this side of the johnstown flood after being dumped by her husband patronized by her son and deprived of her grandson grace has no choice but to look after herself grace goes to england to attend the funeral of her idol jonathan pryce in fine voice and having the time of his life and meets his gay lover rupert everett after swallowing her shock the unlikely pair returns to chicago to track down pryce 's murderer the performances are all fine the pace is feathery the music easy on the ear it 's all whimsical and preposterous and the kind of movie that will have you laughing out loud when you 're sitting home alone the ultimate test of a comedy unconditional love '' passes the test enjoy it and spread the word
i love this video i get up before anyone else so that i can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long it 's a fantastic meditation though that centers me for the entire day ravi singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear ana brett does the poses very clearly and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses i have already recommended this video to friends
this dvd is a must have for anyone interested in beginning kundalini yoga the moves flow into each other easily and you can go at your own pace this dvd has everything meditation relaxation mantras stretching wonderful music beautifully narrated and professionally presented highly recommended ! ! !
office space '' is a very funny comedy many parts of the film were a delight in the beginning when everyone is stalled in traffic i knew the feeling working at initech corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of peter gibbons ron livingston besides having a job he hates he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is then there is his boss lumbergh an arrogant jerk life for peter gibbons is just one boring day after another that is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion and demands of his then girlfriend while undergoing hypnotic suggestion the psychologist dies of a but peter is now a changed man he no longer cares about his job and says whatever 's on his mind and his boss lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new peter when peter learns of the impending layoff courtesy of john mcginley and his partner at initech corporation he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus his two fellow and friends are only too happy to go along afterall they 're part of the layoff 's and on top of that the company men want to make peter a supervisor this film is funny on many levels with jennifer anniston as the love interest of peter and the character actors that make up the film it makes for an enjoyable watch jennifer anniston 's character and her dealings with her boss and his flairs '' are also funny this is a highly recommended comedy i 'm sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between peter and his boss lumbergh and the character of his boss lumbergh is delightfully hilarious especially the way he talks the whole movie is very funny and wonderful highly recommended
stars listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly with blank stares where is the horror in that sounds like a typical sunday afternoon at the mall to me in fact dawn of the dead 1978 really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film more or less picking up where night of the living dead '' left off zombies are on the hunt for prey across pennsylvania four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies they take refuge in a shopping mall which provides just about everything they need they work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure the walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and do n't bring much in the way of strategy it would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they were n't so tenacious the four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the tv of bombing areas of high zombie concentration they have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere what does fate have in store for them the night of the living dead '' took place obviously at night and in the dark which provided a much more frightening backdrop it was also in black and white which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie this is not the case with dawn of the dead '' which is in color and takes place during daylight the zombies '' are people dressed as they normally would but with their faces painted grey the result is anything but scary tom savini 's effects are hit and miss though always disgusting nonetheless this is a decent film that features some acting and a decent script the anchor bay divimax dvd is also noteworthy with a clean transfer and dts sound mix an extra star for the effort
kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular bloodsport '' and like bloodsport kickboxer is no doubt a van damme classic '' there are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences however the acting suffers worse than bloodsport in that department as for the plot revenge go figure but we do n't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie hey it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action fortunately kickboxer delivers it well the movie begins with a couple of good fights right away about of the movie is training sequences but many are enjoyable to watch the final fight is between the villain tong po played by michel qissi and kurt sloane van damme its a rather lenghty fight about 10 minutes which is nice above all else they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on and yes the result is some blood during the fighting kickboxer is the only martial art movie i know of that used this ancient thai style of fighting '' with the exception of kickboxer 2 and a small scene in ring of fire i really enjoyed this i also enjoyed michel qissi he had maybe one line in the movie but still succeeded in making tong po a great villain who also will return in the sequal lastly we ca n't forget to mention the van damme dance napoleon dynamite would be proud also keep an eye out for ong soon han main villain in both bloodsport 2 and dragon the bruce lee story who has a short fight against tong po about way through the movie
i have trouble saying how much i enjoyed this movie the plot was well worn but it did n't feel staid or plodding visually the movie is simply stunning absolutely some of the best visuals i have seen in years the jim henson company outdid themselves this time
maybe you 've heard that it 's all been done before '' gaiman and mckean prove that wrong with this unique movie it really is something new mckean has worked for years in the comic industry defining a visual style that works at a visceral level the style has many ways to look depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy some times mckean 's work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone other times it 's a of some horrible fear trying to waken disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience i never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life well i was wrong this movie 's imagery defies easy description i can only invite you to see it for yourself and to experience a movie that is truly like no other the video makes me regret missingn the theater experience the sound track generally works well too from the surreal drone of bagwell 's victrola to the nightmare chant of the during helena 's transformation i 'm not normally one to notice but mirrormask 's music complements its look flawlessly you did n't come here for the story light and dark in conflict lost mystic artifact plucky youth untrustworthy the acting does n't distinguish itself either despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes stephanie leonidas does a good job in the helena role with a convincing mix if you liked the acting in the original who series this will rise to your highest expectations the story is n't the strength here you 'll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy
i 'm another of those who saw this at sundance and all the things i enjoy about gaiman and mckean 's graphic novels were on display the quiet humor the intelligence the delightful weirdness the astounding visual vocabulary except that in this case the words are spoken by good actors and all those visuals get up off their feet and move it 's hard to describe the impact of watching a mckean painting move and talk there might be those who quibble about the movie looking too animated '' but of course that 's exactly the point to create a world and make it dance the end result visually at least is like nothing you 've ever seen before and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone some of the people i talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull that they had seen it all before well it 's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve a little alice in wonderland '' here a little time bandits '' there a lot of wizard of oz '' over here not to mention a resemblance to gaiman 's own coraline '' but i 'm just as familiar with those stories as anyone else and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of mirrorrmask '' after all it 's what you do with a story that determines its success and from moment to moment there was enough innovation and cleverness enough delight and wonder to make the movie a positive delight when the movie came out in theaters i went to see it again and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog then a friend of mine tried to show the dvd to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the hey in wizard of oz '' the moment when the witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me yet it lingered in memory and when i got older i was drawn back and fell in love with the movie that 's how this stuff works mirrormask '' was probably a little too wild to be a commercial success but i bet it 's going to have a long long shelf life on dvd as people pull it out to tell their friends wait till you see this
i loved this movie it was very touching and projected a wonderful image it was a rare find
excelente concierto en el castillo slane en irlanda bono se entrega a su publico buen sonido buenas imagenes magnificos extras lo recomiendo dos horas de u
my hat 's off to sean penn for having the nerve to take this role and then really committing to the role he committed way too much though his performance is so over the top he would have qualified for the pole vault in the sydney olympics merely by forwarding a copy of this dvd to the judges dakota fanning is as precious as ever and i hope she can avoid all the trappings of child stardom that have sapped some of the best child actors of the last 30 years todd bridges jill whelan eve plumb i was not put off by all the commercial and know that making a movie has a lot of expenses
i am sam is superb to the core excellent performances across the board and an emotionally involving story sean penn is believable as someone who is mentally challenged this is a veritable tour de force for him but not to be upstaged is dakota fanning who plays opposite of penn and is named lucy diamond after the hit beatles song sean penn 's character has to fight for custody of lucy and luckily he retains the services of a good lawyer played by michelle pfeiffer for free she helps him as best she can and so do some mentally challenged friends and a caring neighbor all in all a very beautiful movie with plenty of heart and goodness one of my favorites
this as you may have already read was a very intimate little show made to promote morning view the live footage is as good as it gets and the sound is flawless to boot this dvd really gives you a good idea at how amazing incubus is live most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers every song is a favorite of mine and i absolutely love the way brandon mixed things up on pardon me plus the little comments brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch i still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that i never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet the bonus features are splendid as well if you watched everything this dvd has to offer it would take up about of your day probably there 's that much on here just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs brandon recording warning a lot of this song is a capella and incubus showing how funny they really are the original cut of the wish you were here video is also on this which is pretty humerous a few of the best songs on here are pardon me the warmth warning new skin and nice to know you as amazing and funny as the special features are the standout is really the performance i ca n't find any words that would do this show justice i guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself
this is without a doubt the dvd to own if you wan na see how 5.1 should sound and how digital video should look if you own an hd tv and have a 5.1 system you must have this the crowd has been minimalized whoever directed this did a fantastic job you get to see a little of what every member is doing throughout a song incubus mixes up the set list a lil too putting some old favorites in there glass sounds great this is the best concert dvd out right no
i have read many reviews of this movie and got tired of the stupid reasons many people have to complain about this movie most comments are so ridiculous that you can easily tell they might have a deeper reason why to destroy this movie even though they know is good well i hope this comments are read by the right people who are not brainless as many others the movie was full packed with action the 2 's attacking the man in the car is just one of the many great scenes the stegosaurus attack was so good the raptors scenes kept me attached to my seat scenes on the cliff were so good dinosours loosed all over the island was very intense on the san diego one of the favorite sequences for many people my favorite sequences were on the island though the movie is intense and full of action excellent sequel if not better maybe some people have not noticed but on this page you can find that the movie was a total success on the whole world whether you like it or not it made 614 millions world wide on the other side the movie was nominate for oscar best effects visual effects saturn award best director steven spielberg best fantasy film best performance by a younger vanessa lee chester best special effects best supporting actor pete postlethwaite blockbuster entertainment award favorite actor jeff goldblum favorite actress julianne moore grammy awards best instrumental composition written for a motion picture or for television between many others 3 wons after this is said i 'm very sure spielberg is very satisfied with the results of this sequel and you know why because the movie was made to entertain and satisfy all dinosaurs lovers out there and it did the is just forgetting once again how to watch a movie get disconnected from first parts and watch the sequel as if it was a total new movie and value it for what it is and not for was is supposed to be better than the first part sequels are not made to overpass the success of the first part they 're made to give you more of what they know for sure you enjoy on the original movie but because of the time issue was not included on the first one go get them all 3 and watch all as if it was just one movie and then think if is really bad i know for sure that millions of people who saw the movie around the world thought the same i did excellent movie ! ! ! !
hello vietnam and greetings ! says bruno kirby as steven hauk in one scene of this film it was this scene where he filled in for radio personality adrian cronauer robin williams who was on reportedly on special assignment adrian arrives in vietnam from america via aircraft at first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the vietnam radio airwaves but they discover that adrian 's brand of humor is outrageous very much like howard stern in real life they also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing hey this was set in 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with the beatles and the rolling stones from the united kingdom when adrian and hauk first met the lieutenant told adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself when the lieutenant first heard adrian on the air the lieutenant was not pleased at all with adrian 's stint you oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music ' not wild stuff '' hauk told adrian in a meeting the 'normal modes of music ' refer to easy listening artists like andy williams perry como mantovani jim nabors lawrence welk frank sinatra and percy faith would bob dylan be out of line adrian asks hauk and the lieutenant replies '' way way way out of line ! '' adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in vietnam and they hoped that adrian would permanently do his morning show there the brass decides to suspend adrian bringing heartbreak to fans when hauk did his stint many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted adrian back on the air one listener said in a letter '' captain hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man 's balls '' another wrote to hauk '' you suck eat a bag of s t ! '' so adrian is back on the air but not for long because sgt dickerson the late walsh the top man of the brass demanded that adrian be cancelled sgt dickerson 's superior loves adrian and even demanded his reinstatement sgt dickerson is transferred to guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant 's abusive attitude the title of this film is how adrian began his morning show on the very last show done by adrian 's friend ed garlick forrest whittaker ed began the show saying '' good morning vietnam '' just like adrian ed tells listeners about adrian 's departure from vietnam we hear adrian saying '' goodbye vietnam '' in a message adrian also left vietnam because of his association with a criminal who 's the brother of a vietnamese woman adrian befriended other funny scenes include adrian teaching the vietnamese how to use profanity adrian doing a parody of the late richard nixon on the air and adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield this film was a megahit for both williams and director barry levinson they were both at least nominated for academy awards levinson did win a best director oscar for his next film rain man this film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like three men and a baby both films were made by touchstone pictures a division of buena vista pictures three men and a baby was a megahit as well both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. three men and a baby inspired a sequel why did n't gmv obviously nobody had any ideas not even mitch markowitz who composed the screenplay
i remember seeing this film when i was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling i did n't know what the name of this movie was and i was looking for it in the video stores i stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that i saw 20 years ago i bought it after seeing it again this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago though by today 's standards this movie is rather cheap and cheesy it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling this movie is original having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings that eats people like birds eat worms this movie is a hybrid of godzilla and slasher flicks this is definately material but it 's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories and that is worth more than the price of admission
i bought this for my husband because i knew he liked seven samurai he was delighted with the gift and i was surprised to find that i really like these movies too they are entertaining and insightful and a pleasure to watch

what a splendid teacher is this ! a soothing captivating movie the students are most endearing i found it interesting that in the special features interview with the guy who made this movie he refers to the teacher as the teacher '' and not by his name georges lopes this moviemaker appears to be of the opinion that there are a lot of teachers who could have filled this role as well or nearly as well well let me tell you he is wrong this teacher is special there are not very many teachers as patient and diplomatic and considerate on this entire planet as georges lopez
i really bought this dvd on a whim there is no question why this production won an emmy one voice '' the very last song in the concert is worth the price of dvd seriously stunning
if you love manilow you will enjoy this dvd of a great entertainer all the old hits plus many new dvd is almost like being there
tim burton 's ed wood '' a surreal is one of the most entertaining inspiring and funny i 've seen no wonder really since it 's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best writers scott alexander larry karaszewski who after this film would pen the larry flynt the people larry flynt '' and the andy kaufman man on the moon '' it 's also got an amazing cast of actors including oscar nominee johnny depp best actor 'finding neverland ' oscar winner martin landau best supporting actor 'ed wood ' sarah jessica parker 'failure to launch ' patricia arquette 'true romance ' jeffrey jones 'deadwood ' and oscar nominee bill murray best actor 'lost in translation ' depp plays edward wood an aspiring filmmaker who 's down on his luck and lives with his girlfriend dolores fuller parker after hearing about a film being made about a transsexual without a script ed pens a script called glen or glenda '' the movie is kind of close to ed 's heart because ed likes to dress in woman 's clothes but he 's not gay while walking past a shop that sells coffins ed meets the actor bela lugosi landau who played dracula in the classic universal film and recruits him to star in the glen or glenda film the movie immediately bombs and is called one of the worst films ever made not letting it get him down ed goes to work on his next film bride of the atom '' after a few more films and meeting a few new people including wrestler tor johnson george the animal '' steele tv personality vampira lisa marie and psychic criswell jones ed goes on to make his masterpiece plan 9 from outer space '' the latter is the only film i 've ever seen by ed wood while the movie has been called the worst film ever made it was n't bad it 's campy and stupid you can definitely see why it would be considered bad back then but it was entertaining and fun to watch ed wood was an interesting and quirky guy which tim burton makes perfectly clear here and depp does a great job bringing wood to life martin landau gives his finest performance as bela lugosi he disappears behind the persona he looks and sounds like lugosi another thing i liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in ed wood 's life through his first film to his masterpiece '' we hear the downside of his life through the epilogue this movie is in the end a loving tribute to b '' movies that is yet perfect as i said the movie is very funny especially landau who gets some of the best lines as lugosi bill murray as ed 's transsexual friend bunny grade
what can i say '' the humbler '' says it all just watch him play looks easy ya say i 've been playing now for 30 years still wish i could play like that ! ! very down to earth '' video reveals quite alot of ideas and licks have fu
this movie sounded stupid when i first heard about it who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense obviously ice cube could this movie stars lisaraye in her film debut as diana who is known to the stripping world as diamond a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school while working at a shoe store she meets trixie adele givens and ronnie chrystale wilson they convince her into quitting her job and working at the player 's club a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named dollar bill bernie mac when diana 's cousin ebony monica calhoun comes into town she tells diana that she wants to work at the player 's club ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of using what you 've got to get what you want '' this movie is a thrill ride and the fight scene towards the end is the best part of the movie featured in the movie are jamix foxx johnson and john amos the plot is perfect and the script is well written this movie has to be one of my favorite
i do n't think so be it in the jungle a new york high rise or at sea hepburn tracy were great no argument but they were so modern urbane not rowdy sexy always fighting like harlow gable china seas is a fine example of this chemistry yeah its a pretty good story too gable is capt gaskell skipper of a ship running from hong kong to singapore harlow is the floozie dolly he had a fling with on shore the ship is carrying gold there is a terrific typhoon a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while they torture the captain but he does n't reveal where the gold is dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman wallace berry against the captain because she is mad at him she of course changes her mind the captain is trying to ditch dolly thinks he 's meant for lady sybil played by rosalind russell an old flame but he dolly really are in love unfortunately the collaborations between harlow gable was cut short at five movies with harlow untimely early death several years later
let me clear this up you are a true exercise fanatic this dvd is for you i 've done every dvd exercise program including taebo and this ranks in my top 2. taebo is awesome for the cardio but when it comes down to muscle tone this dvd is tops the background music and background exercise people are the least of my worries you have to concentrate on the exercises she does to tone your body ! ! ! these exercises are an all over workout my favorite part is the 20 minute arm workout my arms never looked so good ! ! she works the hell out of you and it took me a few times to get through it but if you want to tone up and get in shape just put in this dvd and be prepared to sweat ! ! !

i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister over and over again laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head or when she accidently dyed her hair green or when she waxes poetic about her bosom friend '' it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old it is a beautiful heartwarming movie with gorgeous scenery unforgettable characters and plenty of moments to laugh and cry
it 's a ritual for my 5 year ld daughter and her dad to watch samurai jack before bed back when she was 3 and it was played on cartoon network they made sure to watch it together now that cartoon network is retarded and they do n't play it anymore i 've bought seasons 1 and 2. i just wish it was played on cartoon network like it used to be jill henrichse
marc singer is a bloke from england who moved to new york city saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets and became friends with them they in turn trusted him accepted him as one of their own and showed him their secret living quarters deep underground in abandoned train tunnels the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets intelligent and resourceful they had hooked up to free electricity and had working tv 's and stoves what makes this documentary five stars instead of four is the making of documentary only there do you learn that the movie crew were the tunnel folks only there do you learn how singer made this movie with no money equipment or knowledge of filmmaking this movie took six years from start to finish unfortunately it was not the financial success its producers hoped for but it resonates unbelievably the deleted scenes are not to be missed although some are much better than others the one where a man talks about how his cousin killed a cat for food and the scene where two young men talk in detail about recent sexual activities lent nothing to the film
another reviewer has said that 5 stars are not enough for this film i 'll second that opinion if you have seen the remake with michael douglas pretend you have n't and watch the way it should be done if you 've seen neither version of the film get this one and get ready for anything this is above all a classically sarcastic farce between two misfits who have amazing chemistry together both peter falk and alan arkin are marvelous craftsmen and their combination of silliness and genuine rolicking humor is blended in an almost pace from beginning to end again as i 've said in other of my reviews minor characters are important ed begley as the cia boss adds weight and color to that aspect of the plot and richard libertini as the south american dictator i 've never seen him play a sane character adds another kind of raucous fun this is a comedy for anyone who appreciates true comedy and if you meet anybody who has seen the film just scream surpentine ! surpentine ! '' and watch them fall apart
this comedy starring martin short and kurt russell is pretty funny when i first watched it i was n't really impressed with it but now i find it pretty funny i think that kurt russell as captain ron was pretty funny however it was the antics of martin short who hires captain ron to sail his ship in the caribbean that was the funniest character in the film the story begins when a relative of short dies leaving him a ship which is moored at a small caribbean island the wife mary kay place who is not too pleased at going to the island decides to go along with this crises of short on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat enter captain ron kurt russell he is a very strange and quirky fellow to the uptight and anxious martin short however since short knows nearly nothing about boating he decides to hire captain ron on the suggestion and recommendation of the man who is interested in buying the boat therefore captain ron who is not very bright to begin with leads the family including short 's two children on a cruise through the caribbean and he is a very eccentric character harmless but funny what ensues is a funny interaction between short and russell on their voyage including a scene where russell warns short not to stray from one particular islands path due to guerilla 's on the island which short interpets as gorilla 's a very funny scene recommended it is a family watch that your children can enjoy

is it a bad thing to see a movie and deem it good by standards different from which you would judge other movies let me explain broken hearts club is a good movie a little corny and certainly more than a little predictable it does n't really do anything new but for a gay film it breaks all the rules breeder hunks play femme gay men there is no one with aids in the whole story there are butch gay men in this movie and no none of the gay men has a best friend who is a single white straight female can you handle it the movie is entertaining the plot is sweet the best part of the film is the style in which it is broken up ala ' the television show frasier the movie is split into sections by definitions flashed on screen to help explain the next scene the best definition has to do with 'meanwhile ' 'meanwhile ' being the gay term to tell your friend when an attractive male walks by and the movie itself is filled with 'meanwhiles ' dean cain looks especially nice in this film and pulls off the character of a pretty boy with ease go figure john frasier leaves his comfortable role of an on frasier to be the of this group of friends and the coach of their softball team andrew keegan is the newbie of the recently outed gay man finally kerr smith who has been playing a gay character on dawson 's creek for some time play the token gay character on a softball team of macho fireman

awesome college movie my only regret is that i did not see this movie during my college years alas they have the dvd now ! yay !
based on the cliffhangers he used to watch in theaters george lucas created something special a of the entire adventure genre these films waited a long time to make their bow on dvd much too long for myself personally i always loved these films they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time each of the three films is very different from the others raiders of the lost ark '' the first and best of the three introduces us to indiana jones perhaps lucas 's greatest creation premiering in 1981 this film was a smash also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture also starring was karen allen perhaps the most female for harrisan ford it seemed she could give as good she got and never backed down in any scene second was the temple of doom '' easily the darkest of the three and the most intensely exciting this film is a thrill ride from start to finish and does n't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor the third film the last crusade '' is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor and has the wonderful sean connery to steal every scene he 's in the interaction between indy and jones is wonderful if anyone was to ever play indiana jones ' father it was sean connery the forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves these films waited far too long to be released to dvd and i lay the blame squarely on george lucas i 've heard he really did n't think dvd would take off like it did that it was just a phase it 's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy as with his star wars '' trilogy the indiana jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all dvd collections
i saw this on pbs ' great performances this documentary is about film genius akira kurosawa the documentary charts akira kurosawa 's early life in japan to the end of his life kurosawa brought japanese cinema to a world wide audience i recommend this dvd for anyone who is a akira kurosawa fan plus the dvd has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the pbs program and kurosawa filmography
dietrich bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey his books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues but practical issues of the greatest moment there is a great line in kierkegaard in the preface to the sickness unto death where he writes everything essentially christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed even if only medical experts understand it it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person '' what gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them as he struggled to live out the implications of christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so bonhoeffer was in so many ways a paradox and the documentary does a great job of showing this raised in a secular home he inexplicably decided to become a theologian and pastor at a time when a host of right wing movements were overtaking germany he espoused left wing political and social values in an age of growing intolerance he expressed a sympathy and understanding of both jews and blacks almost unprecedented in the germany of his time and in an age when many theologians wrote academic works with little regard to how they should connect with real life bonhoeffer was obsessed with the connections between thought and practice what is most impressive in studying the life of bonhoeffer whether through reading his books or eberhard bethge 's great biography or watching this documentary is the man 's fundamental goodness and dedication to doing what is right if he had been catholic instead of protestant he would surely by now have been declared a saint he seems to have had the saint 's calmness and peacefulness one is certain that he slept the sleep of the just bonhoeffer was one of the most promising young theologians in weimar germany had he lived in more peaceful times he certainly would have written a host of theological works like his theological mentor the great karl barth who was himself the greatest theologian between luther and calvin and the present he would have written works that explored the concrete role that religion must play in every day life when hitler rose to power bonhoeffer could easily have fled to the united states and taught through the course of the conflict and in fact had an appointment at union theological seminary in new york which he left to return to germany moreover he joined the resistance against hitler and came to believe that it was his moral and religious duty to aid in the attempt to assassinate him after an attempt to kill hitler through the use of an air pressure bomb placed on a plane failed for whatever reason it did not detonate as it should have a host of suspected conspirators were arrested including bonhoeffer he spent the rest of his life in a nazi prison dying at the hands of the nazis only a few days before the american armies liberated the concentration camp to which he was transferred near the end if one reads his ethics one is impressed by sections such as the one on what it means to tell the truth kant had famously argued that if a man that one suspects is angry enough to kill a particular person comes up and asks you where that person is the moral law demands that you not lie to the murderer though in kant 's defense it is n't clear that we are obligated to tell him where the intended victim is but merely that we not lie for bonhoeffer the situation is so much more complex he knew about many facets of the conspiracy and merely refusing to answer the gestapo 's questions would have done much to confirm the existence of the conspiracy bonhoeffer was forced to systematically fabricate a tissue of lies that would mislead the nazis as much as he could while protecting as many people as he could this lends a sense of poignancy to his writing on what it means to tell the truth that is almost unbearable reading between the lines one realizes that bonhoeffer realized contra kant that telling the truth '' might actually entail lying to the best of one 's abilities i had only one tiny complaint with the documentary i love klaus maria brandauer as an actor he is a powerful and subtle performer but his voice on the dvd is very hard to understand i do n't know if his accent is too thick or if the recording has too much bass to be clear i found i could understand only a portion of what he was saying anyone who is moved by this documentary should certainly look further into bonhoeffer 's life and thought i once was privileged to be part of a group of thirty or so students who had a long conversation with eberhard bethge about bonhoeffer bethge features prominently in the film there is no question that if you were to read only one book on bonhoeffer his magisterial biography is the place to go it is massive but it is unquestionably worth the effort i love bonhoeffer 's ethics but it might be a tad too academic for the lay reader the cost of discipleship in which he makes his famous distinction between cheap grace and costly grace is a wonderful book and can easily be read by someone without a strong theological background letters and papers from prison which collects things written from the time of his arrest to the end of his life is justly celebrated as a classic religious work a testament to freedom the essential writings of dietrich bonhoeffer is a very fine anthology that collects writings from every period of his life i recommend this film as strongly as possible to me bonhoeffer is one of the truly great christian heroes of the past century though his courage and sacrifice offers equal inspiration to as well
bonhoeffer was a very informative very interesting video i first decided to watch it at the urge of my pastor i watched the portion that pbs showed and i wanted to see more so i bought the dvd i am glad that i did
love this dvd i loved the live performance at the mtv awards she has my vote
on hearing that warner bros was to issue a set of busby berkeley films i ensured my dvd player was rendered and then i waited it was a dream finally come true having been entranced by berkeley 's films since childhood i could hardly wait for the box to arrive oh joy ! the quality of the dvds is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed if some of these extras are not to one 's taste then fair enough but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature it is a shame that the al jolson number was removed from the compilation disc because it was not intended to be racially offensive when it was produced but today 's political correctness lobby inevitably takes its toll that said we are left with a plethora of magnificence from busby berkeley which gladdens the heart and which left me euphoric because the quality of the release exceeded my expectations thank you warner bros for the tlc you have lavished on this set and you dear reader if you have not experienced the work of this great director before i urge you please please consider buying it i can guarantee you will not be disappointed this was hollywood 's golden age so now you have the chance to experience it please do n't miss out
this is a great video collection of her past videos i love it from the sweet 'i wan na love you forever ' to the record label controlled image of 'irrisistible ' and 'a little bit ' i love the 'a little bit ' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop but overall this dvd is awesome i like the footage from the dream chaser tour and the biography stuff this is the best dvd before jennifer lopez 's the reel me
look at my review for the movie soundtrack i had a full vinyl copy of the voiced movie but my mom sold it i hate that fact but there is n't a thing i can do about it i wish i could get one back
this is the kind of movie i used to enjoy seeing a couple of times a year and now see oh about once every 10 years or so an incredibly interesting odd provocative movie that does n't insult its audience the acting is phenomenal the script is really interesting and the characters are not people you 've seen 1000 times before although it 's sort of about baseball it 's not a baseball movie it 's a pity that so few people want to see interesting movies like this i loved this movie
videodriome is a movie i 've been a fan of for years i use the movie as a test to see if people are real movie and horror fans and not just posers the best part of the film is that any day now fox will greenlight a reality tv show where are killed in front of a live studio audience if you 're new to the work of david check this out asap and see what all the fuss is about the criterion dvd is stacked with extras and the transfer is a thing of beauty
yes i thought the whoppi disclaimers were absurd how many generations have grown up with these cartoons and now all of a sudden they 're bad '' i never saw disclaimers on cbs when i watched these cartoons on saturday mornings for years and years ! ! ! but aside from that my main gripe is the organization it would be better if they 'd organize these into eras i 'm not as big on the leon schlesenger era from the as i am on the and would rather these be organized chronologically not that i do n't respect those early shorts for what they were i just like the later ones better regardless as long as they keep releasing these i 'll still keep getting them since cartoon network and nickelodean have completely removed them and decided that the new generation of kids do n't have the attention span '' to appreciate them i beg to differ my kids love looney tunes ! and replace them with garbage full of toilet humor which apparently is ok by the pc police
i grew up in hannibal mo so i am very familiar with mark twain 's writing and his humor the make up is great as holbrook even looks like twain holbrook is a great story teller and he uses the material well and makes it wa wonderful program i saw a perfomance live in nyc years ago and another one in my current home town each time i see it again it is still funny and a great performance
visconti 's film is significantly different from mann 's classic story aside from the obvious changes aschenbach being a composer instead of a writer etc there are many subtle touches that deepen the ambiguity of the character for example in the book aschenbach 's wife is dead and his daughter is grown up and married away in the film his daughter dies in childhood and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits venice another reviewer here called the film ambient '' i would add the word poised '' the camera lingers on scenes for many minutes observations occur in planes of depth the acting is often extremely subtle the young man who plays tadzio looks as if he is sculpted of alabaster compositions lighting settings costumes and makeup are simply exquisite imagine if this had been photographed in ! death in venice probably looks better here than it ever did in theaters the dvd transfer is superb based on what appears to be a spotless pristine source the wide panavision aspect ratio is faithfully preserved anamorphically enhanced for tvs sadly the original monaural soundtrack has not been remixed for stereo but execept for some occasionally muffled dialog which may be intentional it still sounds very good the generation will find this film tough going do n't buy this if you 're hoping to see police gondolas flip over and explode
i first viewed this film with a friend in my home he and i are both lovers of beautiful music and art this film satisfies both categories the score is absolutely magnificent and the views of venice beautiful the acting by main character dirk bogard is subtle but effective we found this film to be a totally experience
excellent little known movie with viggo mortensen as an agent under deep cover to infiltrate japenese mob great performances by all michael nouri a little over the top great action and sentimentality when viggos character is torn between man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent after makes deal with mobster nouri to make a hit on the yakuza
liam neeson was wonderful to watch a tragic love story with great winter scenery and lots of cold breath shots however patricia arquette was too teenage giggly not a terrific actress in this film at least still a great role for neeson
one of the best movies i 've seen in ages ! ! ! most movies put me to sleep i stayed awake the entire time action suspense great flick !
upon watching the movie sick i came to an all out conclusion of all other movies i had seen in the past they will never compare to bob flanagans true life experience of living beyond the expected life span of a human with cf this man truly took his illness by the balls and showed the viewer that pain can be an issue that is manipulated in an entirely different way i found it very interesting how bob chose to be a slave to the woman he loves rather than a slave to his miserable disease those who dare watch as bob experiences life through the vice of pain those with weak stomaches beware
great plot ! a crooked president who only thinks of himself and his needs a good hearted man named dave who thinks about others and the only thing they have in common is their outward appearance dave is called upon to sit in for the president and do his job for a while two of the presidents regular staff try to get dave to do things that is contrary to dave 's character so the story goes on from there who will win the battle of crooked verses good in the white house this dvd picture was good and clear the sound was great and the case was in excellent condition if you like warm hearted type movies then this is the one for you i know i have enjoyed it over and over to me dave is about character good or bad and the choices we make in life that can affect others around us
i was leaning towards giving it only three stars because it has certain weaknesses but then i saw the ending and it was a beautiful one it always makes me happy to see love onscreen the side story of a jealous rival geisha constantly hurting our hero was annoying there really was n't any reason for it another part of the story i found annoying was the lack of communication between the main characters our hero was giving one man all the signals that she was interested but she in fact was interested in a different man who she was n't communicating with at all i do n't like having to witness problems that make no sense to me but then came that surprise ending so warm and affectionate that was nice
my review of the village mentions the sixth sense more than it does the village so here it is i do n't really want to talk a lot about this movie because i could spoil the effect instead i 'll talk about this filmmaker 's first movie the sixth sense also by night shyamalan i first saw it in december 1999 on a flight from chicago to hong kong my only flight out of the usa the film really pulled me in which i suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane then the ending based on the article you just read we can say that some viewers were n't surprised me i was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again years later i finally did i taught movie classes this is a film i chose and i saw it about a dozen times fully aware of the ending it had a bit more going for it than that my only complaint is with people who think bruce willis was the star the star is haley joel osment ! i may have missed out on the surprise ending '' because i was watching the kid instead of the shrink bruce willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we 'd never notice but i digress the village is about a village some place quaint rural close knit and low tech nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter those we do not speak of the acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood shyamalan is a masterful writer director and producer but i had trouble caring about what happened to his characters that could 've been my fault saturday morning at 8 jan was working and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but i was too drained to begin the neighbor had loaned us this dvd back in february so i figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start the same bad attitude that i brought to the sixth sense right one of these days i 'm going to watch a shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind the ending '' how would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on the ending '' in the case of the village it worked for me i thought about this film for days after seeing it actually i was trying to decide what to write in this review how about this shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium '' that 's a good thing no matter what your opinion of each individual film is i believe some critics are panning him but i 'm not panning this one i 'm glad i saw it i 've missed a few films between the sixth sense and the village and there will be more after the village i 'll watch them all
i have four boys between the ages of 11 and 2. i ordered seasons 1 2 and they love it every night we turn daniel boone on before bedtime and we do n't have to worry about our children seeing anything other than a good wholesome show i hope they put out the next 4 seasons
i thought this was a wonderful dvd because of the following factors goal of this billy blank 's dvd is to get kids off their feet and exercising in this day and age of television video games and a joke of physical education in schools it 's up to parents to stress the importance of regular fitness activity diversity is great the children on this dvd consist of both boys and girls ages of about 5 to maybe 12 or 13 years old all sizes from thin to slightly chubby and different nationalities blanks is just a very good instructor and you can see why he 's loved by young and old he motivates the kids and makes the moves entertaining for them even throwing in a couple of old dance moves SMILE billy blanks speaks from the heart and you can tell that he honestly wants everyone to be fit as far as the fitness level i could see kids doing this but it gets a little trickier when you get to the floor exercises if you have n't exercised in a while the good thing about this particular dvd is since it 's geared towards kids billy places less emphasis on getting moves perfect his main focus is to get the kids to realize that exercise is fun overall i think this is a great dvd to add to your collection it 's something you and your kids can enjoy doing together
denzel washington plays the legendary steve biko in this 's film while kevin kline plays a top journalist who befriends washington 's character in south africa denzel is my favorite actor and although he does n't get a lot of screen time this is one of his strongest roles ever and you know that 's saying a lot not only does he nail down the african accent but he portray 's biko 's renown concern and persistence this movie was awesome for the first hour i could not take my eyes off it ! as the inevitable came around this point the movie turns to kevin kline 's character who 's trying to escape south africa and spread biko 's story and message it drags on quite extensively the movie is over 2 hours but it still maintains enough to keep it 's rating in my book there were some other flaws like how quickly kline 's character switched from hostility to befriending biko that happened so quickly i could n't tell when they actually saw the film was beautifully shot especially for the 1980 's and i love the scene where biko is speaking at an outdoor stadium being held up by dozens of supporters keep an eye out for joseph marcell geoffry the butler from fresh prince of who has a couple crucial scenes at the end playing a character aptly named 'moses ' the reason this movie was so memorable to me was because it really got me thinking how oppressed black folks have been throughout history sure other movies have depicted this and maybe display this better but sh ! to find out how black people were even kicked aside and discriminated against in south africa was ! i am beginning to understand their frustration as a race and even those in america more and more seeing this movie and being caucasian myself you get a sense of why the black brethren distrust the white man or see him as evil and there 's no propoganda or direct bashing of the white race in this film just depiction i myself kind of feel like a jerk for what my race has done over all these years and believe me we may think this sh t 's resolved and straight today but we got a long ways to go ! you really got ta hand it to denzel he 's tackled some of the biggest black icons so effortlessly not only malcolm x reuben carter among others but steven biko as well he may just be an actor but he must have some strong beliefs in his own race as well to portray legends like these ! it would be great to see him start speaking up for his people and directly to his people a la bill cosby i got this movie off amazon because i could not find it in stores but i recommend searching for it yourself or buying it however you
i have heard both arrau and richter playing liszt 's b minor sonata and i am afraid i very much prefer the way yundi li had played this piece perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as arrau 's technique was always not that impressive yundi li is not just a virtuoso you are impressed not only by the shattering way he played for the more emotional part of this piece when liszt was supposed to struggle with his other side of character you will also be impressed by his every subtle nuance for the lyrical part of the music which you seldom hear from others you will also appreciate all the smooth transitions he made from one theme to another will i be able to hear a better and a more logical liszt 's b minor sonata than this i believe yundi li is capable of very deep feeling when he plays you seldom find one pianist more deeply immersed in the music during performance than yundi li music just flow out from his fingers in a most natural way as a result of such deep feeling i particularly agree with this description of yundi li '' what distinguishes this uniquely gifted young artist from most of his contemporaries is his ability to put his personal stamp on a work without resorting even for a single gesture to eccentricity '' although richter was technically more capable compared with arrau i have always found him not expressive enough for pieces that require more rubati you will be impressed by his technique for some beethoven sonata
li is no pianist neither is bunin or even zimerman and do n't foeget that chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all and judging from the steam and progess li has made lang lang 's position is certainly under threat and any viewer who is interested in li or how chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this here we have to thank martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the chopin competition now in his and musically out of almost nowhere li is already a full fledged musician of course viewers should not compare him with arrau 's fine balance between the extreme high and rather low register or his scales with richter 's this is not fair for arrau and richter are such great artists li is already so close to zimerman now furthermore what we hear may have more to do with the accoustics of the hall something which has more to do with the engineers than the performer himself and i say so because i 'm a bit concerned about the quality of the picture of this dvd it appears to me more like a vcd than dvd production or somewhere in between it is slightly below average dg production and the camerawork is also average only this is obviously not fair to a blossoming career that li is now having one star is taken for want of a better production
i thought beavis and butthead changed america their stupidity was a influence of a generation i sadly was not allowed to watch the show when it was on tv i was a child and in my elementary school years at the time and because i actually rather watch the episodes instead of having to watch music videos within the episode just like the duo themselves they hate a lot of music videos but watch them just to critize them and i do n't care for music videos i really love the show however like other people who also liked the show i have to agree with them to release all of the episodes for goodness sake ! i ca n't believe they did n't put in the customers suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one i have ever seen when the show was on tv because we want to see and have all of the episodes not just 80 of them and never get to see the other ones i guess this is still recommended but remember we all should fight back and get the remaining episodes back even if they have a lost episodes collection i do n't care the people want them and mike judge is refusing to give us them !
this amazed me when it first came out and still has that capability the combination of puppets and live action works really well david bowie is wonderful and all in all it 's a great family film when i gave it to my two granddaughters ages 8 4 they watched it and a little bit scared but then they watched it at least once a day for the next week
the professional reviewer missed the main point of jeffrey 's dilemma he 's not so afraid of getting aids he 's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it most people figure a 50 chance of dying before their spouse but taking on a person with a known fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate poignant situation steve weber is no gayer than george bush but he certainly is an enthusiastic kisser this was the first film i saw michael weiss in and he totally had me convinced he was gay i knew patrick stewart is n't but his performance is dead on overall a very funny movie with a big big heart
this movie was alright i give it five stars for being artsy quirky it makes gay love look systematically funny and easily made fun of even people with aids deserve a better look at their lives i do not have but have lost friends over it this is a movie for those who either want a good laugh or a good cry i know of nobody who really acts as these characters do i doubt it goes on in new york citys manhattan either purchase this if your just wanting to add to your glbt vhs or dvd collection
this dvd was more challenging than i thought but within a few short weeks i can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness recently someone who had not seen me in a while commented that my body looked different so i guess that means the programs really work haha SMILE overall i have been impressed with not only the level of difficulty but also the variety of content and workouts available i easily recommend this dvd
i truly love this film and it 's one of my top favorite film of all time the cinematography is absolutely beautiful if you enjoy violence beauitful scenery of brazil a great related story this film is absolutely brillant
i first bought the dvd for my mother for christmas she let me borrow it i am glad that i finally watched it it is a truly great movie it is a funny movie and very entertaining i suggest either renting it or buying it
i really enjoyed this movie rose mcgowan did a great job as the villianess debbie my favorite line from the movie it 's a family thing '' the movie was in my opinion a black comedy and rose totally looked like trailer trash on her first day of school brilliant ! you should definately watch this movie when you have n't got anything better to do
ever wonder where kurtz would 've ended up if he had survived the end of apocalypse now '' well now we know he exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals the horror the horror in light of all the bad press one would really think this is a lousy movie and i can see why some people do n't like it the main portion of the flick is really insane however if you 're a sucker for type yarns and appreciate the heavy mood insanity of apocalypse now '' you 'll probably like it i 'm not saying it 's anywhere near as great as apocalypse now '' but marlon brando and the jungle insanity make the comparison inevitable what works the title sequence is great perhaps one of the best in all of cinema another amazon reviewer noted this so i 'm not alone the soundtrack is phenomenal 'nuff said the plot is intriguing the humanimal is fine 'hyena ' looks especially horrific the film possesses an undeniable creative pizzazz it 's moody atmospheric and insane and marlon brando 's 35 minute stint in the film is as captivating as always you can probably tell i 'm a huge brando fan in particular jacks '' mutiny on the bounty '' 1962 the young lions '' superman '' and apocalypse now '' not redux '' what does n't work the third act of the film is almost total insanity except for the final ten minutes or so as a result the story will lose the interest of those who have no appreciation for such artistic flair closing thoughts i really enjoyed seeing brando in his old age in this flick it proves he had his magnetic charm until the end if you enjoyed brando as 'kurtz ' in apocalypse now '' you 'll appeciate him in island '' in fact as already noted moreau is a variation of kurtz in his old age nutjob in the jungle if you 're predisposed for such a flick moreau '' is weird but certainly worthwhile
i bought this dvd because it was listed as an imax title but it is also if you buy the special glasses from the manufacturer regular glasses dont work with this title the quality of the graphics are terrific the plot is a little strange but basically its aliens who invade and ride 4 virtual roller coasters at a futuristic theme park the rides are pretty good and the concept and setting behind each coaster is unique my kids love this dvd and its worth the price ! buy it from the new used section and you can get it for around 3.50 plus shipping
casts were chosen by the author hemingway himself that short comment on this film opening was really the miracle particularly gary cooper as american dynamiter roberto and ingrid bergman as hapless young girl maria could happen only through the number of miracles spain in your backyard as the movie opening says shooting took place sonora pass in california not in spain is n't it ironic because sierra nevada mountain range itself was named by spanish reminding them of the homeland mountains when they occupied the part of california bonded by movie deal at that time movie actors were strongly tied by contracts and that prevented both gary cooper and ingrid bergman from the role hemingway wanted on the film to win him the movie company had to pay huge money and maria took it by accicent she even cut her own hair to be maria eventually sacrificing the next movie role deletion of political aspect that is why the movie became successful and became a very entertaining one the movie focus on the love development between maria and roberto which was excellently shown though a bit bergman 's maria was so natural and you can see how far she was into the role but the time provided another politics american hero fighting against dictatorship an ally of nazi and facists that worked far better than any of government sponsored war propaganda i suppose supporting actors and actress supporting actors and actresses did the job quite well particularly i think anselmo was well performed pablo was also nicely acted particularly pablo grinning at the scene of falling snow is truly scary reminding me of jack torrarence of shining pilar is a bit of letdown but not bad the ending i suppect there was alternative version where roberto could survive but the ending place it quite vague old fashioned theatrical ploy i see why butch cassidy and sundance kid ends the similar way the bridge why must an american explode the bridge at the bridge at river kwai the answer might be here real american dynamiter hemingway might have probably heard of the story of american dynamiter somewhere and combined his own self to create the hero robert jordan the good war interviews the model of robert jordan irvin goff it is said maria was created by the image of ingrid bergman verdict very entertaining movie rating 91 out of 100 the presence of ingrid bergman alone contributes 10 point plus recommended for any of classic movie fans
i never bought the vhs tape but when i was notified this would be coming out on dvd i ordered it while i 'm not an amateur i am a professional eric is a guitarist 's guitarist anyone who thinks he do n't need learnin ' is a fool and only famous in his own little world small as it may be i 'm not that arrogant as danny gatton was known as the humbler eric johnson could rightly be called the inspiration what he does is not so much difficult as it is the epitome of finesse and transparency of technique after viewing this you will understand what i mean i already know much of what eric teaches in this session for that is what it is a private session much like you might get at git with a master at the top of his craft but there is always something to learn even after repeated viewings i even scanned in the booklet that comes with this so i can break the lessons down and blow up the individual charts for more easy reading if you are serious about improving as a player and if you 're looking to be a real professional you need to get this if only to see what true professionalism looks and sounds like the lessons are clear and focused and with the booklet and the new ability to slow down the examples you really can learn to play these things but do n't expect to sound like eric just as those who tried to but could never sound like jimi hendrix you are different and so will always sound different and that 's a plus but the techniques and all that are included here are part of a must learn '' program you need to create and follow if you want to at least make a good living playing music learn from a master of melody and technique where technique does n't get in the way of the melody but lives in service to the song the way it should be i teach too and i recommend to any student who wants to grow that they should get this dvd if you get no other this would serve whatever style you choose to pursue ultimately because there is so much here that can be applied to virtually any style whether it is jazz country blues rock or even acoustic which i wish he would have included a segment on that my only kvetch
sea of love is certainly a better than average steamy crime thriller but it did n't really bowl me over pacino 's very good of course and ellen barkin more than holds her own against him but pacino 's character can become tiresome after a while and what i regard as a pretty sizeable red herring thrown into your lap midway through the story makes the ending a little less dramatic i 'm not saying the mystery is predictable it 's just not that shocking of a surprise frank keller al pacino is n't exactly steve mcgarrett material when it comes to his career as a detective mainly because the guy is basically pretty pathetic his wife left him for another detective on the force and he 's not handling that very well drunken calls in the middle of the night to his are not uncommon the guy drinks like a fish all day and all night whether he 's on duty or not he gets into serious shoving matches with other cops and he spends more time getting under the skin of his fellow detective and 's new man than investigating the crime at the scene of the film 's opening murder later on he gets into a serious relationship with one of the murder suspects which has to break a lot of rules in the old code of conduct about all he gleans from the first murder is the fact that someone plugged a fat naked guy in the back of his head and that the killer was apparently a big fan of the song sea of love fortunately for him a queens detective played by john goodman working on a similar case teams up with him on a task force to find the mutual killer the common thread linking the murders together is the fact that each victim had recently placed a poetic personal ad in the newspaper since no one seems to have bothered looking at any of the evidence too closely keller and detective sherman goodman decide to place a similar ad in the paper meet all of the women who respond get their prints and compare them with those found at the murder scenes and break the case wide open keller meets helen ellen barkin at one of these undercover dates she blows him off early on before she even comes close to leaving a fingerprint on anything when they meet accidentally soon thereafter though a spark is lit and the two are lovers before you can say jack sprat frank puts his feelings for helen above his job thereby leaving helen hanging out there as a possible murder suspect this is where all of the suspense comes in is she or is n't she the story zigs and zags both ways on the question leaving the viewer in a measure of doubt until the very end the whole thing turns into a weird love story for the most part with frank trying to avoid losing helen even as he sometimes wonders whether she 's the killer he 's looking for it is quite suspenseful largely thanks to ellen barkin 's very strong performance the ultimate ending 's a little weak but that takes nothing at all away from the sustained mystery that will command your rapt attention all the way up to that point it 's not hard to see why the movie was so successful it just goes to show what good acting and a reasonably strong script can do for a movie there are probably two camps when it comes to the ending i should note but it 's not a hate it or love it thing some will not find it all that surprising while others may feel as if it comes right out of left field either way sea of love is a film that all fans of steamy thrillers can lose themselves in and at the very least come out feeling reasonably satisfied
film noir at it 's best lies betrayal deception sexual eroticism all through the movie you dont know who to cheer for the cop the dirty teacher the trailer trash chic the funny lawyer the school tramp the tramp 's mother the cop 's partner the tramp 's mother cuban lover you dont know who is who and what is up or down one big dirty camp of a describe it with only one word it would be yummy
there are so many reasons to like wild things '' it 's easy to call this movie perfect although it 's not the best movie ever made or even in the top 20 for that matter it truly is a perfect movie for what it could 've been i borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity well this movie does have a plot and it 's quite complicated some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes but you ca n't argue that this is a damned good movie matt dillon stars as sam lombardo a guidance counselor at blue bay high school lombardo is a lady 's man in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he 's done half of blue bay well lombardo has a student named kelly van ryan denise richards who i 've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie who seems to be coming onto him lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in blue bay well one day kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash lombardo 's car for the senior car wash and then we see kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face then kelly says lombardo raped her lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer bill murray well then another girl named suzie toller neve campbell says lombardo raped her as well another player in the plot is ray duquette kevin bacon the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories now this movie is one of those films where you think you know what 's going on and then they throw a wild card after that you think you know what 's going on again and then happens even when the movie ends you do n't know the full story until the credit sequence the sex scenes the most famous with denise richards matt dillon and neve campebell are quite nice but surprisingly the movie would be good without them this is a really great movie and worth the 5 bucks it would cost to buy it
first off i agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie when denise richards sees matt dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like is this just a game for the boys or can anyone play '' she looks so sweet and hot that it 's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later however she pulls ift off pretty well in fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well i could n't understand why kevin bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual but that was actually pretty good acting ca n't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists but it 's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing i give it 5 stars because it 's both fun and funny and of course very hot at times well worth a look
this movie looks simply amazing ! the color texture and detail provided by are superb this is a showcase title for the format first a word about my setup which is nice but far from optimal the player is connected via hdmi to a sanyo projector with an approximately 140 '' picture thrown onto a light beige wall the room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado 's but my family and i thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it now about the title there are no compression artifacts or mosquito noise to be found anywhere none i also bought this title on and have watched on an upscaling dvd player both on a 57 '' crt bigscreen and the projector and there are a distracting number of the aforementioned artifacts and mosquito noise in both cases they 're most noticeable on large surface solid colors of which there are many in this movie you 'll see them dance '' and shimmer on not so on the colors are bold and bright when appropriate but what really struck me while watching the title were the drabbish gray scenes such as the streets of the town with the factory looming in the background you can make out more detail without any obvious edge enhancement problems found in the original version the lights from the townsfolk dwellings were suffused with a soft glow in this latest version not a ringed mess the story itself is not necessarily an improvement over the original rather its told from a slightly different perspective giving more insight into willie wonka 's character and updating the other kids violet mike teavee etc to reflect a newer generation of youngsters mike feels a bit weak he 's portrayed as a videogame crazed violent kid in the sequence that introduces his character then sort of disappears into the background the rest of the movie veruca and violet by contrast are more prominently featured and you 'll develop more antipathy towards their characters by their actions throughout the movie augustus also suffers a bit but since he 's the first to get ousted from the party it 's logical that he wo n't be as fully developed as a character his romp through the initial scene whilst in the factory is pretty good however overall i 'd give this 5 stars not only as a visual and audible feast for owners but felt the movie was a great update to the original and stands on its own merits even in presentation
an extraordinary film the vanishing brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the american northwest the movie falls into the type of category kiefer sutherland jeff bridges nancy travis sandra bullock and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! very well written and very well presented it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again ! the setting the plot jeff 's strong sense of love devotion and determination are admirable and commendable and an example for all to follow ! the dialogues and the music are all wonderful ! in short the vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection !
a great reality show following a group of working class youths in england getting the chance to become cooks in a top uk restaurant for free it 's highly entertaining and well worth the price we caught this show when we were visiting australia and got hooked also check out jamie 's school dinners series available on amazon uk
i really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc i have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length the movie is about a giant gorilla ! it is a fantasy film kids ! the original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well i think the remake is incredible it better than the original in some ways yes ! in some ways no ! thats the way it goes ! i still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! i wish peter jackson would try to remake son of kong into as good a movie if he can pull that off SMILE
the premier american cinematic drama is the western and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns this set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side there are n't any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections it 's true that the majority of these are and some are unintentionally hilarious to view today there are some definite classics mcclintock under california stars along with plenty of simply enjoyable films just a note there are a few mistakes for example the santa fe trail '' included on this set is the 1930 richard arlen version it 's the errol flynn olivia haviland version which i personally feel is superior anyway also some films were taken either directly from television you 'll see a in stereo flash across the screen when you play the film or did n't transfer very well slight distortions in video or audio but considering the age of these movies and the cheap price tag this is an amazing deal !
the first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of usmc boot camp i have ever seen outside of actually being there i 've read that lee emery who played the senior drill instructor was initially hired to coach other actors for the role but he did such a perfect job himself that stanley kubrick hired him for the job if the film had ended after the first half alone it would have been phenomenal the second half of the film portrays the same boot camp marines from the first half who are now in viet nam the tone and the setting are much different as the men engage in a number of battle situations including a fairly gruesome scene with a female sniper where the first half of this film is almost comical at times the second half is much more serious and grave overall this is a serious and engaging movie that brilliantly describes military experiences on and off the battlefield
i enjoyed the movie very much since i love the idea of knights and castles during the middle ages and as merrick says when men still had honor i wanted to join them just for the excitement and the chance of a lifetime besides i 'm a sap for a great looking guy saving his damsel in distress at all costs even if it mea n't changing history i liked that they portayed lady clair as a tough stand up to the bad guy do what needed to be done spy for her brother to win the battle kinda lady

ok i understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters they are the traditional mars '' and venus '' symbols representing masculinity and femininity i also understand the last symbol representing infinity '' a loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever or maybe the propagation of eternal life '' by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity but what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values the star of david representing judaism and a cross representing christianity i have n't seen the movie in years but i do n't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot please also forward your thoughts to vboston at

okay how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants unless you were one of the misery causing you did n't this movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena but takes a good crackshot at the mothers kirstie alley 's character is a real gem ! it also makes fun of the people in minnesota i see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film but heard the term midwest '' used far more often we feel your pain but i would have laughed had they picked my state which is very close to mn they poke fun at hunters lutherans yes i 'm one and lutefisk for lunch in high school i 'm also of norwegian decent the most fun to be had is the way this movie spoofs how nasty women can be regardless of class warfare and what lengths some of them will go to just to get their way funny and like the nailhead beneath a hammer this movie is a nasty and fun treat for everyone who has ever been treated badly by the local uppercrust enjoy 100 minutes of vengeance and then go out into the world feeling better about the fact that you 're definitely not alone !
art history has always been an interest of mine and i 'm a big fan of other art movies such as girl with a pearl earing '' and merchant of venice '' so when i found out about modigliani i was happy to take the time to go watch it not only was it worth my time but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion was n't looked fondly on everything about the movie is amazing from the sets to the acting i feel this is one of andy garcia 's best films in some time not only is he convincing but he fits the part of modigliani better than any other actor could they focused the movie around his rivalry with picasso which i find to be one of the most interesting things about it you do n't only get an insight into one artist but many you see the life the artists were living and the obstacles they had to overcome to get their art out into the world modigliani also had a tragic romance with a young catholic girl who 's father did n't want her with the struggling painter the story is the perfect depiction of the religious standards in that time period overall this was a great movie and i would strongly suggest that you take the time to check it out you wo n't regret it it 's probably one of the best movies of the year
i have both madonna grimes workouts dvd 's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts it was a great way to start my day i was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same but with disapointment comes satisfaction the other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts and learn a workout that i never thought that i would learn and enjoy doing jayna 's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning also great moves you can use for other reasons rania 's upper body is really fun some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot suhaila workout i am intimidated by i have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it i have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks she can contract them one at a time some mornings i get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape they are really fun this tape has a bonus yoga i had never tried yoga and this gave me an opportunity to try it i highly recommeded this i love the 10 minute workouts with this there are no excuses you can always find 10 minutes in a day

i just finished watching when harry met sally for probably the tenth time it 's been years since i 've seen it and i enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend i could n't get over the fact that i still laughed several times almost as if i 'd never seen the movie before my interpretation after all these years was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments infatuation etc without stooping to sugary sentiment i took harry and sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable i did n't see them as somehow representative of all men '' or all women '' then i watched the extra documentary on the dvd which i had never seen until now big mistake my new interpretation '' of the film was suddenly cast aside as i remembered that i actually did n't like this movie as much when it first came out over time i had grown to accept the fact that i could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved what i had forgotten was billy crystal 's rob reiner 's director and nora ephron 's writer agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders gag the views of the characters are presented as if they were fact men supposedly always think about sex and ca n't be friends with women most if not all women have faked an orgasm all men are clueless to the fakery and so on i can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the boomer generation and older folks no one on this film is even close being a member of gen x because this does not represent the reality of all humans you 'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to prove '' their case if they 'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it no i wo n't fake it if he sucks in bed i 'm going to tell him '' and as for men some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it none of this changes this classic film that 's the great thing about art it 's open to interpretation i can watch this film and define it my way two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love otherwise i 'd hate this movie but i wo n't give reinder ephron et al that much power just because they were narrow minded about gender roles does n't mean i have to be about their film if you agree with the characters in the film by all means watch the documentary but if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters pass it by do n't let a dvd extra taint your pov
the movie was great ! ! but they left a few things out in the movie that were in the book ! ! there were more siblings in the book but this is still a must see and must read !
love the book could n't wait for the movie and was not disappointed ! i have watched it many times and enjoy it each time the story was so involved and the movie just about captured every event which is why it took two dvds or 3 cds yes i have both to show the entire story a great way to spend a cold winter day
this is one of the best photography documentary i have ever seen i love photojournalism and this is as good as it gets i love the story narration that this dvd succeeds in james nachtwey is the greatest ever to have photographed all the atrocities up close and personal you can feel the pain agony and raw human emotion in his photographs he is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger it needs guts and commitment to do a job which has constant fear of getting killed i salute you nachtwey you inspire me uday
the seventh season was the season that got me hooked to south park specifically episode number about the mormons that was the first episode that got me into the show and i have n't stopped watching since the season list includes the following kripples paper a little bit country butt and pancake head stopper greed park is guay ! rock hard dawn bonita about the mormons out christmas in canada also favorites from this season include 'm a little bit country which has the kids working on a report to present at the rallies i just love cartman 's flashback in time to 1776. also episode hard rock cartman and his band faith +1 make it big in christian music to try and score a platinum album before kyle does all over a 20 bet finally episode park is guay what can i people who the heck thinks of crab people in all this is the season that continues to have me in stitches and if you can only own one season of southpark i believe this is the one i myself have them all but this is the season i believe stands above the rest
absolutely brilliant ! if you are a south park fan this has got to be added to your collection matt and trey have lost none of their wit and i ca n't wait until the eigth season is released ! i had to purchase it from the usa i live in england as it 's not yet available over here and it actually cost less to buy and have it shipped over than it was to buy the previous six seasons in the shops
i really enjoyed this dvd it was sent through the postal system in very guickly thanks
if your not already hooked on the story of these interns you have some catching up to do its not your typical medical drama and certainly worth
movie was pretty good coming of life story about a boy from jersey trying to make it as a bartender in the hottest club in the city addresses teen issues such as drug abuse sex betrayal jealously and family
i owned this movie in full screen on vhs the quality of the transfer of apollo 13 '' with the wide screen and the incredible clearity hd that was never possible before makes this movie a true cinematic experience one of tom hanks ' best movies ! since we 're revewing here the hd version i own a new samsung 61 '' hdtv and the toshiba 399 from amazon an incredible improvement over my 1998 60 '' standard sony tv if you have the right setup it is the true home theater dream that we all hoped for since the dawn of home video back in the late 70 's or early 80 's be sure you use the hdmi cable or at least component connection the audio track is also great ! with the right dolby 5.1 also lots of extras on the ntsc us version including interviews with hanks and some of the real astronauts
great movie ! make it part of your collection good story beautiful video and great sound turn your volume up on the and you will feel the power !
this movie is a real departure for the director akira kurosawa in that it blends his humanistic movies like ikiru '' with a bit of action and drama yojimbo sanjuro '' the majority of the movie follows a young and arrogant doctor forced to work in a rural and poor region of japan under a domineering senior doctor naturally everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour midway through the movie out of nowhere one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission it is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief confusing and brutal toshiro mifune and kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director 's work changed radically still good but i 'll always prefer the b w epics the two of them made together
ahh remincing about the old days of youth this dvd is great for the young and the old comedy that surpasses all generation its a great gift
i bought this only because i loved the first one hoping it was n't as terrible as the second after i watched it i was so impressed first of all i loved that it really did n't have anything to do with the first aside from cassidy being katherine 's cousin and sharing the same last name there is only one reference to katherine and sebastian in the beginning it is much better than having different actors playing old characters which drags a movie down alot i thought the story was great with good whole cast is very attractive which ca n't hurt either the bad '' characters are all pretty likeable aside from one and all is well in the end the best thing about this movie is the character cassidy i sarted out hating her and ended up really liking her for her realness and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a this actress does a particularly good job pulling off both loveable and complete brat at the same time i would definetly reccomend this movie
goal ! is a soccer version of the road to glory in athletics it is a true cinderella story that makes the impossible possible and fulfills the one in a million shot at stardom the soccer player a young hispanic man in los angeles gets a chance to tryout for english premier league power newcastle as the movie progresses more and more people believe in the young man 's dream his family relationships are present and in the movie as is a budding romance we see the young player learn about the consequences of his decisions there are enough conflicts and challenges in this movie that keep it interesting the soccer presented in the movie is very we see actual professional players make cameo 's on and off the headbutts though a few times i felt like i was watching an actual english premier league game there are just a few too many spin moves over the ball but they look cool this is a good movie with a good begining and good ending i am glad i watched it and recommend it especially to soccer fans
i ca n't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars i do n't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews but this is certainly not a bad movie i was in grade when it came out and i remember how popular it was back then everyone and i mean everyone loved it no one said they did n't like it even my dad to this day says he would n't mind watching the movie a few more times and he never wants to watch a movie more than two times the actors the direction the story everything about this movie worked it 's a movie that will remain a classic forever there 's something here for everyone
this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out an excellent and energetic movie from the start plot is cutesy it serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences however i think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes i would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me if memory serves me did n't alex receive a letter from her friend hannah when alex discovered hannah passed away is n't there a reconnection at the end between mickey and alex 's girl friend whom the latter was dating was n't there more of a story between alex and her boss if this version is cut in anyway i prefer getting the complete and unedited version i find this version incomplete somehow but jennifer beals looks terrific and one wonders why she did n't star in more movies for her generation
now this is a rock n ' roll show from rock 's good guys '' pearl jam is probably the most important band ever in american music they are to the us what led zeppelin was to britain this concert is a fantastic representation of their mature shows no you wo n't see a lot of or moshing any more from these 30 and 40 somethings just a lot of great music and wonderful lyrics mike mccready is quite possibly one of the world 's most underrated soulful guitarists and his playing just sounds even better when you can see what those fingers are doing at first i was not a fan of adding boom gaspar to the shows but i have come to quite enjoy his contributions and pretty much consider him a bona fide member of the band as i do matt cameron who filled in a revolving throne '' back when jack irons left due to back problems after yield '' there are some true gems on this recording and the concert goes on and on with lots of music and a nice long encore the crowd is in the thing from the beginning and the band is on '' and every member is in their 'zone ' and seems to be having a fantastic time only cameron true to form seems a bit stoic '' highlights of this dvd are lukin '' black '' thumbing my way '' last exit '' and save you '' however the band just goes to a heavenly plane with low light '' faithful '' and in my tree '' there ai n't much from versus and 10 on this one with the band more oriented towards their more organic '' '' and vibey '' feel which has turned off some of the hard rocking '' pj fans however if you listen back pj has always had the pensive laid back rockers even in the explosive days of the early 90 's with songs like black '' daughter '' alive '' oceans '' and the like just because the band has chosen to explore other instruments and rhythms and to mature as a complete organism has caused some to reject them because they do n't rock hard enough '' and that is ridiculous as one will see on these dvd 's this is the best representation of pj 's wonderful live shows on official '' record ben harper makes a wonderful appearance or two as does tony barber the bass player for the buzzcocks who is forever immortalized on dvd for not knowing the bassline for sonic reducer '' overall the performance is just about as tight as a live performance gets and the camera angles and picture quality is pretty good most of the time the extras are good but ed 's solo guitar version of dead man '' stands out as a heartfelt amazing performance down '' an underrated song from the record lost dogs '' is merely a backdrop for some footage which is fine but i 'd much rather hear what the boys are saying and see a live performance of the song if you 're a fan of rock and roll or pearl jam you already own this dvd if you 're just now waking up from your coma then get this now ! study it learn the methods of pj and you too can become the best band in america ! boys who only know even flow '' and alive '' need not
wonderful show fun episodes great actors dvd boxset comes with confidentials with behind the scene footage however the confidentials are shortened versions from the full confidentials shown on television but only footage of the old series of doctor who was removed worth the money
what can i say on a scale of 1 thru 10 this movie goes to 11 !
most people does n't realize that this band suck 's ! ! ! ! i am a rocker fan '' but please ! ! is not because this band does n't know how to play music or is fictional is beacause it suck 's ! ! the reason that spinal tap suck 's is because of their bloopers in and most of all their stupid lyrics ! ! ! ! ! i mean '' you know what i need or maybe you do n't ! ! ! ! ! '' lisen shhhhh ! ! what the flower people say aaaaahhhhh ! ! ! ! ! '' the cats meow ! ! ! '' sex farm woman ! ! ! '' big button ! ! ! ! '' i just want to make some eardrums bleed ! ! ! ! '' come on ! people ! ! ! ! try to realize why this movie is sooo funny ! beacuse all the people like a band that is pure garbage ! ! ! ! ! ! but do n't get me wrong ! i did enjoy this movie documentary really because is a parody of the rock bands in the 60 's 70 's and early 80 's and their music is loud fast and heavy ! ! ! adios
this is a fascinating look at the journey through the first 5 books of the bible it 's a visual foundation for stories that all three major religions the jews the christians and the muslims hold sacred to their faith and their traditions as a documentary the journey takes place today '' in the midst of the struggles and misunderstandings that make it realistic and for our faith today if you want to understand the bible this is an amazing way to see the stories that most people of the world hold as sacred to their beliefs and faith
i love sandra bullock movies in this movie she is so innocent and falls in love with a man she has never spoken to but saves his life on the cta in the time that he is still in a coma his family thinking she is their son 's fiancee fall in love with her she inadvertantly falls in love with his brother i jus love the cinderella story line she is fantastic as well as the family and especially bill pullman
while roman polanski was avoiding authories in america in 1988 he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller it stars harrison ford in a rather unique role that of a doctor an every man type such as jimmy stewart in the man who knew too much '' without the indiana jones hype although filmed 18 years ago it seems more contemporary that ever a fine thriller that even hitch would approve ! what is not contemporary is the fact that we consumers here in region 1 north america that 's right canada too get nothing but junk garbage from the releasing studios lousy grainy transfers in the edited pan scan format not fit for anything but a 7 '' dvd personal viewer maybe ! why is this and most any other movie presented in it 's original aspect ratio available in region 2 europe but not on this side of the pond disney is by far the major offender in this area but hey what say you warner it was always thought that the mighty oceans would protect us from our enemies both foreign and domestic proved that wrong and i guess nobody though of hollywood as a band of american home video terrorists a silly statement but ever so true ! this region 1 dvd release of frantic '' says it all
nice movie with a resonable story and a keeper for anyone looking to add in his collection great nude scenes with angelina jolie
this is a great documentary alex jones is not a nut just very passionate about the quality or lack of our governments our leaders are swine and so are our neighbors if they continue to be willfully ignorant of these truths
the replicant proves that van damme can really act he again portrays two people as in double impact he is both a villan and his dna duplicate hence replicant '' van damme displays a great range of emotions as the replicant like a child discovering the world as the villan he 's truly psycho the feds make the replicant of this serial killer called the torch in hopes of learning how to catch him the story line will keep you watching in suspense and guessing do n't look for all of the usual martial arts scenes here
everyone should see this movie it does not matter if your gay or straight
after much debate i decided to view this film with an open mind the performances are outstanding i really liked the music composition as it flowed gently with the story in a way i 'm glad this film didnt't win best picture '' for one reason the scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch maybe its too perfect later on we find out it 's not wyoming but it alberta canada take a star away ! overall this is a movie that will advance gay right in the united states for those who do n't like it the train has left the station !
astonishing you have to see it to believe just turn off the lights seat back and have fun and amazon delivery is realy great
this is one of my favourite christmas movies along the lines of it 's a wonderful life modern style cage is perfect in this surprisingly ! tea leone is a great supporting actress and the little girl is adorable all around a wonderful movie some mature content though so not for the younger viewers robbery and sexual nature in parts
the documentary was really really good they left some stuff out of it of course but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense one thing i did not remember was the prodigious mullet brian sported back in the day man i think that thing was more impressive than jagr 's mullet of the ! i do n't know that i learned anything new from the documentary but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing also stone cold talking about the hollywood blonds tag team was great fun they really played up the flyin ' brian stuff as being ahead of it 's time which it was and the loose cannon character that had everyone guessing funny thing is that the whole loose cannon thing was n't really if you think about it the gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill the accident was glossed over he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his 's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not he knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him anyhoo the official coroner 's report was that he had a heart attack just as his dad had at a young age of course the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over i mean the wwe is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a ahem sports entertainer '' is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job it 's the whole argument on a human scale the truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in best parts were reliving the hollywood blonds stuff i remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and steve were going to be huge stars steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in wcw they never name the booker but i am 90 sure that it was ric flair back then who headed the booking committee i am also 80 sure that arn was on the committee too they must have felt threatened by the flare for the old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a tbs special in i am guessing 1992 or 1993. great stuff though and brian came up with the whole gimmick they were so hilarious together another great part was jim ross talking about how he believed that he had become a to brian in the wwf that was sad stuff jr really had a hard time trying to help brian but pillman only saw the fact that jr order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal overall i am going with 4 crutches out of 5. i have n't watched any of the matches as yet but i am less interested in that kind of thing than i am the documentaries
thank you for making another great dvd box set and also stone cold i got it this morning and popped this bad boy in and love it a must buy if your a old school wrestling fan or a new one i do n't regret buying this at al
i 'm new to the world of pilates and this dvd is very helpful the instructor explains everything clearly so that you can be sure of doing each pose correctly the great thing about this dvd is that now that i 'm getting comfortable with pilates i can continue using this video because it lets you chose workouts for beginners intermediates and advanced there 's no need to buy any additional dvds ! and days that i do n't have time to fit in a whole workout it also gives you time ranges to choose from this video is worth buying for those wanting to try pilates i 've recommended it to my friends and they all use it now

skillful direction screenplay camera angles acting SMILE i could n't understand benicio del toro 's mumbling it turns out he did that on purpose as he said in the special features
a family oriented film that is humorous fun exciting and very entertaining ! after seeing this movie for the first time i had to own it ! it is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean this is a must own for the family
this movie is one of the best movies to ever grace theatres ! i think everybody is wrong when they say that the additional footage is not worthy and should be in the special featres menu because one of my favorite parts which is when vivian tells edward that she wants to stop into the club to see her best and runs into her pimp boyfriend carlos the extras are fabulous and could n't be better so pick up a copy of this movie toda
pretty woman anniversary special edition has to be considered one of the most classical romantic comedies made throughout the years julia roberts and richard gere are excellent actors together and without them i do n't believe the movie would have been the same this classic fairy tale '' movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest this is not your typical romantic movie and i believe that is why so many people love this movie pretty woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there the anniversary special edition also brought some scenes deleted scenes and commentary the deleted scenes are also a must watch they are just simply hilarious and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies but who also likes added comedy as well pretty woman is definitely one of the greatest films ever made

wow this a great series have to strongly recommend it has the feel of sienfeld with over the top humor clever awkward somewhat vulgar excellent
over the years people have grown tired of natural disaster movies why because they all appear to be the same here 's an example of a typical everything starts out nice and calm the story focuses on one family the family starts having problems and they split up and then a volcano tornado hurricane or whatever hits and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger just so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie well that kind of typical storyline is n't featured here twister is truly a classic it 's not ordinary either it 's about a group of tornado chasers who as you guessed drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get film of a twister up close and personal this means the film delivers the most amazing action i have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films and i remember in 1996 how influential this movie was i was in grade and the science teacher played twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was so good and much better than other tornado films helen hunt plays a magnificent role she is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she 's going through what 's great about this is that despite giving us a really good story about a divorce this does n't interfere with all the tornado action there are many good scenes in twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it 's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie favorite scenes well everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air so i wo n't pick that one i really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it that 's just one of many awesome scenes the storyline is really good too it 's not just a story about a divorce between helen and her husband there 's a lot more to it than that it 's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action against her will this is such an awesome movie i highly recommend it tornado movies do n't get any better than this pure action from beginning to end you will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger twister will make you think twice if you 're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser
personally i really enjoyed premonition it 's got solid acting a fascinating and often story and some decent scares however do n't expect an all out fright fest or you 'll be sorely disappointed this is a film with a plot that progresses fairly slowly patience is necessary when viewing premonition as is a willingness to accept ambiguity and logic in a film but for those of you who possess those qualities and are looking for something a little different particularly if you 're a fan of the genre premonition might be for you
this movie is fantastic ! it is defo on my fav list one of the best !
setting theme s castlerock smallville summer friends ' adventure life 's lessons solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown this 1986 instant classic of rob reiner 's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film the musical score is dramatic it sets the tempo from start to finish and it never misses a beat each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie 's unfolding and you do n't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding the lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient lazy summer days of grandeur to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity one can in stand by me favorably assume to watch pie eating contests leeches trains train dodging mail ball fancy cars fancy footwork verno 's beloved comb 's freefall cantenes thought they disappeared ben franklin 's outlets junkyard dog chases and much much more the ending is the real gravy the narration is superb also by far one of the favorite films of my youth believe john cusack can be seen playing the role of gordy 's football star elder brother stand by me is the childhood that big city life just does n't afford at least not anymore everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses rustic destination spots like the ones presented in this movie are still out there folks with a smidgen of ambition toward adventure which will take your there the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors five stars for reiners finest photoplay
i 'm a colin firth fan but that 's not the only reason this movie was a great ride it 's because it is a great ride just enjoy you will find yourself in stitches the contrast between new england dry humor and brit dry humor it 's just too funny oliver colin you guys are the best ! ! !

half light is a movie my wife would like if i can convince her that it 's not too scary for her she is the most timid of movie goers and refuses to watch horror movies with me but half light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense there are some scares but at the most tepid edge of today 's horror the movie is much more about the grief of a mother have the kleenex box close by and has a big love story with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse ugh in the middle of it just the kind of thing my wife might like when she 's willing to see something on her scary side unfortunately for me this is not my kind of movie at all even so it was well made it was well acted the english locations were impressively beautiful the story was interesting and had a good plot twist at the end ah what the heck i guess i liked it after all
the third installment of our favorite wizard has him meeting a new defense of the dark arts teacher along with some rather scary gatekeepers as the magical world hunts for sirius black harry 's godfather who has escaped from the dreaded azkaban prison meanwhile hermione discovers a way to time travel with a special locket and take more classes it is definitley getting darker and darker but this third in a series sets the tone for harry 's destiny

csi miami having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons reaches its high point in season 3. anyone who has watched the show realizes that horatio unlike gil grissom or mac taylor is the true star of the show the rest of the csis are entertaining but the show is truly about him this dynamic when combined with the glamour and glitz of the miami setting and crimes most foul make this for me the csi that is above the rest plotwise season 3 is bit over the top issues covered in this season include a stalker murder a sports star on trial for his wife 's murder a young woman killed in a club the murder of a uniformed cop gang warfare in a hospital the killings of irs agents speed dating that ends in a death spree killing and the murder of a wingwoman some of the lesser episodes involve our old friend clavo cruz a giant boa contricter that eats a woman skaters and gamers and of course the infamous tsunami episode the season incorporates the raymond caine subplot heavily in the last 5 or 6 episodes this leads up to a satisfying conclusion in the season finale the season is also one of change a regular cast member gets killed in episode 1 which quite frankly was quite a relief since the character was terrible another regular not a csi kills himself a new cast member joins officer ryan wolfe makes the transfer from patrol to csi and making some waves in the process callie and delco who has very little to do this season have a tough time dealing with tragedy and we actually see horatio dating a rather attractive assistant da at least for a few episodes some old familiars pop by including suzy and madison and raymond caine 's killer bob who ends up being much more important in the story than we assumed all in all it adds up to a great season which will be extremely difficult to top in season 4. people either love or hate this show so if you count yourself among the fans this is a must addition to the collection corwin m

with present day footage masterfully juxtiposed with much heretofore unseen period film this history of the great war breathes life into the first quarter of the twentieth century unlike an i 've seen thus far we are shown how the echoes of events that occured nearly a century ago still resonate with deafening clarity in our century lives the mistakes which plunged the world into a decades long bloodbath are laid out in a way that describes in riveting detail the follies and grave consequenses of cavalier militarism this series is neither dry or pedantic but illumunates facts with which everyone should be acquainted perhaps we can avoid a repetition of this debacle
rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence teenage angst sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from alexander payne reese witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range matthew broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for witherspoon 's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality in his screen debut chris klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against witherspoon and jessica campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty one of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election reese prays to an unfamiliar god and beseeches him to let her win so she can carry out his divine plan '' campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to while goofy klein shows the most depth by thanking god for all of his blessings especially his large penis and telling god he knows the best candidate will win election is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind enjoy

i was totally taken with this new rendition of the broadway musical the only downside is that i 'm not much of an alec baldwin fan but he did ok ! i encourage anyone who enjoys a heartwarming musical to see this one
what i enjoy most about this movie is not what i particularly enjoyed when it first came out being 11 when it came out i was attracted to the urbanism of which i was not too familiar with i did n't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood but it was no inglewood either i think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film the urban youth seeing for the first time thier lives on a film of this caliber and the suburban youth somehow glorifying this life while i still enjoy the entire film what i particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film the story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders ca n't be tamed by her she sends him to live with his father who is in many ways her equal but he is a man and one of her lines in the movie is i ca n't teach him how to be a man that 's your job '' how true this is not to sound sexist because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother because of an abusive father etc but you need a man to teach you to be a man larry fishburne 's charachter in this movie does this perfectly one quote i know you think i 'm being hard on you tre but i 'm not what i 'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility your friends across the street do n't have anyone to do that your'e gon na see how they end up too '' i loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents while divorced raise their son the way they know best and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal i 'd have to say that my favorite character is furious yes reva tre 's mom played an equally strong part but i loved how real '' furious was young '' tre i thought played an excellent part better than gooding maybe overall a great movie it 's success made it harder for corporate america to ignore the reality of youth as it exists today
a great suspense movie with terrific slow adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy brian de palma does a super many called it a ripoff '' with this film and the widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on tapes the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by a dennis franz who has hair here ! the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it 's apparent who the killer is it 's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women
strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb '' is of the films that are considered stanley kubrick 's masterpieces the other two are 2001 a space odyssey a clockwork orange it 's a satire released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today whenever you look at a list of great movies it 's on there it holds a place on the american film institute 's top 100 26 the american film institute 's top 100 comedies 3 is featured in roger ebert 's the great movies '' and is just overall acknowledged as a fine piece of cinema the movie opens with general jack ripper sterling hayden launching an unauthorized nuclear attack against russia the general is clearly mad and believes that the russians are polluting everyone 's valuable bodily fluids the only person who can stop ripper is captain mandrake peter sellers a british guy who listens to ripper 's ranting in disbelief meanwhile at the pentagon the president of the united states president muffley peter sellers again assembles a meeting in the war room where he is told hesitantly by general buck turgidson george scott that the bombers can not be recalled no one can reach ripper etc in one of the most hilarious characters i 've ever seen portrayed on screen we meet strangelove peter sellers yet again a strategist aiding the people in the war room strangelove 's right hand covered in a black glove has a mind of its own it frequently throws up nazi salutes and tries to kill strangelove also happening in the story is one of the planes heading to russia to drop the bomb the ruler of the cockpit is major king '' kong slim pickens a character that was supposed to be played by sellers but reportedly could n't because sellers had recently suffered a broken angle the scene where kong rides a nuclear bomb as if he was riding a bull is one of the scenes in the movie that you 're not likely to forget now this is a funny and important film but it 's not my favorite kubrick film nor is it the most entertaining kubrick film but due to it 's significance and the performances by sellers hayden and especially scott it definitely deserves the term masterpiece '' entertainment b humor importance a overall grade
this black and white masterwork of film is a must see for all this is a not just a courtroom movie but an examination of ourselves and how we see each other reginald rose 's original play reads like a powerhouse even in a highschool english class but given the direction of sidney lumet the dynamite cast and the beautifully stark black and white cinematography it becomes a legend on film this movie centers on the diverse jury and it 's deliberations in the murder trial of a young puerto rican man accused of killing his own father it is an examination of our perception of one another our selfish nature our apathy when a crisis does not affect us and our preconceived ideas of each other not based not upon fact but upon our own experiences and traumas it sheds light on how we process our decisions and how we can be easily yet unknowingly swayed away from the truth and yet believe we make honest and fair evaluations of fact when in all truth we do not this was the only film in which henry fonda starred and was the producer and it was slow to take off at the box office but within a few years this film became an american film mainstay regardless of the stunning performances and positive reviews he never produced again this film has many of the early television and film greats and each gives a riveting performance ! ! ! there 's jack klugman martin balsam john fiedler marshall and lee cobb who gives one of the most memorable performances in the film cobb who was known for his moving portrayal of willie loman in death of a salesman is aggravating and compelling fonda depicts the voice of reason '' juror that is neither or wimpy he challenges the other jurors and the viewer alike to rethink their conclusions and recalculate them by utilizing all the facts anyone that sees this movie will recognize at least someone they know that is like each juror which are designated only by number throughout it 's entirety in their daily lives do n't let the black and white format sway you this dvd is presented in a lovely widescreen format that intensifies the expert cinematic talents of the golden age of the silver screen this is considered an essential for anyone that loves film my thirteen year old actually sat mesmerized through the whole film and began to watch some of my other dvds to kill a mockingbird inherit the wind judgement at nuremburg to name a few and at that tender young age he is determined to spread the word and keep the tradition of sharing these movies of great metaldiva sez this is one of the essential films you should watch and share with your friends and family this is an excellent price to own and to share get it today
i feel this movie should be seen by all it 's awesome and really makes you think you get very attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling i highly recommend it ! awesome movie
it 's really refreshing to watch series such as bones it 's witty and suspenseful unlike law and order this show has more well everything the characters are all very likeable there are little romantic moments between the main characters that make the show more interesting basically just get season 1 you wo n't regret it
i have n't watched the first season i just started watching the show so i 'm a very brand new viewer but i 've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show its subject matter is grim yes but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry especially david boreanaz buffy the vampire slayer angel and emily deschanel the stories are interesting being too scientific so anyone can follow along and i never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone 's bones okay maybe only in tv land
scholl die letzten tage ' scholl the final days ' follows the last six days of the life of sophie scholl member of white rose ' small organization that protested against hitler through the method in the munich her life had been filmed in germany twice before white rose ' by michael verhoeven and five last days ' by percy adlon both in 1982. unfortunately i have n't seen them but the fact proves that this organization during the wwii in germany some part of which still remain mystery has been always a very fascinating topic in that country now using the unpublished materials that were unavailable then german director marc rothemund made another film based on this important episode in the german history this time he gives stress to the realistic description of the last six days of sophie scholl a college student who was arrested with her brother during the political activities against the nazi in 1943. actually sophie was only posting and scattering the fliers in college campus but that was enough for the nazi at first however they were not sure sophie is just an ordinary student and the nazi interrogator robert mohr was not convinced the film spends considerable time in depicting the dialogues between sophie scholl and robert mohr and the rising tension between two characters supported by historical material and strong acting is one of the most impressive parts of the film consequently the film becomes a bit talky sometimes but both julia jentsch edukators ' and gerald alexander held did a fantastic job as two realistic persons with souls without making them too saintly or monstrous if you 're looking for the facts about the white rose itself you may be disappointed the behaviors of sophie and hans her brother before their arrest by the police look incredibly reckless far from that of organized resistance the film would not tell you much about what the group was really doing before they were caught because it is about the spiritual transformation of sophie scholl i do n't know anything about the historical accuracy of the film but it is clear that the filmmakers took great care to present the most accurate portrait of sophie scholl see the detailed procedures of the court for example because of that the film sometimes gets slower than it should be but still the powerful acting from the actors are as fascinating as this historical event itself but the strongest or i should say the most shocking part of the film is waiting for you at the end of the film one image still haunts my mind which i ca n't tell you of course but all i can say is prepare for one sequence that is more unnerving and disturbing any suspense or horror films like ' another gripping german film about the nazi scholl die letzten tage ' gives you a realistic image of a human during the war and this is a story about one person that lived an extraordinary life

we own three baby faith dvd 's our favorite is god made music '' followed by god made me '' god made animals '' while still a good video is our least favorite for one the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing but judge for yourself i 've posted some pictures the frog was creepy since when do frogs have lips the visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too and the undersea clips at the end looked as old as cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one son who is entranced by the other two videos but does n't seem to care much for this one my suggestion watch before you buy if you can if your kid likes it go for it if not try the other videos you may get a different reaction
i do n't care what people say i got it right off the bat what the movie was about i joy it as well alien predator kids it worked just fine for me you got to love predator butt those cool look aliens it 's fun watching i 'll enjoy years to come calling spaceship earth thank for the trip thanks for dropping me at back home based more on comic books alien predator '' not so much on passed alien movies or predator movies
i 'm not a big fan of tom or demi and jack even wears out his welcome in some films but not here the supporting roles are superbly done the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end and when this shows up on cable tv i almost always watch it again for a or so here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict and that reflects a lot of real life in the usa during the past four years i enjoy the script because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force
i have been a fan of csi since the first season has come out i am an avid collector of dvds and i 'm way behind i 'm on another show right now as we speak anyway i love the sound and the special features are always low but i do n't mind that there is just one thing that i did not like part of the cover case on my season four dvd came off it still fits into my dvd collection and i obviously wo n't buy another copy because the dvd 's are working fine but the plastic may come into a problem
had this movie on vhs and my family wore it out ! an unexpected gem in the harry potter tradition
this was a wonderful story telling about the italian immigrants that started their businesses in new york their determination long hours and love of family represent the values those immigrants brought to america if you love to cook have an italian heritage you 'll enjoy this film
could n't believe that this was the same john lithgow who starred in third rock from the sun '' an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on nbc john plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by denzel 's character was n't expecting much but this movie was surprisingly entertaining yes it was a little violent and some parts were a tad unbelievable but overall denzel and john were worthy antagonists boy denzel sure was gorgeous ! ! still is
a movie such as this in the german language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic furthermore the actors who play the key roles especially hitler but also goebbels speer himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie what sets the film apart from other films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings not stereotypical hollywood caricatures what makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine furthermore the the director avoids melodrama the events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of berlin as good as schindler 's list and saving private ryan were this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and this is a milestone in wwii genre of
i became interested in this movie after reading the book ishmael '' by daniel quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book it was a very good movie and anthony hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from ishmael '' there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization there was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization takers '' are mentioned but it comes across more as you just do n't know what you are missing by being one not that all of nature has had it heck the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees but of course that was the main point of ishmael '' if we do n't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature then nature has had it and so have we
this is a good cold war drama after a soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place the race is on to recapture the film as was pointed out in the film the soviets used their german scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from england 's german scientists using a special film developed by the us 's german scientists the film has the location of both side 's missile installations and both sides want it neither side will give an inch the chase takes place with a us nuclear sub overcrowded by marines and spies the problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission the twists and turns do n't stop and neither does the excitement the film is dated but still a good show the photography especially is spectacular especially for that day and age rock hudson leads an all star cast which does a great job across the board
i had to replace my video with this dvd version this movie is spectacular beautiful photography excellent acting and most importantly a tremendous comment on the social restrictions placed on women of the time it is based on the true life of one of the first commissioned female artists in europe artemesia whose father is an artist is forbidden to draw or paint the human body her efforts to do so lead her into difficulties her father is supportive but even he must fight the social structure especially when trying to get her into the art school he finally gets her apprenticed to another talented artist and is devastated when he finds they have engaged in an unlawful '' relationship he files rape charges and everyone suffers a brilliant social commentary
before i saw this sequel i had heard and read that it was a terrible film however be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it 's not as good as the original it 's full of so much humor that you ca n't help but cut it a break i laughed quite a few times and there are a lot of fun moments however the film is a bit uneven the movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard john travolta reprises his role as chili palmer hollywood gangster who now turns his eye to the music business using his negotiation skills '' he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend played by uma thurman and try to get his young singer christina milian a hit record an impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking the best performance is given by the rock and it 's nice to see him in a different type of role vince vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end surprisingly uma thurman gives an average performance and i was expecting more from her john travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull christina milian gives a horrible performance and she 's also not that good of a singer cedric the entertainer gives a good performance though he is n't in the film for very long andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well there are also a bunch of cameos including steven tyler and james wood gary gray directs and he does a poor job he just does n't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess there was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile also at 118 minutes the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots the film needed to be edited badly and it clearly was n't fortunately for the film the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes sometimes the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny compared to the original the sequel does n't measure up well however be cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy in the end be cool is worth a rental and that 's it
i do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena i have watched them all marcus welby right on through er scrubs is the most realistic albiet representation of our professions you can not take everything seriously but if you believe an emergency room can function like er and still have people standing you 're out of touch reality as well
this is a dvd not only for wrasslin ' fans but for all of mankind you will learn the ways of the warrior and hopefully learn something about yourself as well

'' yeah ! i wrote those words ! not another critic yet it 's a true analysis of this fantastic film ! if you loved richard donner 's ladyhawke then timeline 2003 based on the novel by michael crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely ! modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor on the way and in the way are knights of not so good caliber ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there ! my rating of timeline is five stars ! i can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you the viewer to truly enjoy it i 'm not ! when i saw timeline for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful donner production and billy connolly a scot to whom my heart had been lost the character of marek '' gerard butler enslaved me upon my first sight of him ! as creedy '' in reign of fire i 'd fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that i 'd gone to cheer on in the film creedy 's '' torched demise gave me cause to end their existence marek '' is yet another character such as ladyhawkes navarre '' rutger hauer for ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man 's man marek '' is your fellow ! timeline is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to back to the future ! '' this is one film not only well worth the money but well worth the time to view over again and again ! for ladies who despair of a real man keep this one within hand 's grasp at a moment 's notice !

this bbc miniseries has a well earned reputation as being much looser and freer with its literary souce here the source material is not just one work but several works of dh lawrence than most literary adaptations for english television also while most bbc productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and characters in this case the sultry and sophisticated and somewhat libertine in a 1920 's kind of way lady chatterly the earthy and irreverent and smoldering smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class oliver mellors both of these factors can be attributed to director ken russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the bbc 's best programs many of them about musical composers russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking of course most of us in the states know ken russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as tommy 1975 altered states 1979 and gothic 1986 all of which feature lurid dream sequences and some would say gratuitously lewd situations but ken russell is actually a director with many facets and russell 's interest in dh lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best dh lawrence adaptation on film women in love starring glenda jackson oliver reed alan bates he then followed that up twenties years later with the rainbow starring amanda donohoe and sammie davis both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books his additions however were tasteful and even added clarity to the material what is interesting about this new dh lawrence adaptation is that ken russell seems to have remained interested in dh lawrence for so many years and for many of the same reasons dh lawrence more than any other author in the english language or any language for that matter stands for the power of the body and the bodies experience over the power of reason this was the main theme of his earlier dh lawrence adaptations and this is the main theme of his latest but this one is by far the most sensual of the three and that is largely due to the fact that joely richardson seems to be the very embodiment of sensual awakening the actress seems as willing as her character to simply follow the dictates of the body regardless of social norms its always a big deal when a high profile actress especially one with the lineage of joely richardson sheds her clothes on screen but to do so on british televison for all to see takes more than a little boldness the nudity is well done and adds to the allure of this bbc classic no question about that the greatest scene in the entire 4 hour miniseries is not the nudity however but the vision joely has before she ever ventures out to that hut in the woods one night after hearing her blowhard husband lord clifford who cares more for his family estate wragby '' and his class '' than he does about any individual read from socrates about the white horse of reason and the black horse of desire she dreams she is riding through a greek temple full of nude men who seem to be growing like vines out of the stone this is not something that dh lawrence ever wrote this is pure ken russell and yet its the most exciting thing in the whole miniseries plus its the best way to deliver lady chatterly 's state of mind or body to us dh lawrence is actually very wordy for one who claims to be interested in the body more than in the mind but ken russell has found a visual shorthand for delivering those lawrentian themes with nice visuals i only wish there were more moments like this the most sensual acting is done by joely richarson when in her private chambers and russell seems to be keenly aware that it is lady chatterly 's imagination that fires her body after the horse dream connie drapes a veil over her head and walks nude through the house down to lord clifford 's room this scene is more imaginatively and erotically charged than any of the actual love scenes that will follow the actual affair between lady chatterly and oliver mellors is a little odd in fact its very awkward at first they just agree sort of to use each other for sex but of course that never works and soon they are intimates thoroughly engaged with each other body and mind and running naked through the rainy glades and meadows then sitting nake dbefore a fire and pretending to be lady jane and john thomas their understanding '' involves a mutual appreciation of nature and a mutual loathing of lord clifford and the privileges that he defends as birthrights russell gets a lot of mileage out of the racine and proust reading and piano and chess playing lord clifford and his antagonisms toward all those that he perceives to be lower than himself pretty much everyone in the coal mining community that he owns this actor really has fun with this role and russell obviously enjoys his rants because he gives him so many lord clifford is actually a pretty guy in his own way as he does give his wife permission to take a lover but arguably its for selfish reasons he merely wants an heir we certainly pity this wwi vet who must cart himself around in various malfunctioning contraptions metaphors for the mind and its futile tinkerings perhaps what people are reduced to when they no longer have a functioning body but he just wo n't allow anyone to actually like him except his nurse who finds him curiously attractive a plot thread that russell leaves undeveloped he even vents about the lower classes knowing their place '' in the natural '' scheme of things right in front of his house servants russell lingers on the face of one table servant as he does so another striking russell touch no mistaking whose side this film maker is on so this affair of the body between lady chatterly and mellors is actually informed by a social awareness and a mutual understanding and empathy which one could argue is as much about reason as it is about the body in any event we eventually come to accept that these two opposties are drawn to one another for a variety of social and sexual reasons the one perhaps fueling the other lady chatterly 's own father and sister are bohemians so why exactly she was attracted to the repressed snob lord clifford chatterly is a bit of a mystery both her father and sister encourage connie to find lovers but her sister anyway is as much as a snob as lord clifford we 're not certain and we never hear what her father thinks of her affair with the gamekeeper mellors so we never know if the affair has had social repercussions for lady chatterly herself the ending is a bit well i do n't want to give it away suffice it to say that it 's different than the book and it does n't quite resolve those class issues that it raised the answer seems to be leave england perhaps the ending is based on one of lawrence 's short stories in any event ken russell 's creative attitude toward the classics '' is perhaps the most attractive thing about this adaptation i hope his attitude is contagious and will inspire more loose and free treatments of the classics this cultural freedom is refreshing and liberating for mind and body
sure i could have compared phantom quest to a lot of other animes out there but the basic premise is the same we get a group of people who are working together to solve mysteries and there is definitely nothing wrong with that a friend of mine introduced me to this series and i must say that i was pleasantly surprised overall if you love having vampires and mummies among other things show up in your anime along with a huge dosage of humor to boot then you will absolutely love this show it manages to take dark subject matter and make it into something comical i think the biggest weakness in this series is definitely a coherent side story it seems like things are a little too hashed together at times and a little too rushed on top of that half of the phantom quest team only shows up when actually needed to do something such as the team exorcist and the fortune teller neither of these two characters really gets a strong introduction at all one more weakness would really be in the music as well which i found continuously grating on my nerves mainly the theme song most of the other music is just merely complaints aside this is definitely worth your time especially for such a small price buy this one you certainly wo n't regret it
to be honest i think i found this by looking at listmania lists when i was searching for other anime titles i had never heard of it but the reviews seemed good and the price was more than attractive so i decided to give it a shot although i did n't really expect too much boy am i glad i bought it ! the only thing i did n't like about it was that there were only 4 episodes i know this review says pretty much the same thing as all the other reviews but i figured i should throw in my two cents anyway
when i saw this i though why not it does n't look overly violent '' boy am i glad i tried it while there are the usual fight scenes the overriding theme is a wonderful sense of humor as a night owl i adore the morning scenes using different highly original method to awaken the heroine a real keeper and i just wish it was a long series
this is the best way to spend the evening with your children it is very well done and the actors made this a neverland not to forget we have watch it multi times and told eveyone we come in contact to rent it buy it but most of all watch it
i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs and you 're infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again they come up with this idiotic scheme which ended up in disaster both the hilton and auto world closed within a year moore in recent years has become a political celebrity '' in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it 's not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them are n't really interested in changing anything as it might interfere with their livelihoods i do n't know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent darkly funny film about real class warfare and the dismantling of the working class in america
establishmentarian michael moore is mad as hell and he 's not taking it anymore as his smalltown america flint mi has just lost jobs as greedy exects move plant to mexico and put above mentioned thousands out of work moore does a good job of keeping the subject serious for a change other good moore films included fahrenheit 911 and the big one others he 's done get too far into his leftist politics which i am am not into good job here michael
a film about the porn industry in the late 70 's early 80 's great cast great performances great story just a great film unique approach to the subject characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion characters played by julianne moore don cheadle heather graham william macy and burt reynolds respectfully are great to watch this is a performance piece
i love this movie how can you not with such hilarious diologue one of my most favorites is when yzma outlines her first plan to get rid of kuzko ending with a hilarious i 'll smash it with a hammer ! '' but diologue aside there 's so much more to this movie the characters are so wonderfully individual from kuzko to evil yzma with her secret lab '' to dim witted kronk with his shoulder angel and devil secondly look what i can do um i do n't see how that no no he 's got a point over and over agian this movie will keep you laughing watch and enjoy
wonderful to find in the sale just as my tape was wearing movie well acted by all but especially wonderful performance by bridges as the superb print amazon you did it again
frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound this is due to its subject its star and its director julie taymor who also gave us the astounding titus if you have not yet seen titus do so before finishing this review it is an art director 's tour de force on a par with brazil regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum one ca n't help but be intrigued by the fascinating and certainly unconventional people of frida diego rivera played superbly by alfred molina boasted the traditional faults of great artists narcissism thoughtless cruelty obsessive egotism while showcasing some exceptional ones art as propaganda device naive political idealism his flaws were as large as his murals but he was never dull in addition to starring as frida salma hayek the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made how wonderful that she did hayek has traveled under a hollywood curse appearing in one dreadful picture after another this is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by and her performance is note perfect the story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy but hayek never lets that happen her frida is heart and steel all at once amazing the take home message if there is one is that great art is never free in the case of rivera others paid the price he fed off others like a greedy child in the case of frida kahlo she herself paid the price digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave there are moments of magic realism in frida where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were astounding autobiographical statements there are a few missteps the liaisons with trotsky and josephine baker feel almost obligatory as if a form is being filled out but blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments for example when rivera 's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in mexico beyond highly recommended must viewing
we enjoy listiening and watching this dvd on our hdtv we play this when have friends over with the volume low and find them humming or singing along
of all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of allah on that day this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching because of this those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events and perhaps none more so than caesar '' in his review of 17 2006. if only he found at least as troubling the carnage bloodshed and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his islamic buddies against civilian populations but more on this in a bit as regards this extraordinary video from the perspectives of air traffic controllers faa officials norad and neads the air crews and passengers on board each of the four doomed flights to the testimonies of the witnesses participants firefighters and all the heroes on and near ground zero this is the singular documentary that takes you minute by minute through the hell deliberately planned and perpetrated by those whose religion had them believing that the execution of such hellish bloodshed granted them heaven and no this is not the propaganda '' or view of the documentary but instead my own conclusions drawn on many years of personal investigation of islam anyone who like caesar '' here could watch this fully factual account and then call such a splendid documentary propaganda '' try ing to portray the us as good guys being hit by the bad guys '' reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own hatred for so apparently condoning such ghastly horrors as the acts of good guys '' retaliating against bad guys '' while caesar '' how telling a nickname attempts to school us ignorant americans on our country 's past foibles yet he fails to mention the billions in financial and economic aid we have given the islamic nations the millions in military equipment and technical advisory assistance provided them as they struggled against invading soviet forces other foreign enemies attempting to annex and rule over sovereign islamic nations the ousting from kuwait of the brutal armed forces of an islamic fascist dictator who had invaded and then enjoyed '' weeks of the metaphoric and all too literal raping in this tiny islamic nation while openly looting terrorizing butchering torturing and murdering its citizens while none of its islamic neighbors lifted so much as a finger to intervene but instead begged the united nations and the to solve their problems for them which we did ! and these are just a tiny listing of the far greater acts we have done for the cause of justice and good and all of it on islam 's behalf and yet is only the latest and greatest terrorist massacre by which we continue to be repaid by the bloodthirsty religion of islam for all we have done and continue to do on its behalf caesar '' also glaringly omits and all too conveniently ignores radical islam 's history and their policy of religiously motivated bomb blasts hijackings kidnappings tortures rapes gang rapes female circumcisions sawing hacking off people 's limbs and heads mutilations and always mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide including those of their own religion and all thanks to islam 's foundational tenets of blood lust that makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable eternally rewardable and thus forever inevitable true all religions have their radicals and fanatics but none deliberately attract nurture and encourage terrorist fanatics more than does islam and none preaches genocide against the entire jewish and all infidels '' in the name of god more than does islam and it is how this video accurately documents for the entire world only this latest and greatest mass butchery in the name of allah that probably motivates caesar '' most to attempt such blatant propagandizing here and for those who would disagree i challenge caesar '' or anyone else to provide us any reliable evidence of even a single factual error in this documentary what i think caesar '' fears most is that such a powerful documentary as this might add to the growing world view that despite the constant rhetoric of islam as a religion of peace '' the terrorist acts of its leaders and constituents in the name of islamic religion reveal the exact opposite to be the true case maybe it 's just me but i 'm thinking any religion that so encourages its young men to blow themselves up with as many infidels '' as they can so as to spend eternity in orgiastic sex with 72 virgins deserves to be fully prosecuted at the very least on charges of conspiracy to commit mass murder '' ! and one thought that just hit me if more and more islamics continue to either commit or condone such bloodshed and with the full approval of their islamic leaders which god are they truly honoring and emulating allah the creator of life or instead iblis satan the destroyer of it by their fruits are they known after all and on the question of whom and what islamics most worship and adore permit me to close this review as also does this wonderful documentary by quoting one of islam 's most renowned clerics '' we love death the loves life that is the big difference between us '' osama bin laden
wow i watched this on the national geographic channel and i was so astonished at some of the details that i had to buy it it should be a must buy for any library across this country i encouage every american to watch this

in all of the other dvds they show very little on the couple that i like the best kitty and lance the first episode joyride is when lance joins the not everyone is pleased but almost all are scott is the one who hates lance and doese n't believe that lance is doing this out of truth well when cars jets start mysterisoly getting very dirtty scott blames it all on lance but is it lance or is someone else having the joyride and walk on the wild side is a episode very good towards girl power '' jean boom boom rouge magma kitty decide to become the bayville sirens stoping crime and wearing leather in the process the other two epsiodes are worth getting the disc after all any dvd is worth it
now with the release of the version of 'a christmas carol ' i can once again enjoy the antics of the grumpy old ebenezer scrooge as played by reginald owens in my opinion not as good as the later alastair sim version in but all in all a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by the whole family this version is not as dark and scary as the production so if you have a young child you want to introduce to this wonderful christmas story of transformation and redemption for the first time this is definitely the version they should view first one of the essentials for your dvd christmas collection !
this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch even if it does n't feel as audacious as i 'm sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby it is the epitome of all love stories as a old depressive connects with a old woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death as they keep showing up at the same funerals however the root of their respective interests could n't be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive while the harold simply likes the morbidity of it all the plot is really about their burgeoning relationship while his mother constantly attempts to make the harold more socially acceptable first she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates to foil any hope of romance with these women however he stages which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother she then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother victor a hawkish officer and vietnam war amputee to try to convince harold to join the army the episodic structure of the story by collin higgins years before becoming a director in his own right with foul play '' and nine to five '' allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters ' actions the movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone ruth gordon is her typically pixilated self an archetype she played for years afterward while bud cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of cynicism it 's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later there are funny sideline performances by vivian pickles as harold 's mother ellen geer as an overly actressy blind date named sunshine and eric christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest cat stevens ' soundtrack has n't aged as well as say simon and garfunkel 's music in the graduate '' but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings unfortunately the 2000 dvd contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included
this presents us with a visual voyage into music that in my opinion excels that if the original fantasia not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid colorful and highly diverse from segment to segment but the representation of the music is in itself sheer genius as i have come to expect from disney at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure this much i believe is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music
i have to say it took me a while to getting around to seeing this i thought silence of the lambs '' was good it featured a great performance by anthony hopkins and the rest of it was but that was about it as far as i was concerned it just did n't really click with me and it was n't anything near the great movie i 'd been hoping for so when its sequel was released i did n't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released a bit surprisingly though i thought hannibal '' was really great once i finally did see it everyone said it was more geared toward horror than silence '' which is fine by me and it may have been marginally but much more than that it was just a better horror movie than its predecessor and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie in my opinion hopkins is just as good if not better than he was as hannibal lecter the first time around and while i usually do n't like recasting roles in a movie unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you do n't see their real face or hear their real voice and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong julianne moore did a great job stepping into the clarice starling role originally played by jodie foster the movie centers around the hunt to find lecter by the only victim of his original carnage to survive a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against lecter it seems like hannibal '' has changed tract from silence '' and is implying that most if not all of lecter 's victims may have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves whether that 's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible the effect was to create a foil for hannibal who 's even more evil than he is hannibal lecter himself is well he 's not a 'good guy ' in this movie he is though presented in very cryptic shades of grey his behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real and he 's much more interesting as a character this time around clarice also is she comes across here as a character who 's somehow traumatized perhaps even mentally unbalanced deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like lecter to ever see it and that 's what so intrigued him in the first place one possible interpretation of things overall and this is just one of many potential takes on it the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it making it a great source of conversation for is that hannibal lecter is a person who the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil while clarice starling has the potential for great darkness and violence in her but chose to be good chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness a lot of food for thought in this one no pun intended great performances all around in notable addition to hopkins and moore the brilliant gary oldman plays lecter 's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and ray liotta plays an unlikable rather creepy fbi agent who 's constantly at odds with starling a very very engaging and movie
we just got this dvd last week but ever since that time it has remained in the dvd player and has been viewed at least a dozen times by my three year old daughter cassidy she loves this dvd and all the planets that come to life she sings along and has really learned her planets the songs are top notch the dvd is enjoyable for adults even after ten viewings when most kid videos would become painful
moonlighting is one of the greatest series to ever grace television bruce willis and cybill shepherd have a chemistry that just makes the episodes work the scripts are well written funny when they are supposed to be and serious when they are supposed to be all i can say is you should check it out and see for yourself i 'm very happy i decided to buy these dvds
the five people you meet in heaven '' is a powerful book with many mixed emotions this film was a constant mystery as i never knew what would happen next the story is all about the people who affected eddie the most in his life the people he meets in heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking some people he knew and some he had never met this was a great idea mitch albom kept me wanting to read as i usually am not too interested in books this truly is the greatest book i 've ever read and therefore i would definitely recommend it to everyone

federico fellini 's 1972 film is not his best when he has 8 la strada and la dolce vita to his credit while many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless dreamy structure i found it boring and phantasmagorical it is simply fellini 's version of rome and not rome the eternal city itself to risk sounding negative i shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970 's rome the scenes in which the hippies and american tourists invade the city the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off though saying some pretty vulgar things and my favorite the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old roman patricians fade into oblivion but mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot it starts off alright and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences fellini is himself in this movie as well as gore vidal fellini envisions himself as a young man studying rome in his youth in a strict catholic school the shows ancient monuments like the colliseum the apian way trevi fountain and vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman 's behind and later as a young man journeys to rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless vulgar and i found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage ! it bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution brothels or cheap slutty women the cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film and for a film about rome and italy there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater the pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous only serious hardcore fans of fellini will want to own this dvd it is a perfect to his equally absurd and sexually radical satyricon loosely based on the old roman epic
this dvd is the bomb ! why prince puts on a show from morris day and the a must see to the lenny kravitz and prince jam session true prince fans will love seeing his energy and creativity prince is a real performer who puts his heart and soul in every dance move and song as for the spirituality aspect i loved to see that side of him the song he sang was powerful and heartfelt get the dvd you wo n't be disappointed
if you 're even showing an interest to then you most likely own or have seen even then i recommend this one as much as any of them since you got ta watch the whole series in order to find out what happens in the end anyways offers the same fun antics the vol did but unfortunately when compared to you 'll see that there are a whole lot less sword fights and basically no violence at all any sword fighting that actually occur usually does n't last long enough to be considered a fight '' but this dvd makes up for that with plenty more comical antics than the vol so enjoy it i know i did
you got ta get the whole series ca n't just get one or two dvds you need the whole thing trust me once you start you got ta go all the way to the end
this movie is worth owning it 's a classic tale well done and very entertaining
this is a great kid 's movie with a lot of characters and a great story plot it 's a good combination of a musical and a story with good characters and characters that do not make good choices SMILE i would suggest not over thinking the story line it 's a kid 's movie after all and no its not all about the flying cars believe me even a two year old is capable of appreciating more !
this is a classic musical that i grew up watching on network tv it has the great love story for the girls and the cool gaget car for the boys i bought it to share with my kids and they loved it
i did n't watch this one before because of all the hype too many buddy comedies were coming through the pipe this one caught me by surprise it really was first rate two dudes who 're crashing weddings so they 'll always have a date party animals with very rigid rules break it off before sunrise commitment 's just for fools until one day one falls in love the other falls in lust if you want to see vince vaughn get hurt then this one is a must sometimes sappy sometimes sweet and often lewd and loud but it does n't stoop to flatulence so it stands out from the crowd amanda richards november 5 2006

i was just gon na watch the film because i think robert de niro is one of the greatest actors ever but then the film takes on a behind the scenes of being black that truly adds another factor to this 's a trip out film
this movie has recieved several bad reviews and i can understand that this movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical first gay love movie '' but if you like movies that are not this one if a must have the movie is not a hardcore sex movie in fact there is only one scene of sex in the movie the positives of this movie are it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love one that does n't turn out in the same way other movies portray again i only recomend this movie to people who enjoy complex movies and are not looking for just hardcore sex
i love this movie while the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film she 's all that '' does n't go overboard and surprisingly presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata after zach the class president and soccer star is very publically dumped by his magically delicious '' and equally popular girlfriend taylor he 's hard put to maintain his legacy though a little slow zach 's friend dean bets him that he ca n't replace taylor and make any girl prom queen enter laney boggs an art student who cares little about the social scene dean picks laney as zach 's prom queen project '' and zach has a hard time convincing laney to even go out with him meanwhile taylor the ex is dating a real world reject who she met over spring break but she 's still catty over her discards '' and is horrible to laney embarassing her at a party the more time zach spends with laney the more he starts to like her and laney begins to open up and finds a real outlet in her art dean sensing he might be about to lose the bet asks laney to prom before zach gets around to it and a recently single taylor attaches herself to zach 's arm assuming he 'll take her back ultimately feelings are hurt battle lines are drawn and a really cool dance scence takes place at the prom i love the fresh comedy in the movie that is amusing for teens without being impractical or raunchy the characters are and actually evolve in a realistic fashion even if you are left wondering how zach ever dated taylor vaughn there 's really nothing comparable to the teen movies like sixteen candles '' or pretty in pink '' because those are genres unto themselves but she 's all that '' is definitely a nice representation of a good modern teen movie
what more could a true parrotthead ask for than jimmy buffett live at wrigley field this dvd set captures the truly historic concert from chicago jimmy and the band put on a great show it makes you feel as though you were part of the show the bonus coverage is not to be miseed the time lapse of setting up the stage is fun to watch and the banner performance rivals jimi hendrix this is a must for any music lover but the true parrottheads will definitely need to add it to their collection
i have always enjoyed watching this movie with so many great stars some whom are no longer with us never owned it on video now i have it on dvd great price too ! ! it was worth it

this is like the classic that killed other classics for some reason this is around the time when characters started dying off more in anime so anime was never the same around this time based off the manga loosely i mean some parts are changed or edited over here the manga was rare so try it if you like this type of animation still one of my favorites in terms of anime classics beware this is a type of movie that will kick you in your face and start to laugh a very hyper violent film lot 's of action !
this film was originally titled the testimony of taliesin jones it is named for the hero a little welsh boy whose mother leaves his farm family for a life in town his experiences are touching and seem to involve a gift of healing delightful beautiful deserves to be better known than it is

i was given the special fan remix '' edition of this film last christmas and i must say the bonus features only detract from the wonderful original so stick with the original
after buying the original the fast and the furious '' i found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it however i can now say i am a fan of the trilogy all 3 films are good lucas black is simply the man and gives another great performance here bow wow does a surprisingly good job as well car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie which i am neither this is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy
michael into the sun '' '' space fury '' nancy allen limit up '' robocop '' two famous star in 80 's made this a movie but no subtitle or closed captioned so i will give it 4.5 star
i am very disappointed with this movie the philadelphia experiment '' that have no english subtitles due to my deafness i was planning to buy this dvd i have seen it many times in late and have been waiting for the english subtitles since
this dvd takes some of the funniest episodes from the series the dvd is put together quite well and episodes are taped better than vhs the only problem is with 1 or 2 episodes it splits for a quick second but i would recommend to anyone who like any lucille ball items
i love leslie sansone 's videos she 's quirky and a bit ditzy '' but her workouts are always easy to follow and fun this is no exception there have been previous complaints about her cues not being good enough but i had absolutely no even on my first try if you do n't want to miss a beat pay close attention at you 'll hear the directions i bought this because i loved walk and jog so much walk and kick is not quite as intense but it still works up a sweat for a day where you 're not working quite as hard this is a great workout for people interested in a bit of kickboxing but not for experience kickboxers i also saw complaints about leslie saying some silly things about the size of her nose dusting the floor etc this is classic leslie chatter and i personally think it makes the workout go faster if you do n't like the chatter of her other videos you wont like this one as an avid watp video user i give this one a big thumbs up
excellent pay per view one of the best of 2002. here 's the matches 1 elimination table match 3 minute warning rico jeff hardy bubba ray and spike dudley great opener lots of high spots included for pounders 3 minute warning really can move surprise ending 2 cruiserweight championship jamie noble champion billy kidman both looked impressive during the match putting on a superb bout watch for noble 's sick ddt and kidman aerial moveset 3 hardcore match for women 's championship trish stratus champion victoria a solid women 's division match tons of weapons but a weak finish victoria supposedly injured her acl in this match but i could n't find the spot maybe you can 4 wwe championship brock lesnar champion big show of course brock was able to suplex the big show and brock was able to get him up for the which paul heyman doubted the match unfolded quickly and equipped a strong end 5 wwe tag team championship elimination match edge rey mysterio champions kurt angle chris benoit los guerreros using a tag title bout as a match did n't pay out well rey possessed an intense aereal arsenal compared to his present one worth watching 6 world championship elimination chamber match triple h champion kane chris jericho rob van dam booker t shawn michaels i was hoping someone would bring the match atop the chamber but was disappointed and the fact that jericho was a world tag team champion at the time puzzled me since christian his partner was n't even on the show besides that a great main event rvd nearly crushed triple h 's throat at one point jericho knew how to work an elimination chamber at perfectly overall for survivor series 2002. worth buying
i found the movie to be very creative and unique i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage for a play would be i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed greed true love spirituality determination issues and jealousy i am not a prince fan but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them clever i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won
sybil is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public the performances by sally field and joanne woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter child abuse and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques both the book and the movie became musts for students of abnormal psychology at that time and for decades afterwards joanne woodward reverses her roles from the three faces of eve '' to portray cornelia wilbur with consummate skill while sally field 's performance as sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another the movie works with thirteen of the book 's sixteen personalities without being overtly graphic the movie conveys all of the horrors of sybil 's childhood with an incredible impact the rest of the cast is excellent with martine bartlett 's hattie '' sybil 's mother in the chilling forefront and natasha ryan as little sybil close behind the real sybil unaware that sally field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with joanne woodward let it be known that she wanted stewart stern and daniel petrie to try and get sally for her part from the extras bonus disk i ca n't recommend the movie and the book enough to students of human behavior and psychology whether for personal of professional interests it took hollywood 30 years to try remaking the film which should indicate how high the bar was set by this original cast and production
this is my first watp video but i started at the highest mile because i am an exerciser so i knew i needed something high intensity to get my heart rate going but mostly i was looking for variety in my workout and i must say i just love this video it is the only video i own that makes me want to do it i truly enjoy working out but when i find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up i know i hit the jackpot this workout can be perfect for most exercisers although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the super challenge leslie is a good instructor but as most have mentioned she does talk quite a bit and has a very annoying laugh but its about the workout not the sound of her voice and in that watp super challenge accomplishes alot i hope to buy more of her videos in the future
as an american i find this video showing the incredible distruction and the first responders who are operating at the scene of this enormous tragedy compelling to think that this terrorist attack actually happened on our soil is truly unbelievable another reviewer from france states that the footage is nothing special ! that is the furthest from the truth ! i guess the he believes that the terrorist attack never took place ! this is an historic document that should be seen by every american !
this is a great video my daughter learned all her abc 's with the letter factory and now she is learning words and she is not even two yet ! go leap frog

this is easily one of the best films of the 80 's kevin bacon is a god in this movie he plays a total renegade that swigs booze and dances like the devil when the footloose song comes on the radio my tom and i cant help but busting into dance its films like this that can make you feel good and drunk with happy feet ! ! buy this dvd for your collection and you 'll be bursting into dance before u know it !
an animated family of complete with spandex it all turns out pretty well incredible pixar and disney have made six exceptional films together but i find myself reaching for this one almost every time needless to say superhero films are no longer novelties yet this film seems to have new angles on seemingly cliched themes the lawsuits that put the supers '' out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives brad bird who wrote and directed the incredibles '' some unexplored avenues to try which he does and it turned out well pretty incredible ! what it 's all about first we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as supers '' and instead turns into average american after the lawsuits that ended the supers '' crime fighting dynasty along the way they had three very different yet super '' offspring ! wow that 's enough right there to keep us busy we also have which include each one of the 3 children 's coming of age in a super '' way but as ordinary kids the kids like their parents struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family we have bob parr incredible going through what appears to be a crisis and his confused wife helen who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else but after all how can elastigirl '' be just another soccer mom we have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan buddy who turns the incredibles '' lives and for the first time the supers '' are the underdogs ! everything that follows satisfying family issues much more after these elements are set into motion we have everything that follows and it is fascinating to see all the incredibles ' family issues worked out like any other family 's but with many interesting twists the incredibles '' is a super film ! dvd features anamorphic widescreen very widescreen digital to digital transfer is the sharpest i have seen yet ! lots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did the attack '' is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between '' and the i just wish it was longer the behind the scenes featurettes '' are worth watching as are the blooper scenes though they seem a bit contrived there are two commentary tracks one with brad bird and john walker producer and another with the animators i could not watch the entire movie with either track on maybe you can the files about the supers '' are interesting there is lots more if you like to go in for it you can spend the day with the features alone for me however there is the film this is the best animated film in my opinion and is perfect for all members of the family of all ages to connect with in a family sort of way
it 's interesting to read some of the other reviews i ca n't understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie it 's imaginative as was nightmare before christmas '' but goes beyond that movie with even better animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving i loved nightmare '' but corpse bride takes all the things i loved and made them better the voices of all the actors ring true the mood is gothic and yet comical the score is rich and defines the movie perfectly the dvd allows you to watch the movie with only the music and that 's a real plus
awesome ! bought for my husband for valentine 's day ! even our 8 year old son loved it excellent condition
great story great actors beautiful scenery and colors my favorite movie
student of history '' is a student of christian biased history there are plenty of qualified scholars and current book like that of theologian bart ehman for one who show that early christianity was based on forged documents that claimed earlier pedigree but were written by ambitious men who sought to dominate a very wide spead of ideas about who and what those events in judea were about not paliestine ! the romans named the region palestine after the war against the jews in the fact that one man constantine sought a single authoritive finality was a political move not an act or miracle of god '' authority of apostles is more christian myth and power assertion not historical proof of the varacity of the bible and christian claims objective scholarship has shown for example that a church father probably iraneus forged copies of josephus by adding the paragraphs that refer to jesus it is easy to understand when we remember that typewriters and copy machines did not exist then ! handwriting is sort of a especially when other earlier copies exist with no insets about jesus what is known about the gospel of thomas and other second century altnative christian texts is that they were warred against by the eventual winner it might have gone otherwise and then people like you would be claiming a completely different set of circumstances as facts people with no authority like iraneus wrote tracts condemning any other view than his own and those of his small cult he called arius of alexander for example a heretic but he had no authority to do so he forged documents to prove it never realizing that in the future others would also forge whatever they found expedient to make reality for believers paul called it lying to bring you the truth '' but a lie is a lie and historians ca n't make lies facts so the yoke of bias due to conditioned belief must be thrown off if one is to be a true historian and seeker of truth the real key '' to the entire mystery and the inspiration for all of these writers is the nagging reality of the original parchments found by the real life priest beringer saunier in 1891 in i have been there several times the original parchments are kept in a vault in london at a loyd 's bank the copies have been studied by many and here is the problem for the debunkers when a fraud is being perpetuated code puzzles are invariably simple and unsophisticated experts agree that the codes on the parchments are so sophisticated that they would have had to have been created by a very intelligent individual a genuis everything can be argued down for lack of enough solid evidence if you wish to prefer christian myths like virgin birth death and resurrection actually earlier pagan myths but the parchments remain a piece of evidence that no un objecive debunker likes to talk about dan brown has made the subject popular again by writing a book and making a film that tantilizes the minds of many people he also gives the public a new level of nonsense to wade through and a rich source of psuedo history for debunkers to feast upon pretending to extend their claim to truth by turning over toys in a kindergarten class if you are going to claim to be a student of history you must be objective and ready to accept what is there not select what suits you and if you want to answer the many very quesitonable claims of chrisitanity and the claimed history of the faith then you must be willing to question the premises once you do that you will find that there is plenty to support doubt just knowing about the catholic destruction of previous historic and relgious records along with anyone who opposed them ought to clue the thinking person that something is up with tradtional christian western history on its face dan brown and and to a greater extent leigh baigent and lincoln have a lot more material than that planted and represented by pierre plantard the discussion of the biblical evidence itself is compelling without ever having pierre plantard at all why is there a large tradition of all people extant at the time that simon of cyrene was crucified not jesus muslims claim this today and christian freemasons are aware of the source i have seen it myself and if we really want to be factual about it there never was a jesus christ in judea paul created his church in greece and the hellenized region of asia minor jesus christ '' is greek if there was a character that jesus was based on his name would have been josua ben joseph and his brother james '' would be jacob if you dig in you will find no basis for a person named jesus exists and the probability that the jesus christ character was only paul 's creation based on another person who was crucified as a rebel by the romans and whose sect venerated his death as a memorial that became part of their sect of judiasm one book of found in the dead sea scrolls is the book of enoch freemasons have owned a copy of it and it is tracable to at least 1717 when the grand lodge in london announced itself how does a book that only became known to the public when the closely guarded srolls were finally made public in the already exist among a society of brotherhood that can be traced to the knights templar this is not myth but a sample of factual connections one can make if they objectively study the quesitons culling out the fluff and theory from fact for 20 years as i have i did n't just read i traveled it takes a long time to verify or debunk a historical claim or theory these people who study the subject for a year and then write a book amuse me but very well i completely enjoyed the film the da vinci code even though i could not read the book because i knew too much of the where he got his ideas from to read it leigh richard leigh teabing michael baigent and the gm of the priory named sauniere there is a code for begginers in the book but i am no beginner still i found the film enjoyable and i even thought the book is a good thing because i am a bit like the leigh teabing character in the da vinci code i believe that a lie even to build a faith is a lie and overall the worse will come from it histoy shows that to be true religions are built on lies made for the purpose of power and control over others what we witness now in the world is more of that with more and worse to come it is probably useless but only when people can know the real truth and throw off the superstition and neurosis of religion including and especially christianity but all others as well will the human race have a chance to become something besides a mass of ants bent of self destruction if there is any use for the historian it must be to serve as a witness and a warning how long will we repeat history as long as we insist on institutionalizing lies and myth in the meantime established christian indluence and owned media produce airy debates quoting the bible and it 's own set of biblical facts as ultimate fact because they have n't yet gone to the bottom of the scholarly bebate and do n't want to
i have loved this movie since i first it back in the early 1990 's in all honesty it is pretty crudy but that 's what i love about it the music is fantastic and the costumes are unique divine truly shines as he usually does in any roles he played in and ricki lake was perfect for the role link is pretty hunky too
i never tire of this film the acting the marvelous filming locations the costumes perfection i ca n't watch it without wanting to have a cup of tea and a hot scone to accompany the viewing in fact i once stopped the video baked scones and continued to watch it while munching a freshly baked scone and a cuppa try it i now own the dvd also
i have no idea why i had never heard of this movie before because ronin is a whale of a good film i can take or leave most action films but give me a taut intelligent suspenseful thriller filled with great action wicked twists and some of the best footage you 'll ever see and i 'm happy throw jean reno and the one and only robert de niro into the mix as well and i 'm happier than any clam has a right to be director john frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone does n't make for a good action film and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene the title is derived from the term for masterless samurai of feudal japan warriors who failed their master and were left to wander in the shame of their failure in modern parlance and in this movie the term applies to special agents of various governments who find themselves quite on their own thanks to the end of the cold war these men still put their skills to good use by selling their services to those willing to pay them for handling sensitive usually dirty jobs in this case sam de niro vincent reno and three others are brought together in france by an irish lass named deirdre and charged with acquiring a metal case by its current carrier it sounds easy ambush the target and his security force snatch the case exchange it for cash and move on naturally the mission turns out to be extremely complicated as a couple of powerful parties want whatever is in that case and a certain individual proves less than trustworthy what 's the world coming to when you ca n't even trust a selfish de niro has to run over and shoot up half of france before everything gets resolved in this film the only problem i had with this movie came in the form of the thick accents of some of the characters especially the irish ones you may want to use closed captioning at times to really understand everything that is said the actors themselves though were quite good especially de niro and reno who make a great team as for the mix of bad guys how about three count 'em three former adversaries of james bond michael lonsdale sean bean and jonathan pryce not only that the script is worthy of all these fine actors as i 've mentioned already though the chase scenes are really the most memorable aspect of this film frankenheimer does n't have any use for these new digital means for manufacturing this kind of action instead treating the viewer to several good thrill rides through the streets of paris and its local environs besides filming an incredible number of scenes live he also chose to forego the accompaniment of a musical score in these situations letting the revving engines squealing brakes and numerous crashes and explosions present the action as authentically as possible they had to have had an incredible number of stunt drivers and stunt men involved as folks were constantly crashing or jumping out of the path of oncoming cars not to mention the extended high speed chase down streets into busy oncoming traffic i 'm telling you these chase scenes are impressive obviously i think ronin has it all without de niro it still would have been a fantastic film with him it 's a in my book
the bells of mary 's '' was a shrewd move by paramount studios and director leo mccarey whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical catholic priest father o'malley going my way '' spawned the 1945 release which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict irish catholic mccarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed going my way '' and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the catholic world inhabited by father o'malley bing crosby had garnered a best actor oscar for going my way '' and mccarey secured the services of the beautiful ingrid bergman to play sister benedict the mother superior of mary 's school crosby found himself immediately clashing with bergman on certain points relating to the parish but through it all a mutual respect existed between them each realized that the other was committed to the best interests of mary 's dudley nichols a best original screenplay academy award winner a decade earlier for the john ford film about the irish political conflict starring victor mclaglen the informer '' directed his effort in the script toward presenting crosby and bergman in periodic conflict but learning from those experiences much of the contrast they realize stems from the way that men and women view situations one phase of the film showing this difference is when bergman teaches a young student who has been victimized by a bully how to box as a means of restoring order she feels a tinge of guilt since the youngster 's failure to fight back and receipt of a beating in the process stemmed from his obedience to her stricture against fighting at mary 's when crosby pursues a conventional macho posture in extolling the need for protecting oneself and praises the fighting skills of the bully the nun has had enough she purchases a boxing instructional book written by former heavyweight champion gene tunney and adeptly instructs the obedient youngster in the manly art of as he ultimately teaches the bully a lesson crosby recognizes her teaching skill and becomes cognizant of the strength of her feminine viewpoint an area where crosby and bergman cooperate is in seeking the answer to the nun 's fervent prayer she believes that of the mortgage holder of their property henry travers who has built a modern building next door and seeks to use the church property for an employee parking lot may through prayer and proper persuasion be convinced to give them his modern structure the result would be a new school and no further need to use the tired current facility the effectiveness of crosby and bergman stems from their soft sell technique with just the right pinch of christian charitable thought thrown into the mix travers who can not sleep nights and experiences heart problems confides to the priest and nun separately that he wishes he was better liked their soft sell approach in advancing the it is more blessed to give than to receive '' precept along with the accompanying feel good element of charity prompts travers to see things in a light more favorable to the interests of mary 's crosby and bergman are delights to behold in this feel good film they provide challenges to each other through disagreement and an effective front when they team up on the issue of greatest importance to them the welfare of mary 's parish

how many times have you watched an exercise video hosted by a bouncy perky blonde with a plastic smile making you feel like a fat lazy slob or maybe it was an arrogant hollywood trainer with that fitter than thou '' sneer these instructors just do n't seem like real people with real lives outside the gym do they well ana caban is different she has a warm relaxed presence with grace borne of years of ballet she explains the moves thoroughly without talking down to the viewer and she gives the impression that she does pilates because she likes the results not because she is an exercise fanatic the exercises are geared toward the beginner yet offer enough of a challenge to keep you busy for a while when you 've mastered the beginner workout she also leads an intermediate workout which offers greater challenges but the familiarity of ana 's friendly demeanor i have a hard time making myself exercise but when it comes to buckling down and choosing something to do for myself this is the dvd i pop in the machine i 've purchased several exercise tapes and dvd 's over the years but this one has definitely seen the most use
witch hunter robin is a great series which i enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series the visuals are first rate the music when there is music is beautiful and the storyline is intriguing silence and extended stares cloak the characters in mystery so what 's the problem that same cloak covers the series in what could potentially be a series of yawns one of the major problems with witch hunter robin is the pace many serious animes either take themselves too seriously or not seriously enough whr takes itself much too seriously surely the story and visuals are worth it but for some reason there are long tiring sequences during the course of the series which are supposed to be meaningful '' they are i suppose in retrospect one will notice this once they watch the final episodes of whr but the events in the series do not warrant such extended periods of self reflection on the part of the main character s the psychological and philosophical themes present are obvious toward the end of the series and where they are not the intelligent viewer can pretty much guess at them i realize that this exhausted review of whr seems to only be about the tiresome pace at which the series progresses but it 's an important factor as it leaves many to simply drop the series half way before ever seeing the later episodes the best episodes in my opinion a second problem is also the fact that there are a number of witch capturing '' which take place during the series that seem well silly the beginning of the series is all about these capturing surely after seeing the last couple of episodes the viewer begins to understand how this ties into rounding out the characters but during the course of the series this might just bore you to tears especially if a number of episodes feature that simply do n't interest you which they may not the creativity and design behind many of them is poor to say the least in the end the series is about the characters story and visuals not the enemies which frequently populated much of the series if you find yourself hooked on the main characters and their when they are introduced in the beginning of the series then you might like the whole thing lastly as for reviewers that were expecting something scary '' most of the shows on adult swim are for adults and the anime shows featured on adult swim are geared toward those typically interested in other things beside quick thrills needless to say those watching the series probably are n't into it because the name of the series is witch hunter '' they are instead hopefully looking for a high quality cohesive anime this is not for individuals wanting to watch an action anime however it 's more of a beautiful drama younger anime viewers are not bound to like this one at all ! ! ! i 'd give it a try first renting it before you go out and spend money on it !
season 1 of millennium '' featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made the '' look sunny by comparison unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a murder mystery of the week '' fare thankfully the second season supervised by former '' producers glen morgan and james wong changed all that the second season began with the suspenseful 'beginning and the end ' where frank black pursues the mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife this episode also introduces the comic relief for season two computer hacker brian roedecker even though 'the beginnning and the end ' would fit perfectly in season 1 the subsequent episodes follow a different path that greatly improved the series starting with the second episode 'beware of the dog ' and continuing with episodes such as 'the hand of sebastian ' 'owls ' 'roosters ' and the haunting season finale 'the fourth time is now ' we find out that the millennium group has existed since the beginnings of christianity and is n't nearly as altruistic as frank black and the viewers originally suspected in addition to the millennium group storyline we also learn more about frank 's childhood via two holiday episodes 'the curse of frank black ' a tale where frank encounters the ghost of a neighbor who committed suicide and 'midnight of the century ' an emotional story of frank trying to mend the relationship between him and his father in the latter we find out that frank was not the only one with a strange gift as his mother was with the ability to see angels lastly the second season even showcased two comedy episodes 'jose chung 's doomsday defense ' and 'somehow satan got behind me ' these hours of television are completely different from the average millennium '' episode to say the least but they 're still worth a look nonetheless i could continue rambling on and on about the greatness of season two but you 'll really have to buy the dvd set and form your own opinions the dvd set does come with some bonus features but the only one of worth is the season two documentary turning of the tide '' the rest of the bonus materials are at best
one of the most maligned movies of 2004 is not that bad in a fine example of how critics and hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it oliver stone delivers an epic take on the life of alexander the great not up to par with the great hollywood epics but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe the incredible life of alexander the great is epic movie material if i 've ever seen any his rise to ruler of the world by his mid twenties is chronicled here with noticeable gaps in the timeline his personal life is just as fascinating as his public one his decidedly odd family life as depicted by stone anyway and his lovers both male and female are just as integral to the story as his military victories perhaps the ultimate momma 's boy just wanted to be loved alexander is a workable and sometimes fascinating historical epic it certainly does n't deserve the drubbing it got in the press wonderful cinematography and a fascinating subject are undermined by uneven performances and some poor storytelling decisions but there 's a lot to like i 'll take my history this way instead of as an over sentimentalized bit of claptrap like the patriot or pearl harbor any day forget the buzz and check it out rent it if like me you find much to enjoy there are plenty of copies on any used dvd rack give it a chance and make the decision for yourself my bet is you 'll find a lot to appreciate

this movie is going to bring you down that 's a fact but it 's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves a classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man it 's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the u boat service

the movie one of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90 's and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind and despite the whining from some usually hardline christian corners it 's not at all what it is is simply great imaginative and clever film making and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from mimi rogers ably supported by the likes of david duchovny will patton and patrick bauchau i 'm not going to go into it too deeply simply because it 's one of those films that should be seen and experienced with as little up front knowledge as possible please note that i 'm not attacking christians or christianity above just a small but as usual vocal closed minded minority that always gets up in arms about any film that dares tackle any such subject with any degree of honesty instead of going down the traditional biblical fawning path people who will instantly hate a film like this just on principle '' and then proclaim to all that they should avoid such trash '' you know exactly the kind of people i 'm talking about they 're a minority they just happen to be a very vocal and closed minded one and none of that has anything to do with their christianity as much as it has to do with their absolute closed mindedness and their fear of anything that dares stray from a certain comfortable path the dvd the good news this film is finally on dvd and with a pretty decent audio commetary to boot the bad news the movie has been badly misframed which is something that becomes obvious in a couple of key scenes especially i 'm not sure whether this was done as a form of censorship as the misframing of one scene does effectively nullify a sequence of any real nudity that it once had or whether it was just a botched transfer but it is clearly misframed regardless as i saw this film twice on it 's theatrical run and the framing is different now than it was then plus the misframing is quite obvious anyway and on the audio commentary you can even hear remarks about the film pertaining to parts of the print that are no longer visible due to said misframing so clearly they were watching the film in it 's proper framing unfortunately this does n't appear to be available anywhere else on dvd so if you want the film on dvd right now this is your only option just be aware going in and hope for a better release somewhere down the track apart from the framing issue the sound and audio quality are perfectly fine and the only other notable extra is the film 's trailer the bottom line a really good bold interesting film on a disappointing and variable quality dvd mr j
there are many reviews here and i believe in their own way they all are right about this film to some degree my main recommendation is to be sure to watch it more than once if you do it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place daniel once again makes this film you feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the wrong woman '' pfeiffer after being engaged to the right woman '' ryder he is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film due to circumstances beyond his control he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman there is a palpable underlying eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by and pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair after i had watched this film one time primarily due to i had decided to give it away i left it alone for about 2 weeks and then watched it again since then i have watched it several times and i enjoy it more and more with each viewing my only real complaint i hate the blond hair they gave pfeiffer it 's just all wrong for her nevertheless she is so beautiful take the time to watch this at least two times if you do i think you 'll find it 's a keeper
after the original herbert west jeffery combs and dan cain bruce abbot have returned from medical miltary duty in south america as they return back home as they have perfected their formula to continue experimentint but herbert however gets an idea to collect body parts especially the heart of cain 's old girlfriend meg '' to create the perfect woman however carl hill david gale has been back to life by accident as he still has powers to control zombies and want revenge for what west did to him not as great as the 1985 cult horror comedy masterpiece '' but really enjoyable ! the acting is kind of average but there 's nice splatter in this movie including a variety of odd critters like a finger creature with a human eye attached done by screaming mad george david allen puppet master q the winged serpant and young sherlock holmes like the original movie this has dark humor to propell along with gruesomeness all in all is that it 's not a bad but still worth watching this dvd is pratically bareboned with a alright transfer with no trailer ! but that 's ok if you enjoyed the original then you 'll probably like this one as well
this show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal from the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i 've been a huge fan of the series i was so sad to hear it 'd been cancelled but i was n't surprised it was one of the shows i loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air now that the dvds are out i can relive these 13 fleeting moments in tv that are to me some of the funniest things i 've ever seen apart from the hilarious oddball performances from michael michael and david the series was packed with guest stars including edward norton paul rudd and a whole lot more really anyone that is a fan of comedy ala strangers with candy will find this funny it has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts favorite episodes include campaign paper route coffee shop novel meeting girls and vegetables the extras on the dvd are really top notch including commentary tracks for every episode a lengthy and interesting history of stella '' and much more the commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other giving some insight into the creation process while remaining pretty well aware their show met with ratings they take it all in stride and are n't too proud to poke fun at themselves i think if this show had been on comedy central around the time strangers with candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons it 's a shame definitely worth getting turning off your phone and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season and when i say plow that 's a pun !
excellent series the court room scene is hilarious i am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti americanism of this series i refer to the portrayal of the american guest as well as in upstairs downstairs in both series as in other british tv dramas americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic what about the henry wharton type aristocrats who toured england in the century hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them when will series 2 be released
if you 're a fan of vampires werewolves action or gothic suspense this is probably a movie you 'd be interested in checking out while it 's not a groundbreaking film it 's a highly entertaining one and one that for me is something i can rewatch several times per year the filming is very attractive everything is dark yet not so dark you ca n't see what 's going on the movie has a gothic look to it from the sets to the costumes to the lighting please do n't mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle the music mostly heavy rock fits in well with the movie and the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch the movie uses several techniques made popular by the matrix '' but who cares it works perfectly within this movie the only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor there 's not a single joke in the entire thing ! everything is so serious and dark that unless you 're in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down that 's how heavy it is as for the set the added scenes provide more insight and the special features are a treat especially the documentary fang fiction '' which talks about vampires and werewolves it was very intriguing if you 're a fan of this movie and you own the dvd already i would recommend selling it and buying this version it 's worth the money
this is the best animal movie i have ever a child 's point of view this has been our daughter 's favorite movie for the last one year or so she 's 3 now and after watching it almost every day sometimes several times a day she still enjoys it as much ! we 're surprised that even we are not tired of it the animals are fun to watch the story is interesting and the music is great we 've bought several other animal movies for our daughter and this surpasses all of them the production is superb the animals did a great job and it all seems so real a for everyone who has small kids
as i understand it police squad '' was one of the most requested titles for release on dvd it 's taken a while for it to happen but it finally has ! it 's great to be able to replace my vhs tape that i recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a police squad '' marathon having now watched the dvd i now know that for almost 20 years i 've been watching heavily edited versions of the show but not anymore ! other reviewers have described the episodes so i wo n't waste time doing that suffice it to say the show was ahead of its time as it really did n't become popular until it was made into the first naked gun movie 6 years later and had two subsequent hit sequels but i was one of the few who knew in 1982 that it was a clsassic i always wondered why the show never worked on tv but leslie nielsen probably explains it best in his interview that is included on the dvd he says that you actually had to pay attention and most tv is meant to be watched almost passively while doing something else and i think he 's right so it 's great to have these shows the extras are just as the interview with nielsen is too short and i do n't think the commentaries give much to the episodes especially the one commented on by robert wuhl of arliss '' fame who was a writer for the show wuhl must say a dozen times i do n't remember this '' might have helped bob if you took 25 minutes to watch it before watching it for the commentary but i wo n't trim the rating it 's the shows i wanted and have now received
the full frame version is just that the unmatted full frame of the filmed image the widescreen version is simply the full frame matted with black bars to fit a wide theater screen this is how it was originally shown in theaters in two spots the dvd lies about the full frame version saying that it 's a pan scan trimming of the widescreen picture 1 the frame menu screen which comes up when the disc boots up and also when you select video setup '' from the main menu this screen shows a screen capture of a film frame that appears at in the movie the capture was taken from the widescreen matted version of the film and the full frame '' image displayed is simply a cropped version of the widescreen image 2 the text the following film has been modified from its original version it has been formatted to fit this screen '' which appears before the full frame version of the movie is played mgm got themselves into trouble for this very same lie on their dvd packaging
season 1 wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit incredible acting for a tv series and classic plots all around a great opening season for a classic show season 2 great story lines very different plots thickening of the chemistry between remington and laura with lots of moments the addition of mildred krebs in season 2 was the best move that the show producers made season 3 tops the first two seasons it 's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting the most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great classic show laura stephanie and remington pierce are really just starting to get into the groove of their relationship and mildred doris is just starting to blossom as an actual gumshoe '' it is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons the good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them i would highly recommend purchasing seasons because i 've seen them already as well as the final set of discs seasons 4 5 even though i have not yet watched them i 'm trying to drag it out and make the show last longer ! one major not with the show itself but with the dvd discs is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs stopping completly skipping to the end or back to the beginning skipping chapters etc one disc will not even play in our computer which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax it 's too bad that they do n't take more care transfering great shows like this to quality dvd 's for years of enjoyment the same disc did n't have as much trouble playing in our actual dvd player once we were back in the states but still skipped from time to time overall show rating 5 stars overall disc rating 3 stars
dark atmospheric telling of the tale very decent ! it is a simply told ancient tale the scenery is gorgeous there 's a good atmosphere of the barbaric time it 's a good movie a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end the movie conjures up thoughts of gerard butler as aragorn and ingvar eggert as theodin in lotr
i loved this movie for those who gave it one star i guess didnt see how well it was done in the american version all it sarah michelle gellar 's face the japanese version was much better considering it was original and made more sense it has alot of characters in it but not so much that u will get lost in all of them since they usually die or just dont appear until later in the has some twists which are american leaves out soo sooo much in the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people in the japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves asian horror and likes a good plot and movie ! ! go see it ! ! and enjoy
this film gets 4 stars because the child actors shine so much in it the plot is not very intriguing and you know that nothing like this can happen in the real life so it lacks this sense of reality a dearly beloved child by perfect parents can never turn out to be a killer which is exactly the point of this movie however this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute elijah wood is stunning only due to his efforts can the film get some believability caulkin is perfect in this role too portraying the bad boy i have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor maybe only comparing to elijah but hey he is widely consirered as one of the most talanted actors of his generation and the most talanted holywood child star ever so no wonder you can not compete with him anyway this film is certainly worth watching as a family entertainment and is absolutely a must for elijah wood fans !
in all fairness this film is advertized on the package as a docudrama '' and not as a drama the problem is that it is n't clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its anniversary as a documentary about the reenactment this is a fine collection of footage interspersed with some thankfully brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides actually i thought the actor portraying longstreet did a fine job the others were less convincing as a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle as a reenactor i found it interesting watching the various units on the field despite the occassional glimpse of earplugs and sunglasses the equipment and uniforms appear reasonably authentic of course given the generous build of most of the reenactors in this film the title should have been three days of density '' instead i kid my fellow reenactors unfortunately most people who have the money to spend on reenacting also have too much money to spend on good food and drink myself included so if you want to really learn about the battle read harry pfanz 's trilogy or stephen sears ' book if you want to see what civil war reenacting on a grand scale can be like this is a fine introduction
watching once and again '' is one of the most painful television shows to watch let along watch again this is not because it is a bad television show but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date i would like to be able to identify with rick but my personal situation is more like that of jake and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults i keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them watching once and again the complete second season '' on dvd the character i found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on abc was that of zoe manning there is a moment when she reads her parents lily and jake the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister grace but also ending up with less years where the family scribbling rivalry '' anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again if you have been spared that particular experience then i really do not know why you would want what these people go through if the first season of once and again '' is about lily manning and rick sammler falling in love then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and to a new level of acceptance there is actually more abut lily and her new job scribbling rivalry '' and rick working on a for miles drentell edifice wrecked '' than there is about them being with each other while lily and rick are happy for the most part everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again feast or famine '' the major irony is that the dyad i am most interested in is karen and jessie especially knowing what is going to happen to karen in the third season and what evan rachel wood has done since this show ended although i am equally impressed by julie whalen as a young actress as well so i tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing albeit for different reasons but with more of an appreciation of how jessie is her mother 's daughter which is not always a good thing best of enemies '' especially since jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating food for thought '' having miles drentel is a mixed blessing because while watching david clennon is always a pleasure when he becomes a wedge between rick and david it is like watching michael and elliot on thirtysomething '' all over again but it does inspire a true moment of vision for rick ozymandias 2.0 '' and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having miles around is to bring rick down to the point that all he can offer lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot this becomes important because it means rick and lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe let alone live but dramatically the whole bit of karen and her law firm trying to stop miles and rick from building their project is more interesting edifice wrecked '' especially when it seems rick might end up going to prison wo n't someone please help george bailey tonight '' when the psychiatrist that jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as rick and karen get at each other it seems so obvious this really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun the other end of the telescope '' but bails on tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby forgive us out trespasses '' judy comes up with the great idea of booklovers '' despite lily 's negativity but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out will gluck eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music i ca n't stand up for falling down '' but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue note why rick and karen wasted time letting eli apply to the university of illinois at is beyond me because i have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this december i have to tell you that unless eli is going on a basketball scholarship he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation so my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into eli 's parents or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation my only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that lily is really way too judgmental at least when she does not immediately accept rick 's proposal another painfully true moment for me she does not leave him hanging for long and i liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring the fact that season two ends with the wedding the second time around '' might seem like the end of the story but only if you make the mistake of thinking once and again '' was simply about lily getting remarried it really is about trying to make two families one which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final and incomplete season to come out on dvd
this was a blast from the past for my husband and we purchased this for our 6 and 7 year olds and they really like it it fits right where they are in school and they laugh while they are learning often when we are doing homework i 'll say that 's what they said on the electric company '' or remember what the electric company said this letters sound like '' and they do it 's been a joy to see something from my childhood work for them it 's great to play in the morning while they are getting ready for school plus i have to admit seeing morgan freeman and bill cosby in this is quite hilarious mistakes and all !
using the summit and negotiations over debt relief as the background for a romantic comedy seemed at least to me like a recipe for disaster but thanks to great writing and an amazing performance by bill nighy the girl in the cafe is an unexpected gem do n't miss it
this is a very enjoyable film about the music and spirit of one of our greatest rock musicians i love neil young 's music and i love this film
i went into this dvd with low expectations and wound up really enjoying it maybe enjoy '' is n't the right word it is intense it is political and i usually am on the opposite side of hollywood politics and it jumps around from subplot to subplot in fact i dozed off for 10 minutes and got entirely lost and had to rewind to fill in the blanks but i found it very plausible and that is what a good movie should give a plausible thesis and play it out it succeeds here it makes us think of the laws of unintended consequence sure it makes the gov't and big oil look inherently evil and characaturizes them but that usually makes for a good starting point since most large organizations usually succumb to fear greed anyway i once heard a history professor say it is n't about the struggle of good vs evil it is always about the struggle of good vs good sides always think they are right and god is on their side '' watch it you will come out the other side thinking
this was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all it was a very sad day when the election was stolen from gore but this movie gave me a new realization that being in office would have held this man back his talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious this is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes he gives a website for more ideas and info if you think this might be too boring for your taste give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish thank you gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen
i thought this movie was pretty good i 've seen a lot of nicholas cage movies the rock con air etc so maybe i am biased towards him i 've watched this movie 3 times and it does n't wear thin too quick like some movies
i enjoyed ice age and this movie is good as well thankfully all of the cast from the original ice age returned and the comedy as well and besides the characters the story is another original idea and a great stand alone movie by itself and thankfully not a rehasing of an old one the ice age is coming to an end and our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for higher ground before their valley gets flooded manny along the way begins to question his own mortality and the fact that he is the last mammoth '' or is he well that what everybody thinks until they run across a family of opossums do n't see how opossums and mammoths tie together just watch the movie queen latifah was a good addition to the cast great film one for the collection
star wars in any format will always be the greatest movie of all time
what a great story and an ending ! i was so excited about the conclusion of this 2 hr program that i coud n't sleep at all
wonderful terry gilliam is the orson welles of our time lambasted by critics for his excesses admired by others for his genius i 'm with the genius crowd brothers grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie i 've seen in a long while gilliam 's style is baroque and by a director who knows the definition visually this can be quite stunning as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene sort of like a durer woodcut as imagined by hieronymus bosch and the brothers grimm is perfect ground for gilliam 's magic a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas it 's 1812 the age of napoleon not a good time for the imagination nevertheless jake will grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear since it 's also an age of anxiety and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night the bumbling grimms are played quite effectively by matt damon who pulls off the accent nicely and heath ledger a head scratching success their evil counterparts end products from the age of reason are a french general played by jonathan pryce and his wacky henchman played by the always wonderful peter stormare little girls are disappearing in a small town and something needs to be done about it and the grimms are caught in the middle you will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales as the grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery to reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises check it out
monk '' is quite an interesting show it is about this character named adrian monk played by tony shalhoub wings '' who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias he is also incredibly intelligent he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly provided that he has all the right clues the most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words which for some of the most intense cases will really shock the audience i 've solved the case '' however for some reason the best part always seems to be when he says here 's what happened '' when it comes to the scenes involving murder cases it must be known that the antagonists of some episodes can get very very brutal they will do things like whack people against the head with crowbars slice up their bodies with chainsaws smash their hands with car doors and sometimes they will even try drowning them and like the antagonists of macgyver '' they are not afraid to use guns if necessary the acting is phenomenal especially by tony shalhoub and ted levine capt stottelmeyer the photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene in each episode finally this dvd is practically perfect in picture and sound quality it has extras like featurettes and you have the option of listening to it in three different languages english spanish and french i found it all interesting in conclusion this tv show has it all good background music great dialogue interesting stories good acting and interesting cinematography the kab score 8.9 super
i did not see john carpenter 's original version of assault on precinct 13 '' but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake i was paying attention so i knew what the set up was both inside and out of the precinct as we went along but being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in james demonaco 's script i made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters i was sure would survive all the bullets and i was which is a polite way of saying i was it is new year 's eve in richet 's film and it has started to snow heavily precinct 13 officially closes at the stroke of midnight and filling up the last boxes are sergeant jake roenick ethan hawke who has been hiding behind a desk ever since an undercover gig went horribly bad and he was wounded while his two partners were killed grizzled veteran jasper o'shea brian dennehy who is always talking about retirement and secretary iris ferry drea de matteo who is always talking about sex with bad boys jake would rather talk about sex than his feelings about what happened before with alex sabian mario bello the department shrink who happens to stop by on a snowy new year 's eve to take another crack at jake 's psyche then a detroit police transport bus shows up with a quartet of prisoners unable to get to the prison because of the storm and a highway accident there is beck john leguizamo who will not shut up anna alisha hinds a girl with a who proclaims her innocence smiley ja rule a counterfeiter and marion bishop laurence fishburne the most notorious criminal in the city who has just been arrested for murdering an undercover cop under suspicious circumstances so when a couple of guys with guns break into the precinct and everybody is yelling these are bishop 's men coming to get get we do not buy it after all as soon as bishop saw them he hid behind a wall things are just beginning to get interesting assault on precinct 13 '' is an action film where the human element is really more interesting once jake figures out that to survive the night he needs everybody to help out which means not only the prisoners but the women everybody gets a gun in this one but you know full well that not everybody can be trusted with one furthermore jake is fully aware that bishop is the smartest and deadliest person there but this movie is all about making the best of a bad situation that keeps getting worse the death of one character really puts the way this is going to play out into question and i liked the note on which the film actually ends once we finally get down to the inevitable confrontation between the two main characters not great but certainly an enjoyable action picture with a minimum amount of stupidity on the part of the characters once you accept the idea the die is cast and it is all or nothing for the bad guys that is a pretty good recommendation for this genre
maybe better than the original i liked that they focused on wonka 's childhood throughout the film that was something that really added to the storyline they really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal too i guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original was n't anywhere to be seen in this one but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it oh and the children seemed especially bratty this time which made it better when those bad things happened to them a friend pointed out to me that this version has a lot more musical numbers good call i do n't know if the ending was better than the original but it was certainly a very good interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake i do n't want to reveal what happens at the end so let 's just say that when the factory tour is over and charlie leaves there 's still a decent chunk of storyline left i was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of living in a world of chocolate '' element was n't really there which is definitely a bad thing i mean come on we all want a world of chocolate ! i just feel there should have been more things included in the film overall it 's probably not better than the original but it 's not worse either you really need to own both
having seen stella 's live show in hollywood i had a sneaking suspicion that i was going to love their comedy central show and i was not disappointed these guys have mastered the art of and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end i guess i 'm not surprised it did n't last this kind of humor is n't for everyone but come on we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include mind of mencia and blue collar comedy both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer these guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years and i hope to see them in another show or movie soon until then i 'll be enjoying stella on dvd
that is really what said when they took this the funniest show ever on off the air in less than six shows my friends in high school and i watchedcthis show every time it came on it was a parrody of all the cop shows from the 60 's and 70 's and was falling down funny later the group who gave us airplane would retool their baby into the naked gun '' movies and make a mint at the boxoffice each show could be watched many times just to catch the jokes you missed i 'm so happy that they have all six shows on dvd now and i can get rid of the old cut up copy that i had on vhs and remember smoke '' yes i know but what happened
this film is a gripping true life portrait of the path poverty takes when it poverty decides to destroy life and hurt those who can not defeat its ties of depression one of the strongest film ever seen ! ! ! a must see
i really loved this story ! each actor played his role perfectly and the filming and special effects were outstanding
the thing i like about this movie was that it was wholesome something the whole family could watch together without having to worry about bleeping the bad parts out ! cute entertaining story with some romance thrown in for interest
stagecoach '' is significant along with destry rides again '' for redefining the western for adult '' audiences director john ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences for sure the film does contain a number of western archetypes the gambler the prostitute with a heart of gold etc but they transcend the stereotypes stagecoach '' is also significant as the film that broke john wayne to mainstream audiences wayne 's entrance as the ringo kid is the stuff of legends there is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated claire trevor as the social pariah dallas and thomas mitchell as doc boone for which he won an oscar the film 's status as being historically significant is not debatable as first class entertainment it is timeless
i watched this movie and once it finished i decided i had to log on to amazon and buy it up this film is so well done from the characters the actors the dialogue and the stories a pure enjoyment to watch i hope everyuone sees it at least once
this film is visually stunning with a soundtrack that sounds truly haunted occasionally the film lets itself down with it 's editing i sometimes feel disorientated thinking wait slow down will you '' having said that this film is well acted and really puts you in the netherlands of the century it may not be as hard hitting and exciting as turkish delight but this film is equally competent and well worth watching
i love good underrated movies they make you feel like you 're part of a priviledge club of connoisseurs i 'm not a movie buff but deep cover has all the elements you would expect of a classic great acting memorable lines interesting and logical plot and a decent ending laurence fishburne is at his best in his role of an undercover cop slowly crossing the line between pretending to be a drug dealer and pretending to be a cop jeff golblum is one of those actors you either love or hate and i loved him playing the dirty lawyer laundering drug money there 's a great chemistry between the two and the supporting cast which to me was one of the main weakness of new jack city the use of laurence fishburne 's character as the narrator works wonder and somewhere between the slow dark wailings of the movie theme the nightime shots of downtown la and laurence fishburn 's poetic lines the movie grabs you into a world an urban jungle crowded with nightime vultures heartless killers and hopeless junkies deep cover is somewhere between fables and magical realism a place where reality exceeds fiction a great movie the dvd is so so almost no extras and the picture quality is good without being great
where do i start jack nicolson is a magnificant actor he can play anybody and his performance in this film was top notch i recomend anyone that claims to be a fan of his to check this film out i guarantee you will be satisfied
2002 the first film 2 2004 the second film introduction in 2002 the first of the hit theatres it 's not likely that the film 's director sam raimi had any idea just how successful his incarnation of the classic superhero would be it drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres and the dvd releases did the same the sequel appropriately enough was even more hyped and did even better and now both films have been combined into a single set ! read on for my review of the films storyline essentially this set includes both of the films the first of the two films explains how peter parker got bitten by a radioactive spider and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into in the first film the villain is former head of oscorp norman osborn who has been transformed into the green goblin by a chemical he was testing the second film continues two years after the first left off and features facing off against doc ock a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body this time around juggling the duties of being with work and school have made peter parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle opinions both of these films rule seeing the first film turned me into a fan practically overnight the acting and storyline are both excellent particuarly willem dafoe 's portrayal of norman green goblin everything the first film did well the second one does even better i was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them but sam raimi does it here these are great films and the fact that they 're together in one package only sweetens the deal dvd these are the standard dvd releases of the film meaning each one has a bonus disc of material there are a ton of bonus features including commentary cast and crew interviews and assorted other extras too the second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books and the plotlines of them ! that 's my favorite extra on either of the discs the other features are also excellent and if you like the films you 'll agree they 're worthwhile overall i ca n't begin to express my satisfaction with these films the cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece and i think you 'll agree superhero movies do n't get any better being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet these are movies regardless of who you are even if you 're not a big fan of the franchise you may be pleasantly surprised
i saw this movie for the first time when i was 5. i 'm still watching it at 65. they will never be another movie to surpass this one
the movie was terrific and the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars was because there was quite a bit of spanish in the film and the subtites from spanish to english did n't seem to work on my copy english subtitles appeared for engliish and spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke spanish ! strange fortunately i know some spanish so i could sort of pick it up but i do n't know why the sub titles did n't work anyway bogie was very good and the story was too three men set out to find gold and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey besides all that were the usual bandits and indians and so forth but it kept you watching and that 's what really counts wo n't tell you if they got any gold !
i thought this was a very good film well written filmed cast and acted very dark humor i myself would have used lawyers guns and money by warren zevon and knockin ' on heavens door bob dylan on the sound track
this movie is so touching i loved the determination of the girl it 's been a while since i 've seen this movie so forgive me for not remembering the characters ' names my children got hooked on foreign films after watching this movie with me a great family movie or just a clean chick flick
i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it i love it ! ! ! ! this dvd is fantastic ! ! ! ! ! !

what can one add to what 's already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time citizen kane '' has been analyzed more than any other movie in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as kane '' itself it 's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary the battle over citizen kane '' and the hbo film rko 281 '' i 'm amazed at how many people i encounter who have watched citizen kane '' once and thought it was just but seeing it once is simply not enough this is true of any great film but more so for kane '' a multifaceted work that can not be fully digested upon first viewing in many ways kane '' is the bible of modern cinema you 'll find something new each time you watch it orson welles ' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique narrative innovation and ensemble acting the story of charles foster kane a newspaper tycoon based more or less on william randolph hearst unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks welles and cinematographer gregg toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing welles as kane ages 50 years over the course of the film aided by makeup artist maurice seiderman 's wizardry welles ' mercury players including joseph cotten agnes moorehead ruth warrick ray collins everett sloane and erskine sanford round out an impressive cast the expertly produced documentary the battle over citizen kane '' recounts the factors that nearly prevented welles ' film from seeing the light of day but it belabors the comparison between welles and hearst both were certainly ambitious men and charles foster kane is based as much on welles as on hearst but the similarities end shortly thereafter by repeating the popular wisdom that welles ' career tanked after kane '' the documentary glosses over welles ' achievements welles went on to make several great films two of which touch of evil '' and chimes at midnight '' are often cited by welles scholars as superior to kane '' while the documentary overdoes the comparisons between welles and hearst rko 281 '' distorts the relationship between welles liev schrieber and kane '' herman mankiewicz john malkovich mankiewicz was holed up with welles ' mercury theatre partner john houseman not welles at victorville and houseman was welles ' confidant throughout the kane '' controversy not mankiewicz if the film simplifies relationships it remains an enjoyable if somewhat lightweight of the controversy with great performances by james cromwell as the imperious hearst and melanie griffith as the ditsy marion davies back to the inevitable question is citizen kane '' the greatest movie of all time quite possibly though touch of evil '' might be even better among welles ' own films but kane '' is more inexhaustible and more conducive to repeated viewing and study citizen kane '' has topped the highly regarded sight and sound '' polls since 1962 and the american film institute reinforced kane 's '' 1 status with its 1998 top 100 list can all the critics experts and film buffs all be wrong watch citizen kane '' not once but twice or more and decide for yourself

this dvd set was outstanding the and seasons of seinfeld were at the height of the show great extras !
the legend of zelda complete animated series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children 's cartoon should be right there with teenage mutant ninja turtles '' street sharks '' and recess '' the legend of zelda was and still is such an exceptional video game series for all ages and the tv show followed in its footsteps it combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy and some jokes that still today make me laugh lookin ' good princess ! 'specially from this angle ! '' as children we see link yell that to zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences but later that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee and wonder how we ever missed it before but the series is most enjoyable for those of us who faithfully stuck to the actual video game series the implimentation of original sound effects into the cartoon is an added bonus that draws us back for more and waiting to see which classic zelda enemy will cause link and zelda trouble next is just that much more fun especially if you can name them but by far the most fun thing about this show is waiting and praying for the day when link can coax a kiss out of the lovely princess and they 've come so close it almost made me angry when they got interrupted link tries so hard and makes such an idiot out of himself trying that you 'd think he deserves a little action once in a while but every time no matter how he tries he either messes up or is interrupted by ganon 's attempts to steal the triforce all in all if you grew up with te super mario super show and you 're a nintendo fan you 'll appreciate this show as much as you love to watch it
this is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor i really enjoyed watching it i think it has great replay value as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness i found it more reminiscent of the old 60 's films like 'monte carlo or bust ' or 'those magnificent men ' jackie chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the foil to 'fillius fogg ' played with brilliant english reserve humor by 'steve coogan ' there 's no comparison to the original the film does n't even try to copy rather it takes a silly story with silly character 's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family movies you 'll see because this is n't a typical 'martial arts ' vehicle for 'jackie chan ' i found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline check out for instance the in the which goes to show why 'jackie chan ' is probably the best star in the world right now there 's much that 's in his performance all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts the are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices most notably 'it 's a mad mad mad mad world ' what i think is the best comedy ever this is by no means a comparison anyway 'arnold swarzenneger ' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a turkish prince no less possibly the poorest arabian impression ever which is of course why it works so well and 'rob schneider ' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice miss 'cecile de france ' is a beautiful comedy foil manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent i hope to see more from her you might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but i found a lot of it to be nicely restrained this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set check out the extras all in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing
the main character lebowski is a bum of a person living in los angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by john goodman and steve buscemi suddenly lebowski 's life is changed when he is mistaken for another lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters the plot evolves as many other coen movies raising arizona comes to mind as we are introduced to colorful characters and the plot gets outrageous yet somehow still seems real my favorite component of this film is the character played by john goodman a polish veteran who converted to judaism after marrying his he has a plan to help lebowski extricate himself from the mess and he does n't bowl on shabbos he also his 's pomeranian when she goes out of town if you liked raising arizona you 'll want to watch this movie over and over again
the dude that or uh his dudeness or uh duder or el duderino if you 're not into the whole brevity thing '' those are the dude 's immortal words he used to introduce himself to the other jeffery lebowski you 're probably thinking what is he talking about who is the other jeffery lebowski well i 'll tell you in just a moment i 've just got some things to clear up first joel and ethan coen have made some of the most loved films of all time and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making of all time these fellows bought you the cult favourite blood simple the hillarious raising arizona the decietful millers crossing the crazy barton fink the hudsuckers proxy and the blood drenched fargo and now this one of the finest films they 've done the big lebowski jeff bridges is jeffery lebowski or in this case the dude john goodman plays the vietnam veteran walter steve buscemi is not in it too often but he plays the loveable donnie let 's just go through the character sketches only the dude 's bowling pals characters the big lebowski 's main character is the dude he lives in la he listens to creedance clearwater revival his favourite drink is a white russian and he loves bowling the film is set in as we 've established before los angeles the dude is an average joe slacker who dresses in as what you could say 'the hippie who likes to surf clothing ' sandals shorts crummy old shirts jersey jackets jackets that are jerseys he never wears socks with his shoes even in bowling shoes and occasionly glasses let 's also not forget his long hair that makes the dude 's image so legandary the dude 's bowling buddies are walter sobchak and donny walter is a vitnam veteran and refers everything to nam ' he mostly wears shorts a shirt with a sleeveless jacket hiking shoes socks obviously and always and i mean always wears his aviator sun glasses he also has sort of an army man buzz cut with a beard around his mouth donny is a great bowler whenever we see him bowl he gets a strike except for once later on do n't want to spoil anything that 's all we bassicly know about him except that he usually when bowling wears long pants a bowling shirt tucked in and a haircut where is hair is n't too long or too short he 's a nice guy and is usually told to shut up by walter because of his late involvement in conversations with the dude and walter the plot the movie kicks off with a man narrating he has a texan accent and talks about a man named jeffery lebowski who also goes by the name 'the dude ' and is the supposed storyteller of the dude 's story but does n't narrate until later on as he narrates we see the dude in a grocery store in his sandals and the previous statements i made of the clothes he wears he 's looking at milk and tests one of them to see if it 's sour he later arrives home with his purchased milk but is surprised by two thugs they dunk his head in the toilet and are telling him to give them the money that bunny owes them they later realise that it 's not the jeffery lebowski they 're after they 've soiled the dude 's rug and they eventually leave but the dude wants to get to the man who they were supposed to get this is the other jeffery lebowski i was talking about and is the millionaire lebowski he 's bassicly the title 's name the big lebowski '' the dude pitches up at the millionaire 's mansion and attempts to get a free carpet in exchange for what the thugs were supposed to do to the big lebowski 's carpet he eventually get 's what he wants but is then later called by jeffery lebowski to drop off money to kidnappers who kidnapped his trophy wife bunny to cut this short the film is about the dude trying to get bunny back to jeffery lebowski and how he has to deal with other problems that jeffery lebowski has because people come looking after him because of the same name he shares with the millionaire lebowski the drop off of the kidnapping leads to all of his other problems walter is told about the ransom money by the dude and decides that the dude and himself should keep the money instead because walter thinks that bunny kidnapped herself walter gives the kidnappers a bag full of dirty laundry that he had so they keep the money in the car when they go bowling as they come out his car is gone so they have to get the money back without jeffery lebowski knowing the film is hilarious but that does n't mean that it 's just a normal movie it 's stunnig the dialogue is sharp and witty although there 's alot of swearing that does n't mean the humour is just fowl mouthed it 's hillarious some of the lines go down in history as some of the funniest one liners ever the coen 's writing here is as good as ever with excelently written and thought out characters jeff bridges and john goodman are absolutely hilarious they 're definately the funniest characters in this movie jesus is also funny and make you wish the film would never end the other things that are worth watching the film for are the acid trip sequences and the absolutely incredible vintage rock soundtrack this is a comedy lover 's dream come true if you love the coens and excellent snappy humour then this is a must have for you even you do n't know the coens too well or even comedy then here 's a film too start with just buy this now or soon or whenever you have a split second of a chance to buy it i ca n't tell you what the special features are on this disc because i have the region 2 edition this one most probably has the same trailer my one has so if it 's the same as the region 2 features then it 's got absolutely no good special features worth writing about
i was a teenager in the 80 's so i love all of the old 80 's teen movies but some kind of wonderful makes my top three the performances were believable the actors became the characters not the other way around eric stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks literally who wants to pursue art instead of business mary stuart masterson is his best friend a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him lea thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty and her boyfriend craig scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend and the only off note keith eric stoltz is interested in amanda lea thompson and takes the opportunity to ask her out when she breaks up with her boyfriend to spite the boyfriend she says yes watts mary stuart masterson predicts trouble and their friendship is tested my favorite line from the movie is when keith defends amanda claiming you ca n't judge a book by its cover '' watts cynically replies yeah but you can tell how much it 's gon na cost '' finally watts agrees to help keith prepare for the date including helping him practice kissing '' and it 's a doozy of a kiss throw in john ashton as keith 's father maddie corman as his meddlesome sister and elias koteas as the scary guy keith befriends in detention and you have a wonderful '' movie
based on historical events which are still poorly undertsood this movie depicts werner heisenberg and niels bohr the titans of quantum mechanics in its halcyon days during the and caught in an encounter which is a loose human analogy to heisenberg 's famous uncertainty principle which demonstrates mathematically that you can not know both the exact speed and position of a single electron drawing from the tony play by michael frayn who also wrote noises off the movie revolves around the dialogue between these two men sometimes together with bohr 's wife who meet in copenhagen in 1942 when heisenberg the german who has been placed within the scientific research progam of the nazis in their quest to build a nuclear bomb visits his mentor and colleague bohr the dane who is living through nazi occupation of his native land there are deep unresolved questions about the motives of heisenberg which the characters try to resolve in a series of talks and walks through the same park where the two physicists previoulsy stolled to debate the ideas which came to form the foundation of quantum physics set against a piano score which resonates with the inner sense of uncertainty and suspicion in the dialogue the movie achieves some the things that the big stage does not allow including flashbacks and scenes ranging back and forth between the park and bohr 's home note i enjoyed the movie as much as the play in an era where cinematic palates seem titillated mostly by fast action thrillers this movie is another example of how well constructed dialogue makes for gripping cinematic drama when it goes hand in hand with superb casting and performance
i enjoyed the first season and got it eagerly awaiting season 2. see it for sale overseas in the uk but not here tough waiting so long sigh i can do other formats besides north america but it 's a pain c'mon guys i 'd rather spend the money here
the grapes of wrath is a great movie perhaps one of the best i have ever seen however having read the book i notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out by taking out these crucial yet quiet scenes the movie has a faster pace than the book in the movie grandpa died suddenly the only explanation for his death was that he had a stroke in the book the preacher casy explained to the family members that the old man could not leave his land his home and his way of life casy explained that grandpa was spiritually dead when he left his house and it did not take long for his body to also die this shows the great sacrifice that the joads must make in order to survive in the movie it just seems that they pack up leave and arrive without any moral dilemmas grandpa dies in another family 's tent not just on a blanket by the road this is important because in the book it symbolizes the way people have to help one another in times of need in the scenes in california the pace slows down a bit so i can feel the details of the book surface in the movie with the events leading up to casy 's death crisp and clear i could understand his death as brutal murder and tom 's speech about him carrying on casy 's work beautifully taken from the book i really loved these scenes because unlike most of the movie these scenes do remain true to the book and because of that they are full of detail and you can see the hand of steinbeck at work despite all of these forgotten scenes the grapes of wrath is one of the best movies of all time
why does title always seem to be ommitted from any bond collection release connery in a remake of thunderball is this not a relesae by the same production company it is a mgm release so why does n't it ever get included any light that can be shed would be greatly
there simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than frank gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work he has both his passionate lovers and haters i am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle i really love some of his work while i find some of his work to be quite off putting the person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of gehry 's work art critic claude jencks the person who popularized the term postmodern '' jencks for whose deceased wife gehry designed a memorial building states bluntly that gehry has made some ugly buildings i think with gehry more than most architects one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition whatever else one may say about gehry he is n't like other architects one reviewer below called this a puff piece '' but that is n't really correct it is more correct to call it a conversation with a friend gehry asked his close friend the mainstream director sydney pollack to make a documentary of his work the result is a fine portrait of gehry 's career pollack certainly does not criticize his work but interestingly he does not over praise it either they do call attention to the fact that many simply do n't like his work and the film contains numerous excerpts from one of gehry 's more vociferous and respected critics hal foster but the point of the film is not to provide an objective and critical overview of frank gehry 's work the point is to get to know frank gehry and some of his ideas about architecture in this the film succeeds marvelously if one watches a number of documentaries about architects one thing that is striking is how many of them are enormously likable individuals for every irascible frank lloyd wright there are ten you 'd love to sit down and have a beer with much like pei frank gehry comes across as an immensely likable guy in this film perhaps away from his friend 's camera he is an implacable tyrant but those qualities if they exist are not apparent here instead he comes across as a genuinely nice guy in fact a couple of the individuals interviewed stress that as laid back as gehry is he really does have an ego i do n't think i 've ever heard a person in the creative field have anyone insist that appearance aside they really do have an ego in the vast majority of cases that is all too apparent i found it interesting to see the shots of gehry and either of his design partners working with him on designs if you are accustomed to think of architecture as akin to drafting watching gehry work is a bit of a shock he does n't design so much as sculpt he and his partners look like a couple of extremely mature kindergartners with scissors and paper as they cut bend shape snip and play with variations on the model they are struggling with there is apparently little or no concern with the particular materials to be used he seems rather to struggle with the kind of overall shape with the assumption that with today 's materials any kind of design can be turned into a reality the film really brings out how gehry 's own conception of architecture is much closer to sculpture than to engineering as a resident of chicago a city noted for his importance to twentieth century architecture it has been amazing to realize how little of his work has been done here in fact apart from his controversial what else work in millennium park i 'm not aware of anything else he has done here as a result i have less direct experience with gehry 's work than many other leading architects i must confess that much of what i see appears to be fascinating i would for instance absolutely love to see his bilbao museum but there is one aspect to gehry 's work that i really applaud its emphasis on individualism one criticism of much architecture has been its essential conservativism much of it espouses nonegalitarian and conformist values one sees exceptions such as louis sullivan 's refusal to put box seats in his chicago auditorium design if one looks at a gehry design it is hard to imagine it ever becoming the style of choice of a repressionistic totalitarian regime it is too individualistic too anarchic for that even such a free spirit as louis kahn still designed the capitol of bangladesh but it is simply impossible to imagine frank gehry designing a capitol i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i came away from it with a greater liking for frank gehry as a person than i had anticipated and perhaps i will in the future be more inclined to appreciate his designs he may not be the greatest of our architects but he certainly is one of our more likable free spirits
we love these movies ! they entertain the child as well as the adult ! we went through a period where we watched these every night before bed ! much better than the baby einstein collection ! we 've made this our designated baby shower gift ! everyone should have a copy ! they are good for parents as a stress relief you do n't even need to watch them just have them playing in the background the music is absolutely wonderful i love when i catch my kids humming the music as they are playing perfect for any age boy or girl ! thank you hbo
i loved the movie it has a lot of hidden symbols like almodovar is accustomed to doing however the music was the best
warner has been doing a magnificent job of using the latest picture resolution process to restore polish up their best movies and again they do not disappoint ! warner home video truly hits a home run and does the incredible with this boxed set of five of the greatest musicals of all time ! the set is well presented with excellent digital transfer wonderful sound and a bevy of sublime extras the band wagon which itself is a two dvd special edition stars fred astaire as an older entertainer trying to be successful again in show business things do not go well he does n't like the director there are n't fancy dance scenes that he prefers to perform and he has to dance with a ballerina ! the show is unpopular and fred 's character tony hunter saves the day using his superior technique and the extras are wonderful ! liza minnelli whose dad vincente minnelli did an excellent job as director of the picture and michael feinstein provide an engaging commentary there are also two documentaries get aboard ! the band wagon '' about the making of the movie and an older expose entitled the men who made the movies vincente minnelli '' you wo n't regret are excellent and very informative ! smile there 's also the outtake musical number of two faced women very good ! for astaire fans there 's an astaire trailer collection and even a musical short of jack buchanan with the glee quartet i was particularly pleased with the fine commentary liza minnelli and michael feinstein give here the other two disc special edition is of the mgm classic easter parade wow ! this has always been one of my very favorite musicals the acting and the chemistry between astaire playing the professional dancer and judy garland playing hannah brown his at first unlikely dance eventually romantic nothing short of excellent and captivating ! ann miller turns in a great performance as the dancer who leaves fred 's character to try to get even further ahead in her career the digital quality of the video and the sound are both excellent there 's a documentary of the making of this movie and a particular favorite of mine is the american masters documentary profile judy garland by myself '' put out only with the essential effort of my friend john fricke the american masters documentary won more than just one emmy making this a particularly valuable extra ! john won one of the emmys for this he is the leading garland biographer who wrote several books on judy john worked so hard on this profile ! john 's fine commentary along with ava astaire fred astaire 's daughter proves to be an excellent resource for reliable information about this film and judy you also get the outtake musical number mr monotony '' there 's a judy garland trailer collection and some promotions for the original film are provided wow ! a fine two disc set in and of itself bells are ringing is judy holliday 's last performance she plays a worker at a telephone answering service who gets overly involved with her client 's personal lives jean stapleton a favorite actress of mine from all in the family as edith is in this picture as well this picture was nominated for an oscar for best scoring of a musical picture and the song just in time '' is certainly one good reason why ! outtake musical numbers include is it a crime '' and my guiding star '' the digital transfer is again excellent and the sound quality is excellent this is definitely a classic musical brigadoon boasts a wonderful musical score by lerner and lowe the principle cast is only the best gene kelly van johnson and cyd charisse an adventurous american suddenly uncovers a magical scottish town which is only visible one day a century ! does he stay there and perhaps experience a fine true love or should he return to his life as it is quite the dilemma ! there are three musical outtakes you want to look at come to me bend to me '' from this day on '' and sword dance '' an audio outtake and a brand new digital transfer make this a fine addition to the box set as well as your dvd collection last but certainly not least is finian 's rainbow a wonderful fanciful musical this film stars fred astaire in his final full length performance as finian mclonergan somehow finian steals a pot of gold from og the leprechaun finian and his daughter sharon the lovely petula clark go to america as does og and use their powers to overcome a rather prejudiced senator not only are the musical numbers excellent the cinematography is superlative and the ending is a happy one ! there is an excellent commentary by director francis ford coppola and a cute feature on the film 's premiere all in all this is clearly one of the best boxed sets of supremely fine great musicals and it is very reasonably priced for me personally this set was an easy is already in my personal dvd collection ! i highly recommend this boxed set for fans of the great american musicals as well as all patrons of the arts this is also a solid introduction to some of the quality musicals produced on film to date equally important the hard work and effort everyone put into the seemingly countless extras is superlative
the great dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director charlie chaplin the movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of world war 2 and at the rise of the nazi party the similarities between dictator adolf hitler and the comedic genius that is charlie chaplin is quite interesting both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year same month in the same week chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing hitler for this film he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film the great dictator has the ability to tug at your heart and make you laugh until you cry the music is gorgeous and the writing is superb though some scenes do drag a bit most of it flows smoothly perhaps the most famous scene in the movie is the final speech given by chaplin it is just him staring at the camera and nothing stops him from saying what he feels movie buffs have to see this film the great dictator is a beautiful presentation that showcases the cinema genius of charlie chaplin
every film in this collection is a gem annie hall and manhattan are both top notch followed by bananas everything you wanted to know about sex sleeper heck even interiors was such a radical departure its worth seeing at least once or twice but to me the real diamonds in the rough of this set are stardust memories and love and death these two films are probably woody 's least talked about but really i think they are both fantastic films love and death is full of the witty one liners and pratfalls that were prevelant in his earlier funnier '' works but you can see in the dialogue of love and death that woody was maturing and stardust memories my favorite woody film this film says so much for anyone who fancies themselves an artist '' who is trying to figure out what they want to say and how to say it maybe my one beef is the lack of extras on these dvd 's but for the money you ca n't beat the price of this set
these movies are beautiful and intense one of those you must watch and enjo
if you 're looking for a silly movie with no content this is not a collection for you the series is a great insight to a range of human emotions and finding your true self i recommend it to anybody who loves good movies just beware this set has english subtitles so if you do n't like that you can think twice before commiting to a purchase
i like it a whole lot but pretty good ! i liked the older elmo movies better than this one
the answer is no deal ! in ruthless people danny devito is great as sam and bette midler as barbara is terrific but together they are a miserable couple sam who has a girlfriend carol wants out of the marriage but does n't want it to cost him anything when he learns that barbara has been kidnapped he thinks he has it made ! by not agreeing to pay the ransom amount no matter how little that might be he counts on the kidnappers to save him from paying alimony by bumping barbara off ! the bumbling kidnappers are ken and sandy adeptly played by judge reinhold and helen slater they have a grudge against sam who stole their dress design and made a mint they are astounded when after giving sam their demands he emphatically says 'no deal ' and hangs up on them in desperation they lower the amount sam still says 'no deal ' ! barbara learns sam has refused to pay the ransom not once but twice ! she is furious and ca n't believe that she has been marked down like clothes on a sale rack ! barbara and sandy create a bond when barbara through a better diet and exercise has lost weight and needs different size clothes and sandy provides her with clothing she has designed barbara loves the designs and they decide to form a partnership their first agenda being sam and the second developing a clothing line the plot thickens when the police become involved thanks to carol as suspicion focuses on sam he is forced to come up with the ransom to clear himself ! fuming he gets the money and drops it off counting on the police to arrest the kidnappers and retrieve his money the drop off does not go well a car chase ensues ! and then what happens next is hmmm let 's just say sam 's fortune takes a dive
i 'm not one to go in length about films on amazon but i 'll write a short little bit for this amazing film i first saw this 10 years ago when i was in my teens and have never forgotten it it really touched something inside of me much like a great piece of art would affect you after seeing it up close for the first time
hal hartley never fails to entertain never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level simple men is no exception the seemingly simple plot two brothers in search of their missing dad provides so much room for character growth that i wish there were an entire series of films centered around them with a view of the world as there 's no such thing as adventure there 's no such thing as romance there 's only trouble and desire '' actually from a fritz lang movie of the 1920 's there 's plenty going on to both prove and disprove hartley 's ambivalent theories simple men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious elena lwensohn in one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50 's dance to sonic youth 's kool thing '' then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number many dismiss this film and hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point what is amazing about hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that once seen reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane simple men is pure cinematic delight hooray for hartley
not being familiar with yoga i chose this dvd because of rodney yee 's reputation and the low cost what i found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed and yet energized after the first session there are no bells or whistles just a great workout i 've purchases two other titles in the series power yoga strength and power yoga stamina and i switch off each workout some of the moves are more difficult than others but it gives you something to work up to if i could n't do a stretch i would go as far as i could and hold it it was a great feeling when i was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly i was unable to do aside from these video 's the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain i do know this for a fact

when daryl deever william hurt tells tv reporter tony sokolow sigourney weaver he knows more than he actually does about a murder in the building where he works as a janitor he gets more than he bargained for deever is a good guy smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms he 's sort of engaged to his best friend 's sister but he 's had a crush on sokolow for two years when the man in the building gets his throat slit sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her so he tells her he may know something she goes after the story and he goes after her sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated capable man known as joseph christopher plummer who is good friends with sokolow 's parents it becomes clear that her wealthy parents their rich friends and joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for jews to escape from the soviet union and to journey to israel and it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement too before long the man 's associates learn of deever 's gambit with sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing more lethally the real murderer learns of what deever said to sokolow and believes deever might actually know something he goes after deever this is a tight well constructed murder mystery with two components first is the romance which builds between the characters played by hurt and weaver these two people are attractive and smart hurt in particular comes across as guileless but he 's no one 's patsy the two are very likable second the situation which develops poses some ethical questions grades of gray come into play it would n't be accurate to say that the murderer is simply another bad guy the movie also features some actors besides hurt and weaver there 's christopher plummer who as usual brings so much assurance and nuance to his role james woods as the best friend always a little off balance pamela reed as woods ' sister her mutual declaration of with hurt is very funny and appealing steven hill and morgan freeman as the two cops assigned to the case kenneth mcmillan as hurt 's father angry and vulnerable and irene worth and albert paulsen as weaver 's parents people who love her but especially the mother always put responsibilities and obligations into the love they all are very good i like this movie a lot the dvd picture looks fine there are no extras to speak of
most people have a hard time adjusting to foreign films because reading subtitles and trying to watch the film is difficult that 's why i love melville 's le samourai not much speaking throughout the film equals minimal subtitles this film does n't require many lines of speech the main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect while trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him my first melville film and i loved it if you like this one you should also see le cercle rouge and especially bob le flambeur
there is n't one wasted second in this film not one ! ! ! you 'll be sucked in and surprised within the first two minutes and there 's very little dialogue so you need not worry about too much subtitle reading you can tell there 's a lot of influence from american film noir in this film but le samourai '' takes it to a level of perfection i wish some of the folks that throw their good money towards bad modern action flicks would take the time to watch le samourai '' they just might discover a thing or two about how it could really be done brilliant
spoilers when star trek 's production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold the cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode the result one of the most important and brilliant treks ever done ! everyone knows the basic plot by now spock kidnaps his crippled former captain and hijacks the enterprise and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all the federation he eventually is en route and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the enterprise 's visit to talos iv 13 years prior this is the episode which cements spock 's character forever the supposedly emotionless vulcan who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans leonard nimoy 's performance is one of his best as spock initially seeming as though spock had gone crazy almost kidnapping pike using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under 'secret orders ' all sorts of indications something must be wrong with spock until after the talosian 's plan is revealed where it is found they have been manipulating events all along and spock returns to his stoic self leaving the briefing room with pike for the last time his head bowed shoulders slumped shatner 's understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles i say 'unfair ' frankly it is perfect for the events all during these events kirk acts rather stunned at all these events his friend and officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship he almost dies going after him in a shutle then he is releived of command for all of this ! by the time the talosians supposedly abandon spock and forces the trial board to take a vote even kirk is convinced spock should be put the able to smile when the talosian shows him the 'rejuvenated ' pike happy again at last all of these performances are directed with care by marc daniels the veteran tv director who was at the helm of the 'envelope ' they make an deliberate point of cutting to the more mature unemotional spock during the famous 'laughing ' scene and you can almost see a flicker of 'was i that emotional ' cross his face ! the makeup used on sean kenney the 'substitute ' captain pike jeffery hunter was unavailable might be some of the best ever done for any trek it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage you are totally convinced this is an older horribly maimed jeffrey hunter ! some small parts of the cage are cut some shots of pike 's fellow ' some very sexist lines about 'women on the bridge ' and the obligatory 'aliens running through the computer ' scene none of these are very important to the plot of either the pilot or the envelope and just to add some trivia part ii of the menagerie was the highest rated episode of star trek ever in prime time ! actor malachi throne had been the original voice of the talosian keeper in the pilot since he was cast as commodore mendez voice artist vic perrin was dubbed in as the keeper as per the director 's guild marc daniels was credited as director for part i while the director of the cage robert mr pilot butler was given the screen credit for part ii the menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish !

i do n't know what it is about him and this dvd but my daughter 16 months is in love all you have to do is say his name and she runs to the tv pointing and stomping in excitement it 's just too funny she does n't get that way for anyone else
all monty python movies are a i think my generation has seen them all i hope the younger generation less than 40 watch at least one the humor is at many levels so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in this just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing like all good humor it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general as well as politics and religion without getting nasty
everybody knows the plot of this movie so i ca n't add anything in that respect however i can tell you that the quality of the dvd is very good clear picture and sound great buy

in the movie some like it hot its a great movie and its genre is comic and takes place in chicago and in movie is about two musicians that accidentallywitness a gangland shooting and then they the other people wanted to killed them morover they two musicians joe tony curtis and jerry jack lemmon decide to go to florida to participate to a girl jazz band the problem is that they can not go as boys so they decide to dress themselves as girls and to present themselves as josephine and daphne in they way to forida they meet a lverlorn singer that is marilyn plan is perfect until josephine falls in love with marilyn monroe then at the same time a old man falls in love with daphne and wants to engage her one conflict that the movie has is when the old man tries to engage daphne but she told hin that they ca n't marrie and she gievs a lot of excuses to him and he says that it does n't matter that he would forgive her in addition at the end she says to him that she is a man and he asnwers him that is ok that nobody is perfect i think that was a good conflict because eventhough she try to get away with it he accepts her without having a usual is that he would n't accept her bor being a man but that didnt matter to him the character in this movie are really good actors all of them had a great only thing that was different is that the gangster got killed and i think they didnt have a good acting all the sets wre good except for the one that i just talk about the lightning in the movie was very creative it was very good the costumes wre really nice and everyone dressed great in the movie the music the movie has was ok too because it goes with the type of the movie i had never seem a movie like this and i think it may relationate with the real life where people does this kind of things i recomend this film to all the people that want to have some fun and entertain themselves with something good like this movie
what a truly stunning film this type of film has been long overdue in the movie industry more of these should see the light
this film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters however its true appeal comes from the manner in which it portrays the desperation that comes from living a life which is less than truthful the struggles involved in being true to oneself despite the consequences and the difficulties that sometime occur when trying to figure out what is really important to your soul although i have recommended this film to several people i caution them that it can be pretty disturbing i thought about it for weeks after i saw it the first time and it took me a while to get up the nerve to watch it again definitely not a light hearted '' evening of entertainment
i own many of the 50 packs of movies and i must say i like this set very of these movies are from the 30 's and 40 's the hayday of movie mysterys the transfers are ok but not great and some of the movie have sterotype 's of all kinds just keep in mind when they were made and if they bother you do n't watch a nice set and a great way to build your movie collectio
introduction 3 games to glory iii is a video compilation of the 2004 new england patriots playoffs including their super bowl victory over the philadelphia eagles in super bowl xxxix this super bowl victory was the patriots third in four years marking them as the team of for new england patriots fans it 's a chance to relive the glory of super bowl victories and three championships in four years england patriots fans probably would not particularly enjoy this video main features 3 games to glory iii provides extensive highlights of both new england patriots ' playoff wins and super bowl victory after the 2004 season these playoffs found new england once again schooling the indianapolis colts in yet another year where peyton manning and the vaunted colts offensive choke under playoff pressure the high flying colts offense was throttled by the superior schemes and tough play of the patriots in a afc divisional playoff win at gillette stadium in foxborough massachusetts this is followed by new england 's dramatic defeat of the pittsburgh steelers in the afc championship game at heinz field in pittsburgh the patriots entered this game as decided underdogs to the steelers after being throttled by pittsburgh earlier in the season finally you get to enjoy the extensive highlights of new england 's impressive win over the nfc champion philadelphia eagles this is yet another game where new england 's superior execution and stamina in the later stages of the game brought them ultimate glory the super bowl was played in jacksonville florida on february 6 2005. the highlights of each game are very extensive and seem to cover nearly every play they are also mostly well done but frankly the highlights often fail to capture the real drama of the game of course no highlight reel can match the excitement and drama of a live contest but there are times when key turning points of the game really just become another quick hit in the video there are a few disappointments in this video though and it 's not quite as well done as the preceding 3 games to glory ii covering the patriots playoff run and super bowl victory after the 2003 season first there is not as much drama and preparation presented in these videos compared to last year secondly there are not as many close up on the field shots that bring the game right into your living room it 's much more distant and not as close up as previous editions in this series despite these drawbacks it 's still great to relive a great season through these videos bonus features the bonus features on this edition of 3 games to glory are not nearly as good as the ones on 3 games to glory ii the bonus features are nice they just did n't live up the standard in the previous edition following is a brief rundown of what you 'll get on the dvd there are some bill belichick '' breakdowns of key plays for each game but there are very few of them and really leaves the viewer wanting more there 's also a points after sounds of the game '' which shows bowl press conference features but again it 's really short and leaves you wanting more the patriot 's all access '' which appears along with each of the playoff and super bowl wins shows locker room scenes and practices team meetings and other shots of players as they prepare for games these are pretty well done short features that add a great deal to the video the all access '' section for the super bowl of course included plane trip post game party and the parade i find these a bit boring frankly but i guess it 's nice to see the players up close on their daily routines the super bowl highlights are shown twice once with the regular commentary and once with commentary from rosevelt colvin lb ted johnson lb and matt light t matt light is a funny guy and this was more entertaining than the one last year i thought the best bonus feature was one on disc two called views from the past '' with interviews with three great players from previous decades gino cappelletti of the 1960 's michael haynes of the 1970 's and andre tippett of the 1980 's and 1990 's this conversation was mostly about comparing this current patriots ' team with teams of the past and how the game has changed over the decades finally the video has the 2005 playoff roster super bowl stats and 2005 game by game results just like you can get in any book it just shows it printed on the screen overall while all these bonus features are nice 3 games to glory iii is not nearly as good as 3 games to glory ii it did not include an extensive behind the scenes segment on the super bowl which i found fascinating on the previous edition nor did it have highlights for each game of the regular season like the previous edition i found the lack of these too items very disappointing as i thought they were outstanding editions to last year 's disc nevertheless the bonus features overall are nice just nice as nice as last time bottom line all new england fans should enjoy reliving a third super bowl win through this highlights package it 's mostly well done and certainly brings back great memories of a great season those who are not patriots fans i am sure would find the video quite boring disclaimer i am a die hard new england patriots fan and am totally biased in this review
least its in my top 5 'm not the biggest chaplin of a keaton and dang if this movie dose n't do me in never fail to fall into hysterics over the feeding chair '' the gibberish several other i always get teary eyed over the plight of charlie and his little love movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next ! do n't be botherd by the hype about this being a social a commie film or whatever ! still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order ! ! i have this wonderful new 2 disc version from the chaplin collection box to pull out every christmas holiday with city i 'm want to check out the little cuban documentary on the second disc about the traveling projectionists who take the movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first tears in these peoples eyes as they you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film
it have a plenty range of glould 's legacy personally i hate the contemporary music honestly i bought it because it have one interpretation of the magestic partita in e minor it have a rear romatic influence and definitly it do n't have the same perfection with the greatest baroque influence that glenn leave us in the one recorded in 1957. nonetheless you will see the great personality of glenn and its lively interpretation
if you can get through david 's boot camp video with moderate effort this video may be a bit too easy for you that said this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser david does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form he is very encouraging throughout the workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used two dumbbells needed there are a few innovative moves thrown in as well since the difficulty level of any workout video is relative i 'll give a quick background of myself i run times a week for a total of i also lift weights times a week incorporating plyometrics and compound movements i 've personally found david 's boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using dumbbells and think this video is great for days i have less energy regardless of fitness level you are sure to enjoy this workout if you need to make it more intense use heavier weights the biggest thing to remember about david 's style in my opinion is to really on every repetition on the muscle being worked and on isometrics contracting the muscle without movement eg pushing against a brick wall is isometric hope this helps
i was reading some reviews of the quiet man '' earlier this year and a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children grandchildren and i imagine great grandchildren in that league of the timeless you have to put a story of love redemtion compassion revenge retribution foregiveness and tranquility in an epic truly larger than life if we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago then certainly william wyler 's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view for me seeing it again and again i am always startled by heston 's skills as an actor often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence here the antagonist is stephen boyd judah 's best friend from childhood now addicted to the narcotic of power the two will clash this is the time of christ 's ministry christ is seen as a rabble rouser and rome an international giant the world had never seen seeks to thwart that message by girding up jerusalem so they send the now goal oriented and vicious messala to the home of heston is also supported ably by jack hawkins a brilliant actor in his prime as the roman counsel quintus arrius judah sentenced to virtual death on the roman galleys survives a battle with the macedonians to only save quintus arius i say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene the arrival of quintus arrius in rome a hero with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman judah william wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as jack hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before ceasar there must be 100 steps ! and the camera back away to see hawkins in his magenta robe draped over the pure white stairs climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire in spartacus '' also a fine movie a few years later the script tells you about the size of the roman empire here in this one scene wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word at the same time judah remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs looks around and in that one expression on heston 's face of awe and the size and the power of century rome he amplifies the scene of hawkins climbing the staircase a great great move well worth your time if you have never seen it well worth your time again if you have 5 stars larry scantlebur
this is an outstanding dvd i highly recommend it if you have seen riverdance live you can relive the great moments if you have n't seen riverdance live you are in for a real treat with this dvd from the comfort of your own home

for all true dream theater fans this is a must have dvd ! the only drawback to score '' that i found was that they did n't play never enough '' but that should n't prevent you from purchasing score '' i have watched the dvd over 10 times already and it has n't gotten old for
for those who were fans of the show when it was originally aired all i can say is that you wo n't be disappointed this series is one of my all time favorite tv shows when i discovered it was on dvd i snapped it up right away the picture quality and sound is much better than the on air cable signal version i originally saw this is the first tv series i have ordered on dvd and i was afraid the picture quality would be vhs boy was i wrong this series looks as good as any hollywood movie dvd i have ever purchased if you have never seen this series but liked the space marines in the second aliens movie then you will probably really like this series
my kids just love this movie barbie in the 12 dancing princesses it is a very clean movie it is not scary except for the mean duchess but she really is n't scary just mean it teaches about honesty and family and how they care about each other which is really good for children to see plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch
before we first rented one of the barbie videos for my daughter i was expecting them to be trite and however i have been pleasantly surprised yes they do have a lot of commercial and a high saccarine count but the quality of the barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented including 12 dancing princesses '' was significantly higher than i had expected they have not just kept my children engrossed for hours including my son as well as my daughter but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music on more than one occasion i have been listening to a cd of a classic such as beethoven 's pastoral symphony or the queen of the night 's aria from mozart 's magic flute and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music and correctly remembered which barbie film had used it magic of pegasus '' and mermaidia '' respectively the soundtrack to twelve dancing princesses '' is mostly adapted from some of mendelsohn 's best work including a midsummer night 's dream '' and the scottish and italian symphonies it also includes a lullaby sung to the king by the 12 princesses which was based on a century anthem by byrd the recording of which was sung beautifully by melissa lyons and the women 's occidental glee club the story is loosely based on the children 's story barbie '' plays princess genevieve '' the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed king seven young women plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6 like the original the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night however in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the king their father who loves them very much but his cousin duchess rowena who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor at first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was as with many of the barbie films comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters in this case princess genevieve has a pet cat and the evil duchess rowena has an equally evil pet monkey brutus the hero who in this version is the royal cobbler derek has a pet parrot who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated indian accent that 's indian from the subcontinent not native american those people who enjoy criticising what the barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at if you or more importantly your kids are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness then this film and the barbie videos generally may not be for them and the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility i 'm not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is that is a concern with this film but on the plus side it is beautifully made it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour 's rest after doing so alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you wo n't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring and best of all the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it 's own

a french art film that i rented while on vacation despite rave reviews all over the packaging this story of two moody teenage girls growing apart as sexuality enters their lives seemed pretty slow and predictable even a bit tedious jet lag set in and we gave up of the way through the film and took it back the next day in all fairness this is probably a fine film if you 're in the mood for serious art but i found it a bit dreary
this is a really scary movie i 've always put on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever but this movie surpasses that movie i did n't expect much seeing the title of the movie which does n't sound scary at all but was i wrong dead wrong if you are a horror fan you got to see this movie the terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck asian horror movies do n't rely on gore but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops contemporary american horror movies do n't scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks asian horror movies like this one which is korean is not an original idea but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better other asian titles i recommend are dark water and the red shoes
a fun musical comedy the trouble with girls is n't the usual elvis presley film but it 's completely charming with it 's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast presley plays walter hale manager of the traveling chautauqua '' circa 1927 who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show hale finds himself falling in love with charlene marlyn mason organiser of the children 's activities whilst trying to help local single mother nita bix sheree north when she murders her nasty married boyfriend dabney coleman presley 's numbers include swing down sweet chariot '' and clean up your own backyard '' it 's certainly a lot better than some of the other elvis films from the same period and seeing elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat marlyn mason probably one of presley 's most formidable is stunning and her rendition of sign of the zodiac '' is a knockout nicole jaffe as the amorous hotel clerk vincent price eccentric speaker mr morality '' john carradine as a colourful shakespearian actor joyce van patten disgruntled former channel swimmer maude and edward andrews as hale 's beleaguered assistant are also fine fans of classic tv shows should keep an eye out for anissa jones family affair '' and susan olsen the brady bunch ''
i really enjoyed this movie death warrant was filled with supense and action van damme portrays officer louis burke who goes undercover to investigate murder and corruption in the prison system eventually officer burke meets up with a convicted murderer that he had arrested and put behind bars i did not lose interest with the nonstop suspense and action sincerely renee ra
fargo '' is a very good film the cohen brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film the film stars jerry lundegaard william macy as a car salesman in dire need of money when he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom things go from bad to worse i could n't help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers the father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom and decides to act on his own jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess moreover he has a saavy police chief mcdormand on the case the film is a definite as many of the cohen brother 's films are this one is a bit more disturbing than usual however hot on the case is a policewoman marge gunderson frances mcdormand she is witty and intelligent and knows something is not right steve buscemi stars as one of the kidnappers and his partner has a few loose marbles the film is a delightful at times funny film that is highly recommended moreover there are many colorful and funny character actors in the film which only enhance the films appeal there are also some disturbing scenes however the film is well worth the watch and purchase highly recommended stars 4.5
i thought the film was great it has a interesting storyline it also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on i do n't understand why people will rate this movie so low is it cuz it does n't have a established in it that it is n't some mainstream unoriginal film which even the most moronic of morons can grasp listen do n't rate this movie low if it does n't seem good to you because it requires thinking unlike the mainstream films in the theaters you stay to your pablum mainstream films and leave those people who work hard on indie films alone for the people who complained the girls were dressed too little i 've seen many more hollywood films where women wear nothing but string bikinis basically these girls were dressed for a majority of the film for the person who said ashley was plump '' you must really like your women to be anorexic
i did this workout for the very first time today and i do n't think i 've felt ever felt this good about myself this dvd works it 's not high impact aerobics but i do n't think i 've ever sweat that much in one workout before and i totally disagree with whoever said the breaks every twenty minutes makes you sleepy i 'm not in very good shape so i need those breaks to be able to do the entire workout i did n't think i 'd like this dvd because it is one of the longer ones ana and ravi put out i am really really looking forward to getting the other two fat free dvds to add to my collection
i think this is a great film many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it 's running time 128 minutes insisting it 's too slow almost all of clint 's films the ones he 's directed run long the running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours the longest being bird at 2 hours 40 minutes sure the film is n't pc but it was made in 1975 when you did n't have to be pc but there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film these are nervewracking and incredibly authentic clint did all his own stunts in these sequences and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences and they are very intense to watch because you know the actors are really up there no cgi in those days this is one of the reasons they work so well cgi looks fake anyway it makes movies seem like cartoons people know it is n't real cgi reliance should be reduced in hollywood as it takes the tension out of action scenes check this film out it 's worth all of its 128 minutes
recently realizing that jackie chan and jet li are about done with movie making for the most part i always wondered if there was anyone who could take over chan and li are one of a kind and the best out there fortunately tony jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own the first thing i like about tony jaa is he is an expert in muay thai fighting something new and original for the good guy in a movie the next thing i like is that he fights like jet li and does stunts like jackie chan though once again he adds his own originality quite often ong bak is pure action excitement do n't expect a deep story and do expect horrible english dubbing that is just down right annoying you can still switch to subtitles with thai spoken if desired if these 2 things do n't matter to you this movie just plains rocks its a bit slow here and there but overall it is filled with all the action you could want illegal club fights an incredible club brawl fight tons of stunts and chases a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars a ring fight and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts lasting for a good 10 minutes i also liked the background music for the movie lots of smooth hip hop beats i 'm pleased to say that with newcomer tony jaa to the world of martial arts films the loss of chan and li someday soon wo n't be as bad ong bak is brilliant action and originality the only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing which chan and li movies do much better
a friend of mine told me about this movie and i went to the local video store and rented it crazy ! ! ! i thought that the cgi and wire work was so smooth that it almost looked real however after watching the special features of him doing the stunts from the movie live ! ! jackie who bruce what jet whatchamacallit he is the martial arts star for the new generation for those that see the decline of martial arts movies this kid gives us hope
a hilarious movie made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you 'd find in the object of it 's spoofing top gun '' the film is loaded with abrahams 's usual puns slapstick and quick wordplay there 's always something going on in the background making for fun repeat viewings the overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience besides that it 's educational too ! you 'll never again wonder what a chafing dish is
the product is but why arewe penalised for late delivery in the form of warfage ! ! ! ! ! shurly this is wrong
this dvd was better than i could have asked for it uses footage from the tv show this week in baseball twib and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of america 's pastime it goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including tim hudson ryan dempster select phillies players many others as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as tommy lasorda and yogi berra if you love twib 's how 'bout that '' section of the show you will adore this dvd as far as i can tell every major league team is shown though some have the spotlight on them more than others this is a must have for any baseball fan it 's by far one of the best mlb dvds released in a long time
this is a sad little gem of a movie i really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love the story had as much to do with issues of identity community and fidelity in my opinion there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved especially when considering the quality of the performances the slight quiver in weisz 's voice was right on target as was perez 's accent the rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable considering the type of story and the setting i ca n't help but think that a would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film i emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character
i have watched the first disk of the tick and i laughed my ass off ! ! i am working on getting a copy of it in order to send it to comedy central and requst that they air the first season on their channel i think that fox screwed up by cancelling this show and that comedy central should pick it up it is by far the best show i have seen in awhile and deserves to be resurrected ! ! thank you
i 'm the kind of guy who takes out large clumps of grass with every swing no matter what club i use it 's so bad that my so called '' friends would n't even go to the range with me anymore because i embarrassed them too much i was the butt of all the jokes at the office too i already had a closet full of vhs tapes and a few dvds i 've spend hundreds on my local golf pro '' and i 've been reading magazines for years but i just never could figure out the what where and whys of my game a friend recommended this set so i got one and it 's been great i could easily understand and follow alone with the tips so well that i must have watched all the tips in one weekend and after only a few rounds i could finally start to understand what 's going on with each drive approach and putt i hit and that 's helped me improve enough that my friends are playing with me again in my opinion anyone would find these dvds helpful even my local golf pro '' would benefit from this collection however i 'm not sure i 'll give away my new edge to all my friends '' at least until i can cut a few more strokes and they have to play catch up
martin short joins the cast in this volume securing this show 's enduring genius and originality the cast brilliant as always never fail to deliver i grew up watching this show and what a thrill to have it on dvd i feel like they have finally come home ! ! ! woo hoo ! !

visually aurally this is a feast ! great musicianship excellent lighting colour camera angles etc etc if you know like pat know the piece you wo n't be really disappointed but the reason it 's not for me is a combination of 2 things relatively insignificant in themselves but together worth knocking off a star first there 's no intro the first note is struck with the title screen still showing no pictures of the band standing taking the crowd 's ovation the credits start rolling straight after the last note i always find it nice to get a sense of the atmosphere location occasion before and after the music starts playing second those familiar with the piece will be aware of the extraordinary interplay closing out part two well i 'm not sure if this is in the playing or sound on the night or the dvd mixing but as the sound builds the trumpet dynamic gets a bit lost all you really hear as an individual voice is the guitar synth great of course but could 've been even better ! this said for a pat product still means a must buy '' !
'the bunker ' is one of three films that deal with hitler 's final days as the soviets encircle berlin and put an end to the third reich in 1945 'the bunker ' is both one of the best and one of the worst of the three the others being 1973 's 'hitler the last ten days ' and 2005 's 'downfall ' at the same time the triumph of 'the bunker ' is anthony hopkins tour de force performance as hitler at times so exact it is as if you are watching a newsreel the element that makes the film almost painful to watch is that almost a of it is dedicated to the whitewashing of convicted nazi war criminal albert speer one thing that makes 'the bunker ' different from the others is the occasional use of flashbacks and although brief they do allow hopkins to portray hitler in different venues and in a relaxed mode casually chating and enjoying the company of friends when times were fat in the bunker itself hopkins turns hitler purple in a full throttle rage as he yells about the need to destroy the scourge and pestilence of jewish marxism ! '' 'hitler the last ten days ' does a bit better than the rest in portraying the supporting cast of characters in the drama but one stands out in 'the bunker ' and that is michael lonsdale as martin borman hitler 's personal secretary and gatekeeper a man of considerable power who plays his cards close to the vest and is always scheming to stay one step ahead of his rivals despite its flaws 'the bunker ' earns a high rating as the hopkins performance simply can not be missed
this is a fantastic video i use it regularly for teaching it gives a wonderful sophisticated view of chuck close as an individual and an artist as well as a glimpse of the other artist 's work who are interviewed in the video it is filmed in a very immediate and personal style there is nothing stiff boring or disconnected about it common faults of many art videos anyone who has experienced a similar tragedy in their family will find the discussion of chuck 's event '' very moving and not at all sappy
bergman first introduced us to johan and marianne in his 1974 masterpiece scenes from a marriage one of the cinema 's most exacting dissections of our failure to connect bergman and the splendid scandanavian actors erland josephson and liv ullmann took us through johan and marianne 's marriage divorce and reconciliation in the end they live apart but still make room for the bond between them three decades later bergman josephson and ullmann have given us saraband a gift marianne decides that even though she has n't seen johan since the it 's time to make contact again johan has inherited money from an aunt and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake she literally wakes him with a kiss but soon enough marianne 's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in johan 's family henrik johan 's son is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter karin both of them still mourn anna henrik 's wife and karin 's mother who died two years before henrik a music teacher is preparing karin an accomplished cellist for her conservatory entrance exams the elderly johan remains but charismatic not unlike bergman 's own father and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him henrik wants his father 's affection and acceptance even though johan refuses to give it ostensibly due to some slight by henrik when he was 19 years old in a painful scene henrik goes to johan to ask for money to help karin and in his 61 year old face we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his father for karin her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father karin struggles to figure out what she owes henrik what she owes to the memory of her mother and what she owes to herself she lets marianne see some but not all of the turmoil she 's going through for marianne her attraction to johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him she 's always wanted something from him but since she ca n't define what it is she 'll probably never get it the struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by marianne 's opening and closing monologues karin makes her choices henrik reacts marianne throws herself once more against johan 's emotional aloofness as he 's done throughout his brilliant career bergman brings it alive through artful dialog perfect dramatic timing and riveting cinematic composition the characters are not always likable but they are never less than engrossing the criterion 's dvd includes a of bergman making saraband we watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking kid around with the crew poke and prod his actors into position it 's a treat to watch him work one wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from julia dufvenius the fine young actress who plays karin one also wonders why bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he 'd announced he was through bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection apparently he wants to say one last thing about it which seems to be this after all the tears and shouting all the posturing and cruelty all the reaching out and pulling back this is what remains marriages of true minds the photo of anna used in the film is a picture of bergman 's great love his deceased wife ingrid the fraught ties of fathers and sons memories of old loves what you give and get from children and the devolution of the flesh none of it is easy the master tells us but all of it is necessary in the end it 's all you have what 's truly sad is that bergman sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey claims that he 's done he did for film what shakespeare did for theater took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving he will certainly be missed and he ca n't be replaced but do n't see saraband for nostalgic reasons it 's a moving insightful film that deserves a place in the director 's canon saraband stands on its own but it 's a deeper experience if you watch scenes from a marriage first
the enduring legacy around truffaut 's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from novel and in showing that elusive rapport oskar werner henri serre and especially jeanne moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the french new wave fortunately the criterion collection dvd set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times the story focuses on the friendship between two writers an austrian named jules and a frenchman named jim kindred spirits who enjoy a decadent lifestyle in paris inspired by a statue of a woman 's face with a most enigmatic smile they agree that they are destined to fall in love with a woman with the same smile enter catherine as seductively capricious a as ever there was in cinema and the two men are instantly enamored jules is intent on marrying her even though it 's clear from the outset that she is not one who could commit for the long term the war intercedes and the two friends are fighting on opposite sides after the war catherine married to jules and raising their young daughter is emotionally dissatisfied and embarks on an affair with jim with jules ' blessing things are idyllic for a while but jim proves too much the alpha male to defer to catherine 's whims and the resulting imbalance leads to increasingly dramatic consequences in just his third film truffaut 's trademark style emerges with fast cuts between scenes and naturalistic camera movements courtesy of raoul coutard 's fluid cinematography moreover george delerue 's animated music score and michel subor 's voiceover add to the evocative memory atmosphere at times the storyline feels a bit disjointed but the fulsome performances more than compensate werner fully captures the internal struggle within jules in attempting to reconcile his love for catherine with her impossible demands on him serre has the comparatively more objective role but convincingly shows his character surrendering to the tangled situation after her impressive turn as an obsessed adulterer in louie malle 's elevator to the gallows '' moreau solidifies her vaunted reputation here conveying catherine 's petulance and unyielding passion in a vividly mercurial fashion the dvd extras are abundant starting with two commentary tracks the first one a more factual account of the production was recorded in 1992 with truffaut collaborator suzanne schiffman editor claudine bouche jean gruault and scholar annette insdorf the second produced in 2000 is far better as it has moreau sharing her personal recollections of the filming with truffaut biographer serge toubiana disc one also includes a brief 1966 interview with truffaut discussing and a 1985 featurette the key to jules and jim '' which contains interviews with the author 's friends as they discuss the inspirations for the characters disc two takes a broader look at truffaut with five separate interviews with the director over the span of fifteen years as well as insightful interviews with coutard and jean gruault
i 'll tell ya if i read one more review written by someone born after 1980 dissing bakshi i think i 'm going to start kicking rump and taking names do people diss disney hardly until they became such a movie mill that they are computer generating what used to be created by hand with a loving touch look at cool world '' as the antitoonworld of roger rabbit '' the characters are psychedelic psychotic retro and bent there is a great deal of expected sexuality and lewdness pushing the edge of the as far as it can go lots of puns and inside jokes it takes an adult to appreciate something warner cartoons were masters at granted they do n't always hit the mark here and there 's more chemistry when the doodles are on than when the noids take over but i dare anyone to watch that scene with holli cooing let 's make love '' to a sweating mel torme wannabe while she 's having trouble keeping her noidness intact and not feel the simulataneous urge to salivate and giggle the transformation of noids to doodles when the wand is removed is humorous a lounge lizard literally becomes one a cowboy becomes a horse a female lead a blank eyed orphan annie the end cap where byrne 's character becomes a dim witted but sincere superhero is happily reminiscent of captain sternn from heavy metal '' yes the acting is practically phoned in yes the plot is odd but get over it folks it 's adult animation and it 's entertaining i watch it again and again and i always laugh
trapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept they did it in saw ii house on haunted hill and then there were none and i 'm sure quite a few others but that plot seems to always work it does for me house of 9 is no exception it does n't follow a storyline that 's predictable even though the plot is not unknown there are surprises suspense thrills and tense moments believe me you wo n't predict the ending i was very satisfied with the movement of this film it 's an interesting watch
samuel jackson and kevin spacey turn two distinct yet strong performances jackson is always great to watch for his intensity and this role suits that to a tee spacey continues to impress with a solid and believable performance this film and its cast are dated by today 's standards but the two main actors and the good story more than make up for it highly worthwile
2 is better than the original i feel i should get that out of the way first since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one however i feel 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade it should naturally be better that 's what this sequel feels like a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there it 's a good film but it 's not really the way i thought a sequel should be effects are even better than the first and the tentacles of doc ock make for some truly spectacular battles including a centerpiece on a runaway train tobey maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of peter parker and has good chemistry with kirsten dunst as mary jane alfred molina has more to work with as doc ock than dafoe did as the goblin and humanizes what was once a wacky villain james franco continues to develop harry osborn well and the supporting cast like jk simmons and rosemary harris fill out the acting but the script needs work it uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot that of the hero calling it quits it 's never convincing and the film drags as we wait for peter to realize things we 've known all along character relationships though do n't seem to have progressed since the first movie we 're still treading the jane love triangle just with a different third wheel harry still has his friendship with peter there are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one for a story supposedly set 3 years later it might as well have been 3 days we get a dvd with good extras and presentation i enjoy 2 on its own and it 's nice to have it in my dvd library but as a sequel it 's not fresh enough for me hopefully next year 's 3 will fix that
had just enough tasteful sex to satisfy and oh yes the movie was good too

an absolutely wonderful film by clint eastwood thelonious was an amazing man he said things on the piano that we wordsmiths are n't able to communicate his unusual character made for an interesting subplot this film is footage of the man himself usually playing his music i 'm just sitting here being stunned
the thin man movies were funny and sophisticated when they came out and remain so it seems rare today to find such rich dialogue
anchor bay has come through again with this wonderful set of paul verhoeven 's early films all of the transfers are and the subtitles are very clear and concise as the individual titles have already been reviewed seperately the big draw to this collection is being able to collect all of these brilliant films for much less than their retail price the collectible booklet that 's included provides plot summaries and quotes from the director cast member s overall i highly recommend this collection for even the casual filmgoer who is looking for that unique film experience
great acting and development in the plot movie very heavy movie however that may be out of some people 's reach '' as to understanding and appreciation strisand and nolte were both brilliant
the tale starts out with a historical reference to chaucer for a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected and then you see the michael powell and emeric pressburger eagle that transitions us form times to present day 1944 england time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog we find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to canterbury army sergt bob johnson sergeant john sweet on his way to canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of kent he is accused of having his stripes on upside down british sgt peter gibbs dennis price is temporarily stationed at kent while staging for overseas he was and theater organ player before the war alison smith sheila sim a london store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a girl ' she seems to have an uncanny knowledge of kent and the pilgrims ' road to canterbury the night they got off the train at kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious glue man '' then befriended by the local magistrate thomas colpeper jp thomas colpeper jp colpeper is interested in the history of the pilgrims ' road from kent to canterbury until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you is the focus on a local mystery the interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves be sure to get the criterion version with the second dvd the main item besides the film is the voice over commentary by film historian ian christie which will rival the film for entertainment and after watching you may want to give the film that other star
this documentary is very concise and very straight forward it does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir it features interviews with some very credible sources all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic i really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together this documentary makes a great point and i 'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics
one of the best movies i have seen ! ! ! the subject itself forces you to look at your own limitations on anything that is out of your 'normal ' boundaries after watching this movie you have a better insight on how limited most of us are and how this causes a lot more harm than we think it does in terms of film quality it is also one of the best i have seen the actors are tremendous the characters are so accurately portrayed that you actually feel the pain of each one of them of course ludovic 's innocence is rendered beautifully but the changes that the mother goes through are very emotionally charged maybe because i am a mother myself she seems at first to be the most understanding of all when it comes to her son 's differences then goes through a confusion stage and then tries really hard to understand him but when her family 's whole life setting house husband 's job social life goes havoc she closes down emotionally on her own son which is extremely painful to watch after one final emotionally violent confrontation with ludovic she realizes that she 's loosing him and finally sees him the way it should be her beautiful child nothing more nothing less it is also filmed in a very colorful manner especially during ludovic 's escapes into dreamland which accentuate the notion of ludovic 's innocence the neighborhood setting seems to be a bit of a caricature of american suburbia green front lawns barbecue parties with an european flavor adults dancing at neighborhood parties in any case the movie seems to make a clear statement that intolerance seems to be most prominent in white surburban populations which many could find this to be a bit of a stereotype in any case i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants something more out of movie than what is presented in mainstream movies
monty python are probably the best known sketch comedian ever they made a tv show monty python 's flying circus and several hilarious movies and now for something completely different their first movie which is a collection of their best skits from their tv show this movie is hilarious it includes the lumberjack song the dead parrot sketch the dirty fork and the world funniest joke monty python and the holy grail their best movie it 's about arthur and his knights looking for the holy grail this movie will make you laugh insanely funny moments include the killer rabbit the knights who say ni and the black knight the adventures of baron munchausen this movie is not a monty python film but was made by terry gilliam and eric idle both of whom are former pythons a must have for any monty python fan this set deserves the five stars and more i recommend this to any monty python fan british comedy fan or comedy fan in general too bad it did n't inlude the meaning of life or life of brian
we have both of these although we purchased them seperately save yourself the time and money and just get them together the magical halloween adventure has characters picking out costumes to wear and then it goes into hayrides pumpkin patches carving pumpkins and making cider there is a cute songs about monsters not being scary the elmo says boo ! one has cute songs with different poeple and charcters and of course has elmo all over it we have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that in my opinion they are not scary also we watch them year round especially the elmo one she will pull it out and ask for it who knew you could have halloween in july
i spent ten years working various scenes at the trinity church hellhouse yes it is a bit campy and yes it is often over the top but i can say that the people are well intentioned just a bit off target i attended trinity church from birth until i was 22 years old i do not attend their anymore because of the attitude that is prevalant in this documentary i stopped doing hellhouse when they added the decision room my last year i just felt it was an scare tactic i now feel that way about the entire operation the worst feeling i get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves i know because i was once one of them i have found that a growing number of former trinity youth group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons i listed above this movie will open your eyes to the way teens are herded like cattle in fundamentalist christian churches
this is a movie you 'll want to watch over again a number of times for a number of reasons for one you 'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first perhaps the second and third too and even beyond as the legend goes with the exception of a few brief breathers director howard hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film 's sleek 92 minutes with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once i agree with the amazon review you 'll also want to give the movie at least one look devoted exclusively to cary grant 's performance as news chief walter burns one can only marvel at his incendiary reactions to each situational development the big scoop involves the gallows sentence of a meek little anarchist '' john qualen alleged to have killed a black cop and while ferociously tracking the story burns chats up and tries to reclaim his ace reporter hildy johnson the movie is based on hecht and macarthur 's broadway hit the front page an early version had been produced already for the silver screen but hawks decided his inspired idea of switching hildy 's gender to that of a woman justified another remake he was right of the various stage and film renditions his girl friday is regarded as the most powerful and effective use of the source material handed this basic premise scriptwriter charles lederer added one last layer of complexity hildy johnson is not just any woman but walter burns 's as the action begins she is bidding the chaotic cynical reporter 's life farewell having decided to settle down and marry an insurance man named bruce baldwin ralph bellamy perfect as the earnest foil to grant on hearing this burns hatches his plot if he can pull off the entire stunt he will beat the competition to a story on local corruption by getting hildy involved again and helping her realize the hawksian principle that you are what you do '' he will also regain a writer of rare talent these two goals alone would be enough to keep his motivation interesting but of course the chance to win back his brings a sexy tension to the frantic lunatic action the one thing you have to do is reserve a viewing strictly for watching rosalind russell as hildy in the part that literally no one wanted jean arthur claudette colbert irene dunne and carole lombard all turned it down russell succeeds in making his girl friday her movie among her colleagues in the press room played by a sterling ensemble of character actors she 's got the wit to sound right at home with the boys at the same time she stands out not just in her bold pinstriped outfits but with her unflagging dedication to the raw grind of the professional news man '' when necessary she dashes from telephone to telephone one raging conversation to the next yet in the movie 's moment of high pathos she manages to be absoltuely riveting while barely raising her voice above a whisper finally of course her kinetic scenes with grant are what earn this movie its reputation as one of the fastest funniest zingers ever produced my sole warning fork over the dough for columbia 's authorized release the 's and there are several on the market are pretty shabby in terms of image and sound quality with so much in your future do what it takes to get the best version
i do n't usually like romance films but 2046 is brilliant ! a mind trip and sensual candy ! if you have a short attention span you will not appreciate this work of art but if the first half draws you in the second half will blow your mind ! wong kar wai sets up analogies between the relationships of each character by comparing characters in this way we are given infinite perspectives on the characters and their emotions this is genius ! this is art ! full of colorful symbolism
i have ever to say for this acting great story and great n't hesitate go get will be one of the gems in your movie collection and please guys when you come to movies like this masterpiece do n't give them a 3 star beacuse it did n't have many extras or something like movie is that counts
i watched this movie in health class during a unit on ageing the movies was very touching and turned the whole class to tears but it was a great movie that was very touching and i would suggest watching it

if you have ever come across a home movies episode maybe at about 3 am on comedy central hopefully you immediately recognized the transcendent hilarity and quickly began devoting the rest of your life to enjoying more episodes if that did not happen buy the season 3 dvd 's because brendan small is just immensely funny and enjoyable the renaissance fair episode is unbelievable
there were loads of swords sorcery films coming out in the 80 's most of them low budget garbage but this was actually one of the better films it had a lot wrong with it but it had enough good to make it enjoyable richard lynch is cromwell who plots against the throne takes power as the young prince talon lee horsley eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant pretty standard stuff but it 's exectuted well the opening is stolen directly from robert howard 's conan story the hour of the dragon '' as cromwell and his conspirators including a witch find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful ancient sorcerer in the conan story the sorcerer 's name was zaltotun in this movie the name is xusia mere coincidence i think not but xusia is played well be the towering richard moll of night court fame he 's suitably imposing and evil as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life unfortunately xusia does n't get enough screen time lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here too horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by errol flynn in robin hood than by conan he 's a reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne he is eventually captured and cromwell has him nailed to a cross although it 's an x '' cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism again this is a scene lifted from a conan story a witch shall be born '' when conan was nailed to a cross only conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while talon actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately now i 'm no doctor but i 'm guessing that someone who had a 4 '' nail driven through their palms is not going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but ok it 's fantasy so i 'll buy it still despite some shortcomings this is an enjoyable little diversion the ending credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized
the technical quality of the dvd is excellent my interest in the movie is the result of seeing a photo on a friend 's wall of charlie chaplin and an actor the actor hugh sasson was the uncle of my friend 's mother he appears early in the movie as the person who has his pocket picked the photo is the shot in front of the hot dog stand when the victim sees the tramp paying for a hot dog out of his wallet we set the photo on the tv and stepped through this scene on the dvd one frame at a time it gave us all goose bumps as somehow the extreme slow motion made them seem alive in real time additionally the story of the production difficulties found on disk 2 are fascinating
first off if it has pauly shore it is pretty much guaranteed to be funny in this comedy pauly shore and his buddy sign up to be in the reserves because they need the money little does he know when he picks their area of expertise water clarifacation that it is something that will actually be needed and they get called into active duty watch this movie
mighty quinn '' features a young sexy denzel washington xavier quinn as a smart detective who did a stint with the fbi and returns home as police chief on a carribbean island there 's a shadowy plot involving bills a guerilla movement and guns but the movie focuses more on quinn 's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder and quinn 's own discomfort from having made good '' but ending up caught between two worlds white and black he 's also caught between the islanders ' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation this film is full of sexy island women colorful reggae music and real world dilemmas of race and identity no matter that we could n't quite figure out if the plot hung together a winner
then this would be a really serious detective as it 's executed now it 's a superbly relaxed with serious undertones cool
my brother bought a used copy at wal mart and i decided to borrow it despite him saying it was stupid it is n't it 's actually real funny and entertaining
this animation is as hilarious as when it was first aired maybe even more so as the careers of some of those who sat on the good doctor 's couch have blossomed eg david cross who you may remember from such shows as arrested development even ray romano is funny the animation is great especially the new york city scenes ben katz is a scene stealer i need to see 'feng shui ' and 'sticky notes ' on dvd please
if you are at all interested in synthesizers their impact on the music world and how the moog synthesizer changed history this is a 'must have ' i just wish i had bought my copy and had bob autograph it before he passed away i did go to his memorial service a little late i admit but this dvd gives so much insight into the realm of the synth there 's a fair amount of footage from the anniversary event moogfest '' at bb king 's in nyc in may of 2004. i attended that show and was just one table from the stage right in front of keith emerson and his there is also some segments of bob and rick wakeman back stage it was rick wakeman 's birthday good stuff i would buy it if i were you i am me and i did buy it and i 'm not sorry !
i first saw dragonslayer '' when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981. it was the first vhs movie i ever purchased it 's very well made an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about it still holds up caitlin clarke 's performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job i wrote her when the film came out telling her as much and received a thank you letter i learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004 dragonslayer '' has action humor humanity political irony and if none of those matter to you it 's just plain fun
good movie with a unique storyline special effects were very good for the time of filming
other people 's money is a wonderful movie full of smart dialogue good music and a terrific danny devito performance devito is his usual funny and self while gregory peck is a patriarch very good stuff there the weakest performance is from penelope ann miller who is n't really convincing as the corporate attorney but the material is so good that it saves the movie this is a 5 star film however it loses a star because of the last scene which feels a bit tacked on otherwise a smart and funny film from the director of moonstruck
i bought a balance ball kit from another location but wanted a more complete workout than the sampler that came with the kit i like the workout a lot and i think it will be a good strengthening and toning tool i like that there is a separate relaxation workout for stress relief and i like that the workout cycles through the different body parts
the uncut version of the anime is much better than what is aired on tv though there are still some diferences between the japanese version and what is in the uncut version i would n't recomend the special edition unless you are a hard core naruto fan the bonus items that come with it are mainly geared toward younger viewers and not much towards adult viewrs
the great thing about the naruto series is it has an involved ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously the episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen it has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams my small gripes are that for some reason naruto has the catch phrase of believe it ! and it gets dropped into places that it does n't make any sense but it 's a small problem also the extras you get are really fun and high quality this is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike

i wake up screaming '' was the first film noir made at century fox its greatest distinction is its visual style whose lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after world war ii cinematographer edward cronjager created a striking early example of noir '' lighting john alton appropriately called mystery lighting '' in this film made in 1941 before the united states entered the war the story is based on the novel of the same name by stephen fisher adapted for the screen by dwight taylor who moved the action to new york gave it a flashback structure and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in hollywood that combines multiple genres mystery romance musical the singing scene was cut comedy suspense and psychological drama but the suspense does dominate when model and aspiring actress vicky lynn carole landis is murdered the police are quick to blame frankie christopher victor mature a fight promoter who met vicky when she was a waitress introduced her to all the right people and managed her ascent to glamour girl she left him for hollywood vicky 's sister jill betty grable disapproved of her career choice but does n't want to believe frankie responsible for her death the assistant district attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator elisha cook at the lynns ' apartment building is the killer but sadistic police detective ed cornell laird cregar wo n't let up on frankie constantly harassing and threatening him leaving frankie little choice but to find the killer himself i wake up screaming '' opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape that got my attention then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station frankie christopher is harshly lit with one lamp surrounded by police officers in the shadows gorgeous dramatic lighting the faces of some characters even frankie are sometimes completely blacked out i do n't know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it 's deliberate but it 's daring everywhere we go in the station house there are bars and shadows the implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming the police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic this really surprised me in such an early film but it 's fabulous this was betty grable 's first role she 's all sweetness and goodness but she is also practical and brave in the mold of a film noir unfortunately every time she appears on screen we hear somewhere over the rainbow '' which eventually drove me a little nuts victor mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist but the performance comes from laird cregar as the very creepy obsessed police detective cornell he 's truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains the dialogue is n't except for a few lines delivered by vicky but i wake up screaming '' is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering hollywood 's visual vocabulary the dvd century fox 2006 a few scenes show some white specks and lines but this print is generally good sound is good bonus features a deleted scene called daddy '' 4 min in which betty grable sings this does n't fit the tone of the movie well so it was best left out hot spot '' text is a brief account of the film 's title change from i wake up screaming '' to hot spot '' and back again we can watch the opening credits for the film with the hot spot '' title 1 min there are 3 still galleries '' a poster gallery 3 posters a production stills gallery of photos 8 and a unit photography gallery of publicity stills 38 photos it 's interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself there is a theatrical trailer 2 min film noir historian eddie muller delivers a good nearly constant audio commentary he compares the screenplay to steven fisher 's novel provides background information for many of the creative crew and actors discusses the noir visual style and the juxtaposition of light and dark thematic elements in the film muller speaks a lot about the people involved in the film as always subtitles for the film are available in english and spanish
feature alice wu 's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling unforced humor and a trio of winning performances with a conflicted protagonist at its core the film shares the same territory as ol parker 's imagine me and you '' and ian iqbal rashid 's overly cute a touch of pink '' wu however manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes the plot focuses on wil short for wilhelmina an obviously talented surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional chinese family living across the east river in flushing referred to just as ma '' in the story her mother is a widowed beautician who only speaks mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her wil 's eyes nevertheless are set squarely on a comely ballerina named vivian who happens to be the daughter of wil 's supervising surgeon at the hospital meantime ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home ma moves in with wil and the inevitable consequences ensue there are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads as wil michelle krusiec is a terrific find evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times lynn chen is saucy and inviting as vivian though i wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable culminating in the inevitable scene despite the beauty of her younger joan chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning yet she is able to convey the necessary brittle distanced manner as ma making her character 's process more rewarding the ending is on the pat side especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a riff on the graduate '' but it does n't compromise the charm of the piece special mention should go to harlan bosmajian 's cinematography which captures the saturated colors found in the community the 2005 dvd contains wu 's thoughtful commentary on a separate track as well as several deleted scenes a standard featurette and a rather dull sundance video diary
scenes from a marriage is a swedish film by ingmar bergman to me this is one of the best films ever it not only captures a great story but it is done so well what makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel act and generally take care of issues this is n't one of those american films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them in here as he is telling his wife about this other lover she is without emotions just staring off with no real reactions whatsoever a way most would respond this is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is it is later that she finds outs that perhaps the marriage is n't so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce there the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage he later says he 's been with a woman for a while now and shortly there after leaves her after a year of so they get together to sign the divorce papers which turns out rough at the end after some time they get together again and in some way fall in love once again even though both are married to other people there the movies ends great film ! hard to watch some american films now because most just seem horrible and in ways corny i 'm glad i got to see a great film like this

threshold starring carla gugino special guest catherine bell episode 11 outbreak i loved this show i liked it when it was on cbs and i like it even more now that i got the dvd 's with the unaired shows to at least try to bring it to some sense of a conclusion carla gugino was very good as usual playing a strong woman named molley anne caffrey a contingency analayst who 's job it is to come up with worst case scenarios for any natural or disaters earthquake hurricanes wwiii epidemics worldwide finacial depression you get the picture the one she is called upon for is for a scenario named threshold '' hence the name of the show threshold is the contengency plan for alien invasion her job is now to put the plan in motion to quickly assemble a team made up of a physian a an areonautics engineer and navy seal whose job it is to implement the orders she gives out usually via military force or other covert means and to protect the red team '' and asscess the threat and plan how to stop the threat the actors who played the other members on molly 's team were all good and i believed and cared for them all but this review is about carla and catherine so i will get to the point carla owned the show she carried it off just like she did in karen sisco '' she told a great story and added importance to a very well done show i really do believe she is one of the best and underrated actresses in the business today and she was just stunningly beautiful every time she was on camera you could not help but to focus on her the camera loved her the beauty made you look her way but the acting the way she carried herself made you stay focused on her catherine bell was on the episode outbreak '' this episode was about about how molly and her team discovered that one of the ways the aliens could spread and infect people was through the food supply now they already knew this a few episodes before but they thought they took care of it but they were wrong molley needed to know exactly how they spread it to what foods and how long did it take effect on people who ate it so she basically drafted catherine bell and made her apart of the team whether she wanted to or not catherine bell played daphene larsons an expert on botony and biology who figured out that some foods were more likely to get it and that it was mainly tomatos and food like it that they need to worry about i 'm afraid catherine did not get much to work with here and she was only on it for that epsiode and only mentioned it the rest i was told that had the show been picked up and went the next year she would have been a full blown cast member but catherine like carla was stunningly beautiful however she does not have the same presence as carla does when she on camera she did a good job but she had next to nothing to work with and there was no essence within her or her character 's personality that took over when you got over her looks as opposed to carla when she was on carla was on her game and stayed on it it was her show catherine did the best she could with what little she had she was not on her game but it was n't her show carla and catherine had really no interaction together the only one they kinda had was when molly was briefing daphene on threshold and the story thus far and that was done with daphine sitting in a chair looking confused and while molly stood in front of her and explained it all and it was all done using cross fade and fade edits i appreciated the effects nice touch but i would have liked to see some real dialogue there i 'm pretty sure had there been an episode 14 they would have done something together like i do n't know kick some alien butt together or kissed in conclusion i loved the show then tension kept me going and seemed real it was n't neardy and though it was scfi i really did'nt get that feeling there was more to the story it was intellegently done and i wanted more but they cancelled it the last epsiode did however give it some closeuer so you do n't feel too cheated buying one season of the show it left you having enough questions as to where you wanted to see more but could still come up with your own conclusions they ended it like they could add more to the story at a later date in a form of a movie or another show but if they never do then i guess it is still okay the show was supposed to last three years going in accordance to molly 's scernario 1. threshold we have spotted and accessed the threat 2. foothold they have established themselves on earth we have notified the public and began to stop them by any means necessary probably what season 2 would have been called 3. stranglehold if it get to this point it either means we have stopped them and sent them home or they have won and anhilated us season three title i suppose she never came up with a stage i guess it would be pointless
cbs 's threshold held the promise of a good thriller however regardless of it 's interesting story premise good acting and well supported production team it like nbc 's surface '' and abc 's invasion '' was cancelled although i considered it the weakest of the three mentioned it alone was told before production ended it was not being hence it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why i rated it 4 vice 3 stars was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb possibly but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube 's reality '' shows and less than funny comedies was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting maybe but carla gugino molly charles dutton blaylock brent spiner fenway rob benedict lucas peter dinklage ramsey and brian holt cavennaugh did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters sadly they did n't have the opportunity to finish the job was it cancelled because it did n't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes arguably but the team did offer some great visuals interesting plotlines and nightmare scenarios so why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer does n't appreciate a good story takes time to develop the alias 24 law order csi smallville numbers is it worth buying or renting yes though a cancelled series it has that one thing most of it 's one season wonders do n't have an adequate conclusion that does n't leave you wondering how a is to be resolved
do n't be fooled by stupid commercials that make this movie look inappropriate or like soap operas this movie is awsome and not at all about the guys chasing the girls inappropriate behavior or anything it 's definitely worth seeing and watching again great movie
an excellent total body toning workout by two motivating and instructors this is a perfect workout to add to any workout regime highly recommend this
i 've been encouraged by pat metheny 's music since 1980 that 's a long time to follow one guy 's music track but through it all he has always grown and done more than you would expect his trio record set the standard in the early days with bright size life jaco and bob moses and his pmg work has been unusual and different and refreshing one reviewer mentions cheesy tunes '' in what sense in the sense that they do n't conform to a rigid set of jazz sounds that we 've come to expect bass x y and great jazz musicians are innovators and what pmg has done consistently through its life and continues to do is to create it 's own genre of music unto itself completely unique are you going to find 14 other groups sounding like this no way not even one i know cheesy music when i hear it and there are plenty of mainstream jazz artists that are guilty of it in addition to the usual suspects most jazz musicians will be remembered as that guy or gal that sounded kind of like miles or kind of like coltrane or brecker or whatever the great ones are the ones others are compared to and pat metheny falls in that category if you are to creative music and want to enjoy great musicians at the top of their game creating art together as a team listening well and bringing fresh new ideas to life then buy or rent this dvd if you want to hear what one kid from missouri who was by age 15 determined to play with gary burton and he did was able to do with the guitar by just doggedly pursuing it year after year creating fresh new material taking the beauty of the guitar to new levels each and every year then listen to this dvd and be a part of his history because pat is one of the true geniuses of our age his relationship with lyle mays persists to this day what a story of loyalty working together though a lifetime and pat is able to draw more talent out of his musicians than most bandleaders a lot of jazz artists have used richard bona over the years as a talented fretless bass player but pat metheny gave him a stage to share the whole range of his talent he does a solo with himself and some percussion and a delay pedal that is amazing he harmonizes with himself and creates a tapestry of sound cuong vu did something similar on this dvd with his trumpet the drummer and bass player antonio sanchez and steve rodby are just on it this is a great band if you get a chance to hear their austin city limits performance i think it is slightly better in the sense of how raw it is this performance is more polished and of course a lot more time was taken in the mastering of this both live performances are worth checking out
i first watched this incredible group of musicians i believe on austin city limits and was totally taken in by the magic these guys perform along with very very good camera work which complimented their every move pat 's fascials are captured intensly as well as all of the musicians the performance is flawless and you will find yourself feeling as if you are here '' bravo ! ! bobby gee florida
i 've been doing pilates for several months along my daily yoga practice and it 's been an incredible and effective addition to my program ! at this point i have collected about 17 pilates programs along my 90 yoga programs and there are certain teachers that have shone above the rest for me moira stott is one of those special teachers that has a way of communicating so clearly and putting together such sound practices that i always look forward to spending time with her programs i had purchased the four dvd pack basics '' fit and firm '' secret to flat abs '' and sculpt and tone '' and just this morning did fit and firm '' for the first time for someone brand new to pilates i highly recommend the basics '' dvd it 's the single best beginners i 've worked with since starting pilates as always moira starts with detailed explanations and warm ups and with the help of a student who demonstrates beautifully leads you through a wonderful well paced pilates practice this practice basically follows the intermediate pilates series with some additional advanced poses added in as well it 's about 45 minutes long but flows so beautifully that the time really flies by some people find moria stott to be dry or boring but i find her to be a pleasure to practice with perhaps because i 'm from a yoga background daily for the past nine years i 'm used to teachers who are less rah rah '' i also do n't like blaring music when i 'm practicing yoga or pilates so moira 's approach fits me well if you like teachers who have a more hyper in your face '' personality then this may not be a good fit for you but if you want a teacher who knows her stuff and who will guide you in a way that is sound and effective then moira stott is someone you will truly appreciate on so many levels other teachers whose teaching style i really enjoy are hilary burnett her intermediate program is incredible and jennifer kries i also like ana caban and michelle dozois for variety in my practice highly recommended !
i really ejoyed this ca n't wait to watch it christmas flick has a great angle and a wonderfull always liked the traditional holiday movies '' white christmas holiday inn '' now surviving christmas '' is included

this is a fantastic keith urban video my favorites would undoubtedly be somebody like you '' and raining on sunday '' i wondered why keith was n't barefooted in the where the blacktop ends '' video SMILE even so it 's a great dvd worth adding to your collection ! my only disappointment was that there was n't a video of you 'll think of me

definitely a great movie rules of engagement brings to the screen two stories as they unfold simultaneously that of a military investigation into whether an officer in the marines was in violation of the code of conduct during an incident in yemen and the inner struggle of the lawyer as he tries to come to terms with his past and the ghosts that have been haunting him ever since vietnam the film combines drama action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind needless to say tommy lee jones samuel jackson and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! the plot the setting the dialogues the special effects and the music are all wonderful ! in short it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection if you have n't already done so ! ! strongly recommended along with black hawk down a few good men and courage under fire
unlike marshall fine who wrote the amazon review i do n't find the subplot in this movie hard to swallow at all ! sadly politically i believe many of our fine military personnel have been sacrificed through the years for political agenda and i am not just talking about recently i am sure there are flaws in the movie but i was n't watching the movie for flaws truthfully military movies are not my favorite genre having said that i found myself up very late one night and happened upon '' this fine movie i was mesmerized tommy lee jones and samuel jackson were brilliant but it was the short segment with the former officer in the north vietnamese army that riveted my attention more than any other scene just brilliant ! i ca n't say more or i will spoil it for anyone who has not seen it needless to say i give it 5 stars because it is a movie that made me think one i will talk about in years to come that 's a barometer for my !
i 'd seen this film before in a lesser unrestored edition and was n't that impressed sure there 's some moments worth a chuckle or two but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull hardly the unintentional laugh riot it 's reputed to be thanks to mike nelson 's biting commentary however now the film really is funny damn funny which is why i demand we pass legislation the sooner the better requiring mike nelson commentaries on every major dvd release from here on out he may be hollywood 's last best hope the only man who can save excrement like mission impossible 3 and lady in the water from heading straight to the bargain racks okay maybe i 'm overrating mike 's abilities just a bit nothing short of an old miracle could scrape the stink off of lady in the water but if lucas gave him a crack at episodes i think we 'd be looking at pure marketing gold c'mon lucas you know you ca n't resist any excuse to yet another dvd version of your little sextology give the man a call
ok folks this is by far one of the best dvds i 've bought in quite awhile you get so much for so little first you get the original black and white movie reefer madness is like the three stooges black and white just adds to its charm but to see it in color is quite a hoot the smoke is purple and pink the suits and dresses are loud and the color scheme for mae 's apartment is just mind boggling what more could you ask for well you get more anyway when i discovered that mike nelson from fame actually had narrating duty i just had to buy reefer madness again he 's hilarious sure it would have been great for his two robot buddies to join in but who knows maybe someday mike was right on the ball and i laughed out loud quite a few times i never noticed before how much time the dope dealer spent making meals and eating well if that was n't enough we also get a short 15 minute film starring grandpa ganja he 's a marijuana expert who 's been smoking pot for over 30 years he quotes weed from the bible convincingly explains how moses was a major dopehead and also the disciples not only do we get an indepth history on marijuana he demonstrates how to roll a joint smoke a bong and other helpful hints on how to administer medical thc the old man is hilarious on helpful hints as to buying and growing your marijuana when they showed the real old dude throwing marijuana seeds over his fence and then harvesting pot in his neighbor 's yard i lost it low brow pot humor true but in any case i laughed my butt off if you already have a black and white copy of reefer madness it 's worth buying again to have this edition it 's well worth it
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it has it all suspense good acting good story line and without much violence the plot is interesting it keeps you guessing and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat great job hollywood to all involved with this film especially jodi foster
cary grant audrey hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes james coburn and a killer '' soundtrack by henry mancini deserve much better treatment than they get in this dvd with absolutely no special features this comic murder mystery shows off its stars to their finest in spite of a less than admirable film transfer it 's all thanks to the great performances tongue in cheek direction and witty screenplay hopefully a better quality and enhanced dvd version will replace this one in your film library nonetheless charade '' remains a charming and timeless classic
up until now basic instinct '' has always been that little movie in pop culture in which sharon stone uncrosses her legs and exposes her vagina for an instant after watching this movie that is exactly what i 'll remember it for this movie is pop culture staple it 's stupid and impossible to predict as soon as you think you 've got it you do n't only to discover you do as we we see with the ending the movie what critics refer to as a bad movie '' and it is however people will forget gandhi '' the best picture winner of 1980 something before they forget this movie if you label your dvd collection this would definitley be in the guilty pleasure '' section where you would also find movies like wild things '' and cruel intentions '' it 's a movie that has big stars a big budget and a stupid story but this all works perfectly oscar winner michael douglas best actor wall street plays detective nick curran an and smoker who 's investigating the murder of a former rock star the person believed to have commited the murder is catherine tramell stone a novelist who 's novel has detailed the killing exactly as nick discovers more about the case he finds simalar incidences involving catherine and at the same time he begins an affair with her probably not the best thing to do when you 're pretty damn sure she 's killing people with ice picks the movie is packed with cliches and occasional bad dialouge that is only annoying sometimes oddly enough douglas and stone are perfect in their roles stone catches the feroscity sexuality and glamour of catherine perfectly and douglas plays the vulnerable yet tough cop perfectly as well i ca n't see another actor in any of these roles which is one of the highest compliments i think an actor can recieve while it looks like douglas made the smart decision by not returning for the sequel i look forward to seeing stone playing catherine tramell again in the movie so film buffs who actually know what a best boy grip is probably wo n't like this movie but entertainment seekers will surely like it and hell if you do n't even care if it 's a good movie the sex scenes are great in reality however very entertaining
i have a little brother who is 7 and severely disabled he 's on a 9 month old level not much catches his eye but one day when he was throwing a tantrum i put it on nick jr and noticed he stopped crying when he heard the sound of the singing backyardigans he could n't stop looking at the colorful show is a lifesaver ! it kept him entertained for the whole i 'd heard about the show from a friend who has a 1 yr old who loves the show and she told me to try it out i took her advice and my brother loved it ! and as soon as i saw it on vhs i bought loves the snow fort '' but his favorite is the yeti '' he laughs the whole time the penguin sings the yeti stomp '' i also bought him it great to be a ghost '' dvd for recommend this for any little children it works like a charm
this is the masterpiece of atheist spanish film director an unrelentless devastating unmerciful criticism of religion yes it can be viewed as a social satire a political vehicle etc that 's what makes it a great film that you can view it from different perspectives to me the most valuable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see as in a wide canvass the soul and mind of this great atheist man it is revealing that took to the task of proving '' religion wrong and absurd with so intense passion and would even desperation because no one is more desperate than he who searches and ca n't find but as unamuno would say to explain the angst of the author it comes from seeking to believe with the reason and not with the life the film depicts spain 's social condition pretty accurately in those years unamuno explains this aspect though he wrote decades before 's work as follows in france and spain there are multitudes who have proceeded from rejecting popery to absolute atheism because 'the fact is that false and absurd doctrines when exposed have a natural tendency to beget scepticism in those who received them without reflection none are so likely to believe too little as those who have begun by believing too much ' '' another important aspect of the film is the way he depicts the poor helplessly incorrigible lacking as much in money as in human virtues and extremely ugly and repealing it is very curious how did not even allow any little space for sentimentality or candidness i mean there is no hero or anything even close to it it 's a terrible portrait of the human soul i would say pessimistic but i do n't think would agree he would probably prefer sincere or realistic the symbolism is so evident that any private school kid could figure it out so forcibly paired are the scenes with their objects of criticism and trying to make it so evident and not as difficult as other of his surrealistic films evidences his intensity of feeling his anger his hatred of all that despises religion and not only catholicism just happened to be but universal religion going back to the the poor in the film being a communist sympathizer it is ironic that he does n't show even a little mercy with his poor i think the rich young man is a more admirable figure than any of his other characters the female protagonist the nun who gives up her vows being used only as a tool can not be expected to represent all nuns or all religious persons would be a case that in real life might happen isolatedly should not be used to prove a general rule it is dishonest but there is a correlation between his view of the economically poor and the christian view '' for the poor you have with you always but me you do not have always '' john is n't there something of the same nature so how can one conception of the poor lead christians to love them nevertheless knowing that they will always be around and the furious to despise them maybe not to condemn them because surely society or the rich '' would take the blame well that question is for everybody to meditate on i wish people like would give christ a chance unamuno another great spaniard says note the greater part of our atheists and you will see that they are atheists from a kind of rage rage at not being able to believe that there is a god they are the personal enemies of god '' but how can you be an enemy of someone who does not exist however this is a great and splendid work of art but now ending with a quote from rousseau where is the philosopher who would not willingly deceive mankind for his own glory with believers he is an atheist with atheists he would be a believer the essential thing is to think differently from others '' nevertheless it moves !

this dvd shows shania 's potential as a serious musician with alison krauss and union station as her back up here she is simply riveting too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like up ! '' instead of making enduring popular country classics like the woman in me '' and come on over '' maybe she 's living too well nowadays to make soulful music get this dvd if you want to hear shania doing something good 4 stars is for the short length of this dvd we need at least 2 hours of this awesome music not the 50 minutes which is on this dvd that 's only enough time to drink 5 beers
you ca n't really call yourself a pauly shore fan unless you love and it 's hard not to love this movie granted it is prone to a bit of cheesiness but this is what we both love and respect about pauly shore becca is a fresh from the farm in south dakota now in california at college and on her own for the first time she misses her family and her jock boyfriend back home and feels like she does n't fit in but crawl pauly shore in perfect pauly form her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be when the holidays roll around crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for thanksgiving but becca insists he join her and her family in south dakota crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that 's not enough to make things silly becca 's boyfriend tries to propose to her but becca does n't want to get married yet and crawl announces to the family that he 's already proposed to becca now absolute silliness takes over and it 's just so much fun from here on out if you need something fun and funny to watch give a try one of my favorites in my collection of silly comedies you 'll love it
naysayers have proclaimed this neglected gem as depressing and but perhaps they are just scared of seeing a movie starlet get truly real '' and show us the ugly truths about celebrity asia 's film would make a good double bill with dogville to make audiences realize the commonality between star worship and cannibalism argento pulls no punches she splatters herself all over each frame even introducing the film in a video prelude she should be recognized as a hero instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a exhibitionist but i bet if a man made this film these selfsame critics would line up to praise it obviously many feminists of both sexes are still secretly terrified and intimidated when a women dares to actually show her real '' self they are all the more angry because their reactions remind them they are not as ready to hear the truly liberated '' female voice as they might like to think i say asia has created something truly new with scarlet diva it 's ahead of its time and will one day be recognized as the forerunner of a brave new kind of chick flick
my daughters ages 8 and 6 like the movie but my son who is 15 months really loves being able to watch all his sesame street friends in a movie
ok this series is n't exactly like the final fantasy games but the elements are there for instance you have chocobo 's you have cactuar 's you have the summoning of guardian forces which by the way look really cool you have character 's which have too much power for their own good and a journey this journey is that of ai and yu 's search for their parents where they are accompanied by lisa pacifist a woman who possesses the cool power of kigen arts during their journey they see and do many wonderous things in wonderland i wont say anymore i dont want to spoil too much of the plot i have this product rated as stars but actually i think there it should be stars i really enjoyed this series but i dock it points because the time length adv gives the series to be is inadequate they say it is total 625 minutes where actually each episode is 45 sec thus 22.75 min 25 568.75 minutes long total length of series anywho if you like final fantasy i suggest watch this series
i rented terror train 1980 with a friend of mine about ten years ago and i remember after we watched it we were both like is that it '' not recalling what our criticisms of the film were at the time but i decided to give it another chance and you know what i liked it i really did i 'll grant you it 's not an outstanding feature but the effort is there resulting in an overall solid film directed by roger spottiswoode the pursuit of cooper turner hooch tomorrow never dies the movie stars jamie lee curtis the fog trading places a fish called wanda who a couple years earlier had appeared in a little horror feature you may have heard of called halloween 1978 also appearing is ben johnson hang 'em high red dawn hart bochner breaking away supergirl die hard derek mckinnon breaking all the rules sandee currie terminal choice timothy webber the hotel new hampshire and david copperfield who was at one time engaged to supermodel claudia schiffer but called it off as their relationship interfered with his work earning himself a place in the the f ' hall of fame as the movie opens it 's new year 's eve and the boys at the sigma phi omega house are having a party after a prank directed at one of the spaz fraternity pledges goes horribly wrong we fast forward three years and see another new year 's eve bash in the offing this time a costume affair taking place on an excursion train hosted by doc bochner and mo webber two of the fraternity brothers responsible for the prank that occurred three years ago also in attendance is alana curtis mo 's girlfriend who was also involved in the prank but not to the extent to being fully aware of what exactly doc and mo had planned resulting in some bad blood between her and doc who was essentially the ringleader and a real to boot anyway turns out the nerdlinger who was the victim of the gag is now a dangerous homicidal psychopath has decided this a good opportunity to exact his revenge by sneaking on board the train and murdering all those who wrong him back in the day actually it was a pretty good move because not only is most everyone disguised in costumes but they 're also stoned drunk and easy pickings also the trip is an all night deal with no place to stop so once the fun begins it wo n't end until it ends eventually those on board learn there 's a killer among them after the corpses start piling up but he could be disguised as anyone so who 's to be trusted oh yeah a magician played by david copperfield is also on board for the purpose of entertaining the rubes performing his illusions never call them tricks as that really ticks him off like i said i liked this canadian produced movie at least the time around i 'm not sure what changed other than the fact i 'm older but i think i have a bit more appreciation for the effort put into developing the characters within the film i believe this helped especially in terms of jamie lee curtis ' character as we saw she had real empathy for the kid who got tricked not so long ago apparently she tried to visit him after he ended up in the hospital along with strong disliking for the person whom she saw responsible for the prank that being doc a self centered manipulative type mostly for his cruelty but also because of the way he used her in his scheme the result of all this was an effort to make us feel for curtis ' character in that maybe she did n't deserve the same fate as the rest and it work for me at least the movie does fall within the ' realm but gore hounds will most likely be disappointed as there 's actually very little bloodletting violence spottiswoode in his directorial debut instead seems to be focusing on the suspenseful build up rather than on the visceral material normally present within the genre i thought there was some very decent scares throughout the film i did n't jump out of my seat or anything but the movie did keep my attention the goofy bits for me was how well the killer was able to keep his identity hidden even after those on the train realized who was the one responsible for the killings the story does throw around a red herring or two but at one point before his identity on the train is revealed you should be able to discern which passenger he is there was a definite sense of claustrophobia as most of the film takes place on train that has only three or four cars but then this also made the difficulty for those trying to find the killer seem all that much more well dumb one element that did n't really help was the amount of time spent watching david copperfield perform his magic his character who seemed quite smarmy to me did figure into the plot but it just felt like his lengthy performances were included to help pad out a decent running time i do n't mind magic but i would have preferred there not to have been as much as there was since this was supposed to be a horror film it was kind of funny though given how seriously he takes his craft to see him stuck on an excursion train having to impress a bunch of drunken college kids i did like the bit after the main conductor played ben johnson discovered the first body and attributes the death as being caused by kid messed up on dope ' as far as curtis her presence here did help a lot and probably resulted in quite a few seats being filled at the time of the movie 's release given her prominence of queen ' in the late she had all of three films out in 1980 this one along with the fog and prom night overall i found this to be a fairly engaging film one that rises slightly above that of your slasher feature the picture quality presented in anamorphic widescreen looks decent enough and the audio available in both dolby digital mono and stereo comes across well there 's really not much in the way of extras other than a theatrical trailer for the film and subtitles available in both english and spanish
up until last years match point crimes and misdemeanors was considered woody allen 's last great film i 've only seen 3 woody allen films not counting match point that came out after c m and before mp but i 'd have to agree crimes misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with allen 's greatest work films like the purple rose of cairo and annie hall it 's a perfect blend of drama and comedy in fact match point was kind of a retread of this film the drama without the comedy this movie stars martin landau 'ed wood ' as judah rosenthal an i do n't remember the term for one who 's been having an affair with a woman named dolores anjelica huston 'buffalo 66 ' problem is he 's tried to break it off but dolores is n't having it she 's instead threatened to expose his infidelity to his wife he 's barely intercepted the letters he looks to a patient a rabbi sam waterston 'the killing fields ' for help but it 's not working when he turns to his mobster brother jack jerry orbach 'law order ' for help jack suggests murder judah reluctantly gives in meanwhile a filmmaker named cliff stern allen is tapped by his lester alan alda 'mahattan murder mystery ' to make a documentary special on him cliff hates lester but is n't getting work anywhere else while working on it cliff meets halley reed mia farrow 'rosemary 's baby ' whom he falls for despite being married in typical woody allen style the film is fueled mostly by conversations between the main characters i liked his ploy of showing clips of old movies as a character was watching them that kind of went over what was occurring in his own movie the movie is separated into comedy and drama kind of like allen 's melinda and melinda '' the drama part is the judah plot the comedy is the cliff plot although both of them drift into the other category occasionally they both finally come together at the end the movie simultaneously reminded me of match point and manhattan the former for obvious reasons the latter because the endings are similar in what happens to allen 's character anyway the acting is great of course as is the dialogue as always there 's a lot of great i have n't been inside a woman since i visited the statue of liberty '' and some physical bits of humor as well if you 're a fan of woody allen you 'll definitely love it grade
this is such a fun movie to watch it is so goofy and ridicualous and you never get tired of watching it encino man and pauly shore is one of the reasons why the early ruled there are so many cool scenes in this like when stoney takes link to and they cruise the aisles looking for some grindeage to munch on and when they go to the mountian and ride the viper in reverse and the drivers ed scene when link thinks it is rad mobile and he puts it up on two wheels and they end up at the bar with all the mexicans you see that girl muchacho dont look at her ! '' the prom scene was cool to it had infectious grooves in it they are a real band but that song was made for the movie the singer and bass player are in suicidal tendencies and the bass player plays for metallica now but anyways yeah this movie is totally radical daves room is really cool to i wish my room was that rad the school looks cool too i wish my high school was like that i notice that whenever i watch something like this that was filmed in the early everything seemed real bright and cheerful am i crazy or has anyone else noticed this pauly shores punch lines and phrases never get old they age like a fine wine
i 've also reviewed the first two volumes but i honestly believe that volume three is the best i plan on getting them all and have the entire series for the first time in my life but if i had to pick a single best volume it would be this one from russia with love has the most solid cold war story of all the films and everyone is firing on all pistons connery is bond in this one making the character his own and robert shaw and lotte lenya as the villians are among the best on her majesty 's secret service is george lazenby 's only film and it remains a controversial entry in the series myself i loved it diana rigg is awesome the photography and editing are great and the story feels like it has more meat on its bones than any other film these first two films probably come closest to the ian fleming novels live and let die is moore 's first appearance as bond it has a hit paul mccartney wings song and a jane seymour along with a very charismatic villian in yaphet kotto the boat chase is still thrilling and sheriff pepper is still hilarious goldeneye is brosnan 's first appearance as bond and remains his best film wonderful use of russian locales particularly the graveyard '' of communist statues and the deadliest bond girl since pussy galore for your eyes only was an attempt to get back to better stories after the overblown epics of the seventies so as far as i 'm concerned there is n't a bad one in the lot like i said i plan on getting them all but this one looks like the best enjoy
quality was as good or better as i could expect from vhs tapes from the 70 's but loved the dvds i did notice minor 10 second syncing problems with disk 1
the product produced a clear picture good sound it was like being back in 1975 and experiencing that world series for the first time i enjoyed every minute of the games and interviews
if you are a dale jr fan this dvd is for you ! ! i 'm a hardcore fan and i loved shows the other side of dale off the track him with his buddies and just hangin lets you into his life which it pretty neat considering not many other drivers have done the hidden footage you even get to see his cat bud which adorable ! ! ! he shows off his new home and the shop
i knew that i wanted this movie but i had forgotten much of the plot it is a pleasure to view this one and recall that movies could be humorous without being decadent that adventure could be portrayed without endless special effects or digital animation or dissonant music '' and that the more leisurely pace was relaxing SMILE suffice to say that both my wife and i found it very enjoyable ! the extra clips were fascinating background on making of the movie one should not miss reviewing them the effort spent on the aircraft alone added a considerable touch of reality
stagecoach '' is significant along with destry rides again '' for redefining the western for adult '' audiences director john ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences for sure the film does contain a number of western archetypes the gambler the prostitute with a heart of gold etc but they transcend the stereotypes stagecoach '' is also significant as the film that broke john wayne to mainstream audiences wayne 's entrance as the ringo kid is the stuff of legends there is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated claire trevor as the social pariah dallas and thomas mitchell as doc boone for which he won an oscar the film 's status as being historically significant is not debatable as first class entertainment it is timeless
what do you get when you have rock the devil 's son and adam sandler playing the devil 's son you get little is the strangest movie adam sandler has possibly ever played in you have two of the devil 's sons who want to be the devil themselves and you have nicky the nice as can be devil does n't think any of his children are good enough to take his place yet until he tells them nicky could care less but his two brothers are and leaving it impossible for souls to enter or except for must leave his do gooder life and head to earth and save his father and all the humans in a left hell he now has only himself and a little dog companion beefy nicky has to learn to live a humans life and capture his two twisted brothers in a mystical those two and the fact that he ca n't release the evil '' nicky finds himself dazed and movie had some really cool side characters like two music is awsome with some good old and the comedy is actually say the jokes are kinda lame in this film i could n't find a reason to critique this movie extras are great featuring an in depth look at metal bands and rock in general a must rent
this is a fun art house '' movie fun because the script is tight and the acting top notch and you know from the start you are in the hands of a good director just the kind of thing you want from a night at an art house not a message movie like many such films but instead film making and three cheers for that campbell scott plays the smooth player who tutors his nephew nick jesse eisenberg on how to get laid the action takes place mostly in one night of bar and party hopping this script is so good that any bar lizard could learn from the lines and strategy used by scott 's character scott 's character is an accomplished and dedicated player who never sees the wrong in his ways and that is the delicious and honest part of the film one review talked about the player venting his anger at women but my take was that he stayed in control the entire movie venting naturally and within limits when he was thrown over by his like him or hate him the player is a pro from beginning to end the viewer has to decide whether he likes or dislikes women in the final analysis what matters is how well campbell scott 's character plays the game and he is a rodger dodger in an age of politically correct repression how refreshing ! five stars out of five
these were the first two with captain kirk i have to admitt that i own all 40 volumes yet i still may get the box sets each episode runs for 50 minutes longer than a 45 minute episode of the next generation but shorter than the unaired 63 minute pilot the cage
read between the lines stephane is nuts about her and totally paralyzed this reminds me of remains of the day everything is inside screaming to get out but there we are tension city with nothing to do but yell at the screen do something ! ! ! kiss her ! !

that special team is gone those players have mostly moved on but we 'll always have 2004 '' great way to relive the fun the hope and the victories for every diehard fan
the postman always rings twice is the epitome of how sublime the film noir genre can be the story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome into murdering her much older husband based on the novel by james cain and boasting the stylish performances of lana turner and john garfield this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic over half a century later we are still singing it 's praises from lana turner 's memorable entrance as cora smith clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills the drifter frank chambers garfield is so completely infatuated that murder can be as easy as picking up a lipstick case cecil kellaway karl malden and hume cronyn the new dvd from warners includes a fantastic documentary about john garfield plus and trailers technical details aspect ratio fullscreen disc snapper case audio english mono french mono german mono spanish mono subtitles english french german spanish portugese dutch danish icelandic croatian slovenian hungarian swedish czech greek polish romanian arabic english hearing impaired german hearing impaired
you ca n't wipe murder off our hands well perhaps you can especially if you 're like the two main protagonists in the postman always rings twice an absolutely marvelous movie of dark despair and foggy murky paranoia based on the novel by james cain the movie is all about the terrible consequences that can result from unchecked desire and obsession the sexy john garfield stars as frank chambers a tough enigmatic drifter from san francisco who arrives in the small california town of twin oaks frank 's a pretty rough and tumble sort of guy he 's a little lazy and a bit of a con artist but he 's decent enough and soon he gets offered a job in a diner run by nick smith cecil kellaway nick is very eager to employ frank but frank initially hesitates that is until he meets nick 's much younger wife cora smith a gorgeous lana turner cora is a blonde bombshell a real knockout first appearing in front of frank in skimpy shorts she 's even photographed from the legs up cora is a teasingly sexy femme fatale rolling her lipstick towards him in a hesitant dance of seduction perhaps a promise of what is to come the sexual attraction is almost immediate and as the tension steadily builds they begin a clandestine affair taking moonlit swims together while the affable nick remains totally unsuspecting of what 's going on soon cora confesses to frank that she does n't love her husband and she that married nick to give her a sense of security desperately in love the two decide to run away together by hitching but cora decides she does n't want to start life again with nothing and returns to the diner by this time frank ca n't get cora out of his head and with both of them feeling ever more trapped they decide to arrange an accident for her unsuspecting husband but their plan does n't quite work the situation becomes even worse when the local da leon ames catches onto them and their evil schemes the plot takes many twists and turns as cora and frank try to outmaneuver the law nick and also a pair of unscrupulous lawyers who are intent to see the sultry couple and sell out on each other despite the imposition of strict censorship laws the postman always rings twice bubbles over with passion even though much of the sensuality is suggested and because the censors would n't allow any sex or violence the filmmakers had to imply what was going on so the film projects an undercurrent of barely disguised passions sexuality and murder the censorship restrictions also make the performances of garfield and turner that much stronger relying on sharp dialogue and facial expressions the actors manage to weave a gorgeous sensual dance together both lighting up the screen and creating two of the most smolderingly complex characters ever seen in film the postman always rings twice is a classical noir tale of love that just goes disastrously wrong lust deceit lies and betrayal inevitably result because the two lovers just ca n't let go of each other and are trapped by their desires cora is dreadfully insecure and wants something in life that has always eluded her and frank is too caught up in his feelings for cora to see reason he 's just too to see how warped his judgment has become the postman always rings twice was remade in 1981 with jessica lange and jack nicholson in the lead roles i 've never seen it but hearsay suggests that although it is much steamier minus the restrictive censorship laws this version is still far superior even after all these years with its edgy character development it 's stylish photography and with turner and garfield as the leads it is indeed a terrific film and remains a verifiable masterpiece of hollywood film noir mike leonard july 05
i was reluctant to watch almost famous '' because i figured it would be chock full of hype but for some reason i decided to finally sit down and watch this story and i 'm glad i did i thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music music journalism fandom and groupies most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized and i appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective i especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully '' they do n't even know what it is to be a fan you know to truly love some silly little piece of music or some band so much that it hurts '' although i am not and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination i am an avid music aficionado i thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of fandom perfectly i liked the way cameron crowe humanized the groupies sure some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars and they do have feelings just like anyone else and i thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of penny lane '' i can remember when back in the groupies were little celebrities '' themselves so sersonally i do n't think that people should label them as tramps or judge them too harshly besides who knows maybe someone you know or may be related to may have a sweet little secret '' they 've been keeping along these years it was the after all some of those rockers got around and some apparently ordinary girls did too fact some of those gals just did what many of us wished we could do and they were for the most part honest about it at any rate the music used in the movie is just awesome ! it sure was fun to hear go all the way '' by the raspberries as well as tiny dancer '' by elton john how could you not sing along to that classic now that i 've been reading the reviews about the bootleg '' director 's cut i 'm going to have to watch that one too
best men surprised me very much i was n't expecting such a delightful if a little bit depressing movie directed by tamra davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor this movie is one of those you smile most of the time and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot luke wilson plays jesse a convict getting out of prison after a theft and who is getting married to his sweetheart hope drew barrymore along for the ride are his best friends dean cain as a former green beret who is gay mitchell whitfield as the lawyer saul who was wilson 's lawyer andy dick as the nerdy teddy who is in a bad marriage and sean patrick flannery who plays billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks billy does n't tell his buddies that he 's planning on robbing a bank before the wedding but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff fred ward who also happens to be billy 's father ! soon the inevitably nasty fbi comes in headed by the sadistic and cold agent played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable raymond barry dead man walking the chamber the movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale this dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest brad dourif gives one of his best performances since cuckoo 's nest '' as the mentally challenged vietnam vet fred ward dean cain sean patrick flannery and mitchell whitfield are also excellent it 's the best work i 've seen cain do the movie entertained me immensely and i would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy ! or is it a comic drama cheers
what happens when you title a movie mind the gap '' and lead the credits with alan king few people under seventy become interested but this is a great movie about life relationships and the gap '' jill souble is darn cute and the overall acting good to great king did his usual pro job too
just as i remember it when it first came out in the eightys good movie but got little recognition my wife who is 10 years younger than i had never heard of it but was impressed
no he does n't angel heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective harry angel and lou cyphere obviously the devil well not obvious to me at first ha ! the only bad part about this movie is the fuss people made over it the voodoo dance scenes were apparently fairly in keeping with tradition voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a devil '' character since there is no devil figure in voodoo however the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices it just happens to be how the devil got involved with johnney the missing crooner mickey rourke is stellar in this is enchanting deniro is flawless worth owning !
this was much much better than i expected it to be a real tear jerker if i was to let myself cry this movie would 've been it not the joy luck club '' andy garcia surely deserved an oscar nomination he was simply great i was not a big fan of his but here he clearly impressed me of course he was also terrific in the godfather part 3 '' meg ryan was effective but still a little too cutsey with the same mannerisms she uses in all her films but the two daughters were outstanding especially the older one played by tina majorino who appears to be about 7 or 8. also the look of the film set in san francisco is good especially the interiors of their house garcia really seems to care about ryan this movie is about love and how it does n't always carry the day with alcoholics i also liked the fact that this movie picks up in the middle of things they 've been married and had a kid you do n't learn til much later that he is not the older kid 's dad and we see her drink a lot they do n't start with how they fell in love or even attempt to explain why she 's an alcoholic smart
robert preston is the best professor hill this is definitely a classic keeper you want in your collectio
i 'm not going to try to get all the characters names right in yi yi and there are a lot of characters an extended family and various lovers and children taiwan is a modern impressive city a place rarely seen on american television or film i might be looking at manhattan rather than taipei the computer engineer 's family the wife with spiritual emptiness the teen daughter involved in her first serious sexual activity the grandmother on life support and the old son teased to exhaustion by little girls they live in a condominium over a raised superhighway then there 's the so superstitious that he marries his pregnant wife only on a chinese lucky day his old girlfriend shows up at the wedding to raise hell she returns at the babies chinese confirmation for more of the same a fight breaks out kicking little men and screechy women our engineer had walked away from a young love and while wife is with the monks he renews the relationship on a business trip to tokyo he is in love so is she but i ca n't tell you what happens without giving away this poignant part of the plot engineer 's daughter is having a rather unusual fling as well i 've left out a ton of information as this film was close to three hours long but watch the beautiful cinematography of edward yang and his brilliant pacing one thinks it is real life

when i am watching a 1984 movie i am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns some may call it predictible but myself i feel that the story flowed and made sense too many times have i seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere tom sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop gene simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his kiss type persona and plays the evil genius well i for one enjoyed this movie alot and unlike blade runner did n't find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line if you are looking for a believeable near future story pick this up
house of strangers is a cautionary film about the dangers of hatred being passed onto the next generation almost as if hatred were an old and unwelcome pair of shoes edward is gino moretti a banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral in his over the top performance as an italian who might have been vito coreleone had the don chosen to go straight robinson is a totally egomaniac who comes off more as a smug biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations it is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there it is only max richard conte who can see if only belatedly the vision of his father and even max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers max can not do this alone he requires the understanding first of maria debra paget then later helen susan hayward both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within gino moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons '' who do you think i built this bank for '' generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father the difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may in similar situations have emerged what goes around truly comes around and house of strangers continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche
before anything else i agree with those who say that keaton 's shorts are all good but i strongly disagree with those who say that they are better than his better features what usually happens with comedy is that people sit down before the screen and just say ok make me laugh keaton 's features are funny they are also and more important beautifully shot superbly acted and perfectly structured is something only the best can put all together there are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20 's keaton 's characters move in the real world with real things and that 's part of what makes them lasting and unique in your shelves keaton should n't share his place with the marx brothers but with orson welles who called the general the best movie ever made about the civil war and martin scorsese who said he watched over and over the final fight in battling butter by the way is not supposed to make you laugh but to surprise you with it 's realism now this are the complete contents of this dvd set aside from it you should check out the buster keaton collection which includes the cameraman spite marriage and free and easy and then you are done well you could also read the only book he wrote wonderful world of slapstick june update industrial strength keaton '' dvd just came out the set includes rare industrial films promotional films commercials tv appearances and outtakes the saphead 1920 includes the shorts one week 1920 and the high sign 1920 the three ages year 1923 including the goat 1921 and my wife 's relation 1922 our hospitality sherlock year the navigator year 1924 includes shorts the boat 1921 and the love nest 1923 go west year 1925 includes the scarecrow 1920 and the paleface 1921 seven chances year 1925 shorts neighbors 1920 the balloonatic 1923 battling butler year 1926 includes the haunted house 1921 and frozen north 1922 the general year 1926 shorts the playhouse 1921 and cops 1922 college year 1927 includes the electric house 1922 hard luck in this version the ending is missing but the complete version is found in the disc called keaton plus 1921 and the blacksmith 1922 steamboat bill year 1928 shorts convict 13 1920 and daydreams 1922 keaton plus year color home movies complete short hard luck two shorts from the 30 's commercials tv shows and appearances but best of all orson welles talking about keaton and the general
i love agressive ski videos that just kick and storm just rips no stupid bikini skiing or inner tube follies that i can remember just great skiing superbly shot with an awesome soundtrack my neighbors can hear me when i play this they think i have a screw loose
as a moderate skiier and a filmmaker myself this hits it home for me warren miller films are always shown locally and there 's hardly anything imaginable that could make me miss his new movie every year not being a heavy metal fan historically the music tends to be distracting alas this past year 's edition storm '' had just the right amount of pizazz and flare to make it my favorite yet there are moments nearly every year that i take home with me but storm was filled with the most amazing skiing some of the most unique locations and might add the most exhilarating editing i 've seen in quite a while ! kudos to you folks ! if you can appreciate the splendor of mountain island skiing that harldy anyone on earth has even seen let alone skiied then this dvd will certainly expediate your plans for skiing this coming season you might not go to south georgia island but there 's plenty of skiing nearby just roadtrip and split a cabin
this recommendation is for the uncut version of leon the professional a well crafted tightly edited excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll an action film that can be appreciated by those who generally do n't care for the genre the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it if you 're looking for something worthwhile to watch check this one out
luc besson 's the professional '' raises the stakes of besson 's playful theme by making the heroine a played by a then unknown natalie portman in the making of the professional '' besson says if i imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter i kill the guy in five seconds i kill him and i think it 's in me i 'm a beast ! '' on this part we ca n't forget that a part of us the genetic things inside are much much older than the ten commandments '' he certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie the blood running from mathilda 's nose or stansfield 's unforgettable everyone ! '' are just a couple of examples the music and the sound are good and are used in a masterly fashion you can hear fat man 's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when stansfield turns to look at mathilda 's father leon however does not work only on this primary level it also has an intelligent story it may seem to be almost a but do n't be fooled just like his character besson is serious this movie has a message without love we are dead even if we do n't see it only true love give meaning to our lives everything else reminds me a big yogurt warm and rancid '' as mathilda says in the original script which is available on the net under the name leon version 1. is this true in real life '' i do n't know but this movie can make you wonder then of course there 's the sensuality it 's hypocritical to deny it the camera interacts with mathilda in a mesmerizing fashion it 's not sick and it 's not degrading its art subtle and beautiful leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven it 's a movie that really should not be missed unless you are concerned with its amorality and do n't be leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact
love shelly long movies and bette midler too this is very enjoyable and funny was thrilled to have found a copy on amazon
i love this movie i ca n't go an entire day without watching it one time i was in the audience of leno whenever the camera panned over us i waved a copy of this pleasure in front of it while yelling about how funny this riot is ahh funny i remember the part where that one guy has to itch his balls just thinking about it makes me tingle with anticipation ! ! ! rent this movie or you will not see it buy it or forever hold your peace
royal wedding has been a favorite in the fred astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago astaire and jane powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film and astaire 's dance on the ceiling you 're all the world to me '' is classic the score by burton lane of finian 's rainbow fame and alan jay lerner future lyricist of my fair lady is unbeatable i need not comment further on the film 's merits it speaks for itself the film is now in the public domain and unfortunately nearly all vhs and dvd releases of such films are deplorable at best that is not so in this case the dvd i 'm commenting on here is from goodtimes dvd edition and i must say that the transfer looks pretty darn good for a pd film the picture is clear for the most part and although there are some minor color shifts and artifacts present they do not distract colors are fairly bold and are well defined the soundtrack is pretty clear and sounds fine there are no extras i have a very old copy of the vhs tape from home video and also a vhs dub i did off turner classic movies two years ago and honestly this dvd looks better than both it is about as good as we can expect for a pd film that has not been restored from original elements goodtimes is often better than most in their releases of pd films it could be a lot worse warner home video which controls release rights to the rest of the old mgm library has not given us a studio dvd release of royal wedding as yet and as far as i know none is in the works if you want royal wedding on dvd i absolutely recommend this goodtimes dvd release it is probably the best one you 'll find is at a very good price and comes in very nice packaging recommended
we all make mistakes in relationships things we wish we could relive do over this movie investigates the dynamics of one love relationship we go through two sceneros the first gives one the chance to live over a stituation correcting all the mistakes he thinks he has made this movie will keep you guessing you 'll experience the true deep feelings of love one couple have for one another these feelings end in the ultimate sacrifice for love the soundtrack is excellent i only wish we could buy it hewitt really is an underrated music artist her vocals shine and give depth to the movie this is a five star movie more than a tv movie watch it some rainy sunday afternoon it will make you believe in love again
i have watched this movie four times now and every time at the end of the movie i am crying like a baby it 's so sad ! ! ! but still so good
sexy funny and addictive i ca n't wait to buy season 3
i think this is the best of the monty python movies although i love them all this edition has lots of extra features like a documentary on the monty python guys made during the filming of this movie i learned lots of things i did n't know about them overall i could n't be happier
there 's only one word to describe this movie suhweeeeeeeet ! despite the dozens of imitators bloodsport was the first and best of its kind from the classic training sequence where young frank dux masters the martial arts and receives the katana he coveted as a boy to the motley group of tournament fighters with their goofy fighting techniques to the repeated chanting of ! ! ! '' on the pounding soundtrack there 's hardly a moment that wo n't have you pumped and calling for more the only parts that do n't quite work are the chase scenes and a young forest whittaker who seems not to have completely understood what sort of production he was appearing in but they do n't detract from the main attraction beatdowns and plenty of 'em this is a quintessential guys ' movie and if you have n't seen it you owe it to yourself to check it out
this 1988 gore film i ca n't call it anything else since it 's not a horror film in the classic sense features an ensemble of treat williams most notably from the substitute '' series of movies and comedian joe piscopo known for his years on saturday night live and comedy impersonating the likes of frank sinatra and david letterman among others the two play cops williams is roger and joe is his partner doug the back of the vhs gives a detailed description of the film plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie lindsay frost plays the stereotypical innocent '' woman caught up in everything that 's going on around her but the corpse of the situation deals with roger getting shot and coming back to life he must solve a case within so many hours or he 'll turn into ashes and as the hours progress naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally darren mcgavin plays the part of an evil doctor vincent price plays in a scene or two and he 's revealed to be the mastermind behind the resurrection room at the dante lab he plays a guy named loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead the movie is gory and and it succeeds in being a good parody of the lethal weapon 'buddy cop ' films even though it probably was n't intended to be the first time around but that 's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for films but those who like that kind of film will love this one it 's not so gore and so stomach turning it ca n't be seen several times like many of the texas chainsaw films are but dead heat '' is gory compared to other action films of this era starring charles bronson clint eastwood or mel gibson i give it 4 stars for the story cast and acting minus 1 star for the gore factor
i thought this dvd set was halarious ! i was hoping it would n't be the case where i saw it before and remembered it to be funnier than it really was but that was not the case it truely was one of the funniest seasons of a comedy show i 've ever seen ! i wonder if the cast has some sort of deal with sprite though because you see so many current and former cast members from this show in those commercials for sprite anyone care to comment on this my favorite skits are probably the movie satires and the one with michael jackson doing an infomercial is halarious ! i also like the rap video with ice cube in prison doing a song about acting etc just phenomenally halarious ! mc white said check it out ! !
i 'm a big fan of roseanne so it was no surprise to me that the halloween edition would n't be great tina
this show was excellent in every aspect i was captivated from the opening number and stayed glued to my tv until the closing credits it was so fun to see the entire osmond clan decked out in their holiday finest having such a wholesome and lighthearted good time i especially enjoyed seeing debbie donny 's wife sing a duet with donny and the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well there was even a guest appearance by the osmond grandparents i would recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned christmas special there is a mixture of traditional christmas songs some uptempo numbers and even some spiritual songs included a particularly poignant segment included little brother jimmy singing a song out in the snow i 'd never seen the two older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show one of the best christmas specials i 've seen in a long time it made me wish that i was part of their family after watching this i 'm more convinced than ever that i am the fat osmond who mother osmond abandoned in the hospital only to be adopted by some nice folks here in the pacific northwest
my daughter is 17 months old and next to rock and roll this is probably her least favorite of the sesame street movies and we have a lot of them if your child is like mine and likes the characters she sees a lot of on sesame street elmo ernie cookie grover etc they might not be as interested in this one although elmo is the cohost of the awards show with herry it is nice to see the monsters that do n't get a lot of play though herry monster is in about half of the songs it is worth it if you do n't have any videos with monster in the mirror also on rock and roll fuzzy and blue on sesame street anniversary or c is for cookie on several of the dvds
one of the best films i have seen captures the lack of humanity and humanity of this world simaltaneously humanises conflict has the ability to make you laugh and cry draws attention to the plight of children and humanises the children of the middle east i would recommend this film to everyone with a conscience as essential viewing having said that it did plunge me into depression so perhaps i should urge caution
i really enjoy this workout with the dvd i can do over the workout phase without having to rewind like with the vhs i originally wore out about 3 of her vhs workouts from rewinding and using again that makes it twice as much as you would just rewinding them once
standard elmo nothing special but still a good video
this movie was obviously weak in many ways one of them being the acto
the master '' at acting like a conceited prat ! a master '' at complicating a simple situation with snotty santimonious drivel while making fun of people who he deems are intellectually inferior to his royal self by twisting their ideas and words around to suit his assault on them he seems somewhat taken with alan price who was there to ' or maybe alan had nothing else better to do because he had just been fired from the animals price did get drunk and throw a glass out onto the street much to the annoyance of zimmerman he also opened a bottle of beer on a piano keyboard taking a chip out of the instrument showing total lack of respect for other people 's property i guess obnoxious prats stick together huh we see dylan take every opportunity to make fun of donovan and we also see dylan 's manager albert grossman trying to extort every last penny he can from british tv networks as he lies and plays them off one against the other in order to get himself and dylan a few extra pounds finally there are about 6 musical musical it is to laugh ! ! numbers from zimmy alone on stage with his guitar huffing'n'puffing into his harmonica and achieving little more musical sense out of his efforts than lou reed did on his metal machine music debacle yeah and do n't forget joan baez ! better still forget joan baez ! ! well worth a look
another van damme classic which is good whos the wimp just watch the movi
i need to preface this review with the comment that i am not a john wayne fan however the searchers '' is often said to be the duke 's best movie and it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and if anything his real talents were underused in his career still the searchers '' is a classic and deserves to be better known the anniversary edition is a must for any collector the restored print for the dvd is excellent just what you want to watch john ford 's gorgeous monument valley location shots the extras '' disk is also excellent there are three good documentaries all of which were made with thought and genuine concern a change from all those afterthought '' dvd extras one documentary features interviews with martin scorsese and another some great shots of the film production camp in monument valley in the early before it was on the tourist trail the documentaries would be of interest to serious film students and even amateur sociologists they illustrate the many serious social issues the searchers '' deals with and takes a serious and humane point of view on without preaching a lesson i suppose for today 's socially concerned '' film makers they really need to focus on the film making and the story first john ford did and the message is powerful and still relevant today
even though it tends to drag and the abuse gets a bit repetitive this is by far the best adaptation of the famous british navy story gable and laughton are perfect for their respective roles and the period is brilliantly displayed i 'm not a huge gable fan this and gone the wind are abt all i like him in
if you loved this movie try 50 first dates the surprising chemisty from drew and adam continues in that movie i love the humor and the clothes ! !
a solid series until the end even though this season the deaths are not important it centers more on the families it was sad to see the serise end but it is probably the series finale ever
what 's not to like about richard farnsworth he was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days an extremely likable old man '' hey few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old since he spent his younger days as a stuntman rather than as an actor so he was a very good choice to portray a likable thief bill miner the last of the stagecoach and train robbers the gentleman bandit '' i believe was his label this is a nice adventure with almost no bad language and the british columbia and washington state scenery is absolutely gorgeous it would look great on widescreen dvd what 's the holdup pun intended the only bad news of this tale is the usual filmmakers ' twisted message to root for a man who simply was a crook nothing else the film also especially to get the younger audience needs more action it will be too slow for them but i liked it if for no other reason that i can listen to farnsworth 's voice all night what a cool '' guy he was and it '' s always a pleasure to see him on screen
to anchor bay entertainment if you release the grey fox on dvd we 'll buy it ! this is truly a great film five stars is as good as it gets can you ask for more incentive than that
few days ago i watched the documentary z channel a magnificent obsession '' 2004 about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100 000 lucky subscribers in la in while enjoying the clips from many foreign and independent movies that were the best part of documentary i was able to recognize the movie that i saw many years ago in moscow and still remember well i could not only recall the title i remember that the movie was dutch very erotic in the raw brutal twisted yet beautiful and passionate way watching z channel '' i was happy to instantly recognize turks fruit '' 1973 aka turkish delight '' made by paul verhoeven in 1973. i checked with netflix the movie was available i bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it my memory served me well verhoeven 's early film is as naturalistic earthy brutal erotic humorous poetic poignant and captivating as i remember it based on the novel by jan wolker turkish delight '' stars young hot very sexy and i mean it very sexy rutger hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor eric and even younger monique van de van as his wife olga yet as sensual as eric was the light of his life the fire of his loins '' the film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful holland 's film that was nominated for an academy award for best foreign language film and was proclaimed by jan wolker a 75 masterpiece '' there are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as verhoeven of his dutch period especially verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work fiery temperament and aggressive joe ezsterhaus who worked with verhoeven on two films said about him the guy is like his movies brilliant mercurial very daring perverse a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions '' the turkish delight '' is all that and i love it but i can understand how its graphic sexuality more than one disgusting and revolting scenes but they had to be in the movie and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers be prepared turkish delight '' is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch
if there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people this would be it ! o'hara beautifully played by mia farrow does n't trust edwina the new beauty that 's come to town the two battle it out with edwina coming out the loser in the end or does she if i said any more i 'd be spoiling the story just watch this movie and enjoy things are never what they seem and i promise the ending will be worth staying for
he highlights the concepts very well for example the chapter on ball striking i never knew this concept in 2 years of playing golf must watch this dvd is made of several small chapters that have meaningful titles therefore on the second viewing u can jump to the chapter that requires repeat viewing
this movie was not only subject to some good acting by some great actors it was also a well written tale of of young woman who grew up too soon i feel like i know miss holiday a whole lot better now
ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks it seems to have all the usual bits knight on a mysterious quest lovable thief and a loving couple under a vicious curse even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film due largely to the outstanding cast rutger hauer the knight of course michelle pfeiffer the other half of the cursed couple matthew broderick knave with a heart of gold and leo kern aging hermit in on the terrible secret saying much more would mean saying too much but it has the fairy tale ending you 'd hope for and expect good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs one thing about this movie or maybe the dvd transfer truly annoys me however someone messed with the colors like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters and has n't learned how garish they can be to whoever did it please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time outside of that it 's a safe entertaining movie enjoy ! wiredweir
i first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend 's house and have loved isabeau and navarre ever since this movie has it all comedy drama and one amazing love story who 's heart did n't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise navarre 's devotion was utterly breathtaking a wonderful wonderful film
since i was a child i have patiently anticipated the battle of evil versus evil it was discussed in school yards and in the lunch room at slumber parties and later when i started working as a clerk in a grocery store it was a never ending who would win in the battle of freddy and jason in my youth children spoke of some underground video tape that contained a battle between the two monsters but i do n't think that it ever existed and if it did i have never laid my eyes on such a relic but finally the horror movie to end all was released onto the big screen and later on to dvd it was everything i hoped for there was blood brief nudity and really bad jokes that is the unholy trinity of horror the plot was n't horrible it was actually pretty good for a fright flick freddy has n't graced the silver screen since 1994 when wes craven presented new nightmare '' and he kept his integrity intact in my opinion jason vorhees on the other hand made the space film jason x '' as his last trip to the theatres and if you have n't seen it yet do n't bother you did n't miss much i liked how the movie gave a back story to jason 's life at crystal lake and it showed that krueger is conniving and manipulative with getting jason to go along with his plan to kill on elm street once again obviously jason is a big dumb animal and does not need much convincing the cinematography and directing were excellent i thought the music was done well and most importantly the film stayed true to the original story line the only thing that upset me was after all these years waiting for this battle to come i was wrong about who would be victorious
jason x as in friday the part 10 sheds light on a familiar though not too friendly face that of jason a miracle of science '' jason is to be transported from a facility to a research lab the transfer goes awry and he 's once again up to no good before being cryogenically suspended things become a bit complicated when in the year 2455 a spaceship arrives from earth ii ! and revives the masked lunatic the plot the setting the acting and the dialogues are all very good it 's just too bad the cutest girl gets whacked first in a nutshell jason x is a movie definitely worth watching as it will provide for an evening 's entertainment as long as you 're in that kind of a mood
after the worst friday '' movie of all time and thats saying a lot the series bounces back nine years later with this fun and nice change of pace for the series is just what the doctor been caught and chained by the goverment jason escapes killls everyone but one fine looking doctor who buck rogers '' like freezes jason and her self in the underground lab they are at flash foward to 2455 and earth now unliveable is visited by a group of students who free jason and the doctor from the lab before you can say ceh ceh ceh '' the best way i can spell the theme song jason is loose on the starship and cutting apart the crew like i said the novel setting and the use of some great make this one of the best of the series
this is a fantastic history of the blues ! unlike any of the other recent documentaries the stories are related in this show entirely by the artists there is no narrator and the feel of the show is very personal ! add to that some great music and you have a winner
john lennon and his wife yoko ono were guests on the dick cavett show three times in 1971. their first apearance was taped on saturday september 11 1971 and was john 's first interview after the beatles had disbanded the subsequent interviews were taped on friday september 24 1971 and thursday may 11 1972. viewers beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among dick cavett and his guests john appeared to be in his element happily chatting with the famous talk show host it was a good thing john rightfully defends yoko during this interview and makes it quite plain that she did not break up the beatles she has been wrongfully blamed for something that was bound to happen naturally after all the individuals who made up the beatles needed to move individually grow develop their own individual styles the group could not last forever cavett gives john and yoko equal time he listens to them attentively takes them seriously and at no time criticizes anybody or speculates about anybody it is very easy to forget the interviews are taking place before a studio audience as viewers are easily lulled into the flow of the conversation yoko is very animated during this first interview she smokes chats easily with her host about her undergraduate days at sarah lawrence and shows a film she made john and cavett are actually funny sharing some humorous observations about clothing and coiffure be sure to get this dvd collection it is funny interesting serious thought provoking and memorable this is something for everybody and not just beatle fans yokophiles and lennonophiles the bonus dvd will certainly bring many smiles to many faces
boy did this movie suck at the beginning ! and boy did it just get better and better from there on in even the oriental humor which is usually so awful was actually funny at times the action sequences while a little too often fanciful were very impressive even innovative chow is a talented guy having seen this i 'm interested to see what his earlier work is like if you like martial comedy you 'll love this
certainly the best movie i 've ever seen kung fu hustle is loaded with effects and humor and stunning fight sequences to boot try and watch any regular martial arts movie afterward and all you can do is yawn even the great bruce lee is tired and in comparison to kung fu hustle the movie continues to top itself throughout with an escalation of fight scenes that peaks with the hero jumping higher than the clouds seeing buddha lightly stepping off a bird and plunging to earth to deliver a blow capable of knocking a hole in a building ! this aint just it 's with hilarious weirdness
i know what you 're thinking if you 're anything at all like me when this movie was in the movie theaters and the previews were running rampantly i thought this looked like the stupidest piece of trash to ever grace the big screen but i 'll admit readily when i 'm wrong and here i absolutely was i 'm not saying little nicky is the world 's greatest film or even comedy but if you like adam sandler and silly comedies in general this is a movie that wo n't disappoint when you desperately need something mindless to turn your brain into mush after a horrendous week or even day at work a movie that opens with jon lovitz acting like a big horny bird in a tree certainly promises to be very entertaining and it is and we 're taken straight to hell with harvey keitel playing the devil himself very nicely a brief encounter with dan marino and the late rodney dangerfield to name a few we 're also treated to the heavens above with reese witherspoon and the guy who played adam sandler 's golf mentor in happy gilmore this movie has everything it takes to be insanely silly and entertaining and you 'll love what happens to hitler in this do n't take it too seriously if you do you miss the entire point of little nicky if this is your kind of movie add it to your collection you 'll watch it many many many times again enjoy
it is the best movie i have ever seen it was so funny adam sandler is the best actor in the world which makes it even better i saw it at my friend 's house i would watch it again but i do n't have it little kids under 6 should not see this movie you will defiantly like this movie that is why you should buy this movie jason m
i bought this season of survivor i never saw this season but it was very very good i 'm glad that jon lost and sandra won ! i was shocked when they let outcasts back into the game i 'm glad that lill came back but i was mad that burton came back ! 4 stars
annie hall '' is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time the film not only holds a place on the american film institute 's top 100 31 as well as the american film institute 's top 100 comedies 4 the film took home 4 academy awards including best picture and best director the film is also without a doubt one of the best ever made it really nails that awkwardness of romance i think few of us are like the neurotic woody allen and i do n't so much mean the way the characters act but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic woody allen plays alvy singer a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but ca n't really get a grip on love he 's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic which turns people off then his friend rob tony roberts introduces him to annie hall the wonderful diane keaton annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as alvy but the two click and begin a relationship that to say the least has it 's share of ups and downs now not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything but this film is also absolutely hilarious when i see a movie on afi 's top 100 comedies i tend to shy away from the films on that list not because they 're not good it 's just that they do n't really pick by what 's the funniest film ever example 'the 40 year old virgin ' was funnier than their number 1 pick some like it hot but anyway annie hall actually is very funny the dialogue is some the scenes have become classics allen sneezing on the cocaine in an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres it 's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is this is a great film a great a woody allen masterpiece grade a
not dissin the usa tour but i loved the europe tour dvd better after i saw this one this dvd was a nice eminem introduction to seeing his concert behind the scenes for me i can relate to his music madness and anger issues it did give me fan comfort while i did homework lessons and detroit love i passed it along for other college woman to i hope i get it is so amazing i can just order another one chinastar
unfairly overlooked in the early 90 's for rideing at the tale end of the last wave of 80 's slasher films 'popcorn 1991 ' is a damn good little slasher flick with a somewhat dry but exceptable endind some decent acting a ludicrous story some good dark atmosphere decent kills plenty of cheese a pretty creepy villain the parody of a slasher film being set in a movie theatre is excellent wes craven the makers of 'scream ' owe alot to this little known gem for slurping up some inspiration
what more can you ask for lou monte doing luna luna luna it 's here pope is vincent patrick 's best written work and his screenplay works with rourke and roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles the inside buzz is michael cimino sat in the directors chair but evidence to the contrary is offered the film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors instead pope is a raucous and likeable tale of nyc bottom feeders whose only place in trump tower would be behind a broom geraldine page gives an oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her best actress win for trip to bountiful she 's more enjoyable here
man talk about your untypical not your average regular kung fu movie ! ! steven chow blew the audiences away with this super those who have'nt seen it yet it 's a treat you simply can not dvd for anyone to add to their collection of favorites
i would n't write yet another review of war and peace if i did n't have something new to say about it namely war and peace and war by peter turchin near the end of turchin 's book about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires he quotes extensively from the parts of tolstoy 's war and peace tolstoy with his ratio analysis of various napoleon grand arme metrics to russian army metrics was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time pick up turchin 's deep book and afterwards read war and peace paying particular attention to turchin 's and tolstoy 's ideas you will never see historical dynamics the same again sincerely alex alaniz ps read the book the movie is n't so good and please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book beyond future shock about the perils and promise of advanced technology in a world still roiled with middle age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients
this cartoon gives me the entire memories when i use to watch them as a little dvd may not have the great special features but if you ever see this sucker available in a store do n't think about it just buy it
i 've been a christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of rutherford 's handling of the character i loved joan hickson 's portrayal of miss marple and never thought anyone else could be '' miss marple for me therefore i expected to be disappointed with these new releases i am not disappointed i love this new version ! after i cautiously viewed the first episode i came to fully appreciate geraldine mcewan in the role she is subtle confident and highly adroit and i find her refreshing and wonderful the stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing some reviewers complained that the scripts do n't stick to the originals but this is not an issue for me here christie 's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they are n't always done the same way any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times i think it 's fun to be surprised by my old favorites ! hooray for geraldine mcewan ! i hope to see many more miss marple stories with her in the title role
released during the just say no '' this film is a cautionary tale of drug abuse lenny is a guy just trying to stake his claim in the world to make a little money he soon impresses a big wheel who moves lenny and his wife to california where they are at first overwhelmed by the opulence but then become willing participants in it lenny continues to buy buy buy until it all crashes down when the money stops rolling in he is introduced to cocaine and the story then takes a dramatic turn as we watch lenny lose it all james woods is fabulous as lenny i 've seen this movie many times and now that i 'm writing about it i think it 's time to pop this one into the vcr for another viewing
quite a bit of what i see on the few tv channels i let my kids watch depicts either behavior or is so vacuous i can not stand it this series has a plot good writing and good production values it has the added benefit that i can also stand to watch it i am hoping the second season maintains the quality of the first
i 'm the biggest wuthering heights '' fan i know ask anyone who knows me and they 'll tell you i borderline annoying with the subject having money left over from my birthday i decided hey why not buy yet another wuthering heights dvd '' i was a little skeptical about how it would be seeing as all the adaptations i 've seen thus far have n't really taken the whole story into account of course to do so would be a hard task for a movie the story is complex and not a very sort of plot i was disappointed in the 1992 version with juliette binoche and ralph fiennes although it 's a good enough movie as long as it did n't have emily bronte 's wuthering heights as the title other versions were all right and although the 1939 version did n't showcase the second generation of the story i found it better than needless to say when i popped in the dvd i was hooked by the first five minutes sure the movie is n't exactly like the story i want you to show me a movie that is and as i said this story is complex for the movies some of the things that are are the fact that once again as in many of the movie adaptations nelly is old from the start also heathcliff and cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place such as when they visit the lintons most wuthering heights '' fanatics know that heathcliff and cathy never consemate their relationship however there 's many a kiss in the movie there are some other details of the movie that are different than the story but i a crazy wuthering heights '' and bronte admirer give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan
it would n't surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie it 's rife for debate gary cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end we know he 'd never do it again sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because i have to '' and all that but only a fool would think that a place like hadleyville deserves protection can you imagine clint eastwood in cooper 's shoes at least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with hadleyville and its cowardly citizens but has everything to do with cooper and his code of honor is n't this the same gary cooper who played frederic henry in a farewell to arms based on hemingway 's novel a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and courage under fire '' a character who says in the novel that abstract words such as glory honor and courage were obscene '' how could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day never mind looking his wife in the eye again if he 'd skadaddled this existential hero had a choice to make a one and for him it meant only one thing it 's that kind of movie meaty and meaningful the experiment is interesting in these days of tv shows like 24 '' and the witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering too and let 's not forget the music either but basically it comes down to cooper reaching out and finding nobody there and then doing what he has to do anyway it 's a timeless idea and the movie is a classic
i am a very avid star trek '' fan and find the dvd 's very worthwhile and interesting my star trek interests go back to the original series with william shatner leonard nimoy james doohan et al
i have to agree completely with the reviewer '' i read his review of play it again sam '' the scene where woody allen tries to be cool and composed when introduced to a lady and he instead of sounding anything like english only growls i recently found out about this movie because all i could think was of that scene that i did n't know where it came from i have to repeat that '' is right on the money that was the best comical scene ever
based on the hyper known last farewell of bogart and bergman in casablanca will emerge a fabulous extraordinary and funny script that will allow allen to lean on bogart spirit to guide him about his personal hesitations and tribulations around the bride of his best friend surrealist and inventive tantalizing and evocative that counts with an excellent cast do not miss it for any reason
joseph campbell would be proud of this coming of age hero story haru chris farley is a ninja school dropout he still maintains a positive attitude he gets an opportunity to help a sally a lady in distress nicollette sheridan his mission will eventually take him to the hills of beverly sensei soon tek oh is like a father to him sensei realizing he can not sway haru from his mission sends another ninja gobei robin shou who is haru 's spiritual brother to quietly help on this mission haru gobei and sensei learn more about themselves
excellent delivered in a very timely manor new condition i could not have been more pleased
i loved the the fact the whole family can watch it
the age of the hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the century then with the change of modern society in the 1960 's the western genre lost its allure and hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare thanks to ted turner and his love for american western film making the long lost western has been reborn in a big way tom selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of john wayne selleck is more than adequate for the part big in body and big in acting skill he takes the part of paul cable and turns his character into someone we can believe like and respect cable comes back from the civil war months before its official end he is tired of war and killing and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of arizona in trying to escape his wartime experiences cable runs into more trouble at home he finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning confederate soldier cable must not only fight to regain his farm but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage the story by elmore leonard is a solid one and very believable there are no dull or boring scenes the picture grabs you and holds you throughout selleck is terrific as paul cable fighting for his family his woman and his life selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of john wayne he is every man 's western hero selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease he is supported with a fine ensemble cast including suzy amis as his embittered gritty wife and haley joel osment of the sixth sense '' fame in a minor role as selleck 's son amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt amis ' portrayal as cable breaks the mould we see her with dirt and dust on her face with sweat dripping in lines across her face and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands or for that matter a rifle i personally welcome this portrayal of western women as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her petticoats david and keith cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm harry carey plays a small role as selleck 's as a collector of fine western films i intend to keep last stand at saber river '' as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great hollywood westerns it 's not an epic but it is fine and will please those craving for a fine western drama i recommend it james konedog '' koeni
this movie i consider to be akin to 'vertigo ' by alfred hitchcock the pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of action pulling the story along it also mimics 'rear window ' in that the main character witnesses a murder in this case though he was set up to be the witness depalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire he slams the porn industry in some very funny ways you will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes what i liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end i do n't want to give away too much here but a clever use of 'hollywood hijinks ' and the line 'do n't believe everything you see ' fit with the story very well 'postcards from the edge ' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be in this film depalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be as in 'dressed to kill ' depalma relies on acting to carry the story and quite successfully too the scene begins when craig wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he 's been watching though a telescope the scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach i believe it 's about 20 minutes played out well with body language and facial expressions this scene could n't work any other way like 'vertigo ' this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat maybe too much detail not sure i found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to many movies attempt this slower approach or do it in a way that makes it work all in all definitely a must see keep in mind the action is a bit slow at times melanie griffith appears here and does a great job in her role as do the other actors filming camera angels and use of props all work well the plot is complex this is a must see for mystery fans
though cancelled for 2 years this is the best show on tv in my opinion even in reruns
we have all heard about placement ' especially in the james bond films did you know it goes all the way back to no and was very prominent in the scene where bond kicks and tosses quarrel and puss feller into a stack of corrugated cartons notice that those cartons are labeled stripe ' that 's right stripe ' beer from jamaica ! in this case placement ' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film in fact no is one of the best films of the series it is much closer to ian fleming 's prose than most of the other films thanks to sean connery 's performance richard maibaum 's scripting and terence young 's direction at the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here production designer ken adam 's sets attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional adorned by syd cain 's detailed art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in no the benchmark peter hunt 's intuitive and effective editing paced the film like no other at its time maurice binder 's brainchild opening barrel ' is an incredible piece of title design which is equaled only by the bond theme ' composed and by monty norman and john barry ted moore 's cinematography especially the shot of bikini clad ursula andress emerging from the sea is now a classic and also set a standard for future girls ' we are introduced to the organization known as in no what is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by joseph wiseman he is unlike future main villains of the series he is n't exactly what you may call a animal ' joseph wiseman 's eerie and surreptitious portrayal made no one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series in a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen blofeld in from russia with love and thunderball rounded out by the beloved m portrayed by bernard lee the lovely miss moneypenny played by lois maxwell john kitzmiller as quarrel and zena marshall as miss taro no ranks as one of the best
this movie was more than i expected i was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects and especially the robots you are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end i did not expect it to be who it was the reason why i rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from smith i was not prepared for it especially since the movie is not rated for language other than that i highly recommend this movie
kelly 's heroes '' is an odd yet quite enjoyable war movie this 1970 's comedic cinematic take on wwii mixes genres such as the suicide film the film and the army comedy in other words take a lot of the dirty dozen '' mix a bit of ocean 's 11 '' and add in some '' plus '' and you 'll have kelly 's heroes '' the film features a battered army infantry unit which has been on the front lines since landing at omaha beach all they have on there minds is a little r r that includes booze broads that is until pvt kelly clint eastwood interrogates with a bottle of brandy a captured german intelligence officer who tells him about a nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small french bank that is being vigorously guarded by three nazi 'tiger ' tanks i know in this day and age it might sound rather odd but this is one war movie that is not only suspenseful but is also a whole lot of fun ! is it an accurate portrayle of wwii probably not i doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the big one '' this 1970 release pretty much through its ' hilarious sharp script has more of a vietnam era mentality which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it 's attitudes about war unlike the john wayne style war films of the past these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes but they are just trying to make it through the war with their 's intact and maby make a little profit on the side the film features a large talented cast some of whom were already stars and others who later went on to become big names in both television and film this includes clint eastwood telly savalas donald sutherland don rickles caroll o'connor gavin macleod stuart margolin harry dean stanton and len lesser uncle leo from tv 's seinfeld '' how can you go wrong with a cast like that if your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs mixed in then i would highly recommend kelly 's heroes ''
its hard to imagine that a war film can leave you with a big smile at the conclusion but here is one that will ! with non stop action drama and comedy kellys heroes has it all with a top notch cast and soundtrack to boot the original script of a bank heist behind enemy lines during is a classic and is brilliantly executed at all levels even though the film is based on a fictional plot it still has an authentic feel and is rated an all time classic highly recommended
all monty python movies are a i think my generation has seen them all i hope the younger generation less than 40 watch at least one the humor is at many levels so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in this just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing like all good humor it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general as well as politics and religion without getting nasty

this dvd is the best one ive ever seen snoop put out the concert footage and sound isnt the greatest but this dvd is so much more that i thought i was getting dont get me wrong the concert parts are so dope to hear my fav snoop classics and i was left with one question how did they get clearance from suge to put out his death row classics but this dvd shines as a replayable classic you would be so so suprised at what is on this see most people are happy getting a concert dvd like the up and smoke where snoop performs in one city you watch it after fast forwarding through all the opening acts like westside connec and you dont have to watch it again for years this is quite a different approach i was literally hurting from laughing so hard because this dvd gives you the bishop don juan it gives you backstage it gives you the norml conference you cant even take it all in if you watched it once ! i say if you like snoop if you like weed if you like biatches and hiznoes you got a winner with the puff puff pass
most of this movie is terrible but who 's complaining the epically long begin the beguine '' is the climax of the movie it makes the whole mess worthwhile the last 11 minutes of this movie are great absolute perfection the sets the cinematography the costumes the orchestrations the extraordinary routine itself everything combines to make begin the beguine '' the most ravishing glamorous black white production number ever put on film it 's hollywood at its apogee the quintessence of silver screen glamor a few of the other numbers are fun the first do n't monkey with broadway '' is clever pleasant later on fred astaire 's lovely i 've got my eyes on you '' is also winning a charming routine that he dances to a delightful cheerful orchestration some other numbers are worth seeing as well but begin the beguine '' outshines everything else in this picture in between the numbers there 's a lot of dreary silliness afoot happily dvd technology makes it easy to skip over the dross go straight for the gold eleanor powell was a very odd actress she was rather pretty decidedly perky how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality she was also quite feminine why then does she speak out of the side of her mouth like a gangster she often sounds like a distaff edward robinson dat was swell johnny swell ! nyah ! '' but man oh man could she dance !
right after watching this my wife and i called our now 14 yo dancer in to see it she in turn had her dance buddies watch it the next time they were over the look of amazement on all of our faces as we watched some of the best there ever was worth the price of admission like the commercial says dvd player 200 dvd 15 watching your daughter work ten times harder on her
oh wow i ca n't complain much about this although some things i did n't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed this was still very effective on me it may 've been better as a game or not i do n't know there were several times where this made me so emotional i wanted to cry for the characters the silent and melancholy kaze the hilarious and deranged cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins even for the short time you know them they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching i know some people may not be satisfied with this but i was i recommend it
all time classic story no matter your economic circumstances with the right help anyone can succeed just do n't forget the people you left behind !
i had often heard about degrassi the next generation i went on to the show 's website often even though i did n't get the channel it shows on i knew as much about the show that everyone else did and i did n't even see the show so after a year or two of trying to figure out how to i could see the show i heard that they were making a dvd and i was so excited ! i ordered it on ebay a few months after it came out and it was fairly priced i watched all of it in a day and i was ecstatic this show is all about what it is really like being a teen nothing fake but not giving life lessons on everything like internet relationships the effects of using ecstasy presssure beer family rumors first dates and all sorts of things season one is especially perfect for prettens and early teenagers because it is based around a group of and graders of course through the seasons the characters face changes and more dramatic situations but somehow there is always a season for teens and preteens of every age to relate to and that 's what everybody likes about the show this dvd also includes auditions for most cast members which are fun to watch bloopers and deleted scenes which add more to the episode and a karaoke of the theme song which is also very fun with cast and characters biographies you can tell that the creators of the dvds put as much into them as possible and it pays off
ronald reagan might have gotten the nickname of the gipper '' from this 1940 of legendary notre dame football coach knute rockne but it was veteran character actor pat o'brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead james cagney had lobbied hard for the role but when the actor signed a petition supporting the republican and government in the spanish civil war notre dame refused to okay him for the part this was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in south bend and if you do know that the other one was rudy '' you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one knute rockne all american '' which was added to the national film registry in 1997 is a fairly standard evincing the almost documentary style that was standard at the time we see how the young rockne played by johnny sheffield boy in the johnny weissmuller tarzan movies learned to love football revolutionized the game with the forward pass and coached his alma mater to glory with the four horsemen and george gipp the result is a long series of episodes from rockne 's life that have varying degrees of appeal such as when he picks up the idea for his backfield shift from watching chorus girls dance and experiments with the idea using his wife and their dinner guests lots of footage of actual notre dame games are worked into the film although i have no way of knowing if any of it is of the actual games being portrayed i would be curious to know o'brien 's performance seems a tad wooden but if you have ever seen actual film clips of rockne you know he is in the ballpark a lot of the charm of this film comes from the ethos of the original rockne an american legend who was probably the first famous victim of an airplane crash the result is not great but certainly compelling plus we all learn the correct pronunciation of his name as being reagan 's supporting role is deservedly memorable that same year he would get to play third banana george armstrong custer to errol flynn and olivia dehavilland in the santa fe trail '' and would provide his best performance in king 's row '' before military service in world war ii effectively derailed his acting momentum and ultimately set his life on a different path final note while there is little doubt that rockne invented the forward pass there is debate over one aspect of this film in his first scene as george gipp reagan is sitting around doing nothing when rockne orders him to go in at halfback to play against the varsity and run the ball gipp asks how far '' and proceeds to run it back all the way after crossing the goal line he bounces the ball off the endzone instead of laying it down for the touchdown '' an argument has been made that this was the first spike in the history of football at least it is the first recorded '' spike did the current tradition of choreographed celebrations all stem from what ronald reagan did in this 1940 film you decide if that is yet another part of the reagan legacy that is being reconsidered this week
if no adjective appropriately suit this vivid collection of films from the and one reviewer came close in his chosen nomenclature this indeed is indespensable '' ! for anyone interested in or in some way connected to film and film studies this box set is a true gem as well as an overwhelming visceral experience one dare even call it edenic '' packed with cinematic treats ranging from early classics as joris ivens ' regen '' through film historical curiosities as marcel duchamps ' cinema '' and richter 's rhytmus 21 '' to absolute rarities such as kirsanoff 's '' this impressive collection of short experimental films guides you through all main genres of the and from impressionist masterpieces '' la glace a trois faces '' epstein through dadaist duchamps french and german film symphonie diagonale '' eggeling rhytmus 21 '' richter futuristic statements mecanique '' leger dazzling city symphonies regen '' to such seminal early sound experiments as romance sentimentale '' eisenstein alexandrov and le tempestaire '' epstein while some films may indeed only be labled curiosities '' others are sheer strokes of genius my personal favorites being kirsanoff 's rare impressionistic gem '' with its impressive in every sense of the word use of constant concealing the first person and jean epsteins masterpiece le tempestaire '' whose use of musique or sound '' as it were and vividly picturesque imagery make for a unique cinematic experience as visceral as it is beautiful to behold if only for its lack of a few early classics notably clair 's entr'act '' 1924 and luis 's un chien andalou '' 1929 and d'or '' 1930 this combilation of early experimental films may not be labeled perfect '' however i am still to experience any other collection of its kind for anyone studying film whether by themselves or in university this box set may indeed only be ascribed the adjective indespensible '' as done also by a previous reviewer
a for all kate rusby fans this concert video is a pure winner showcasing rusby and her band at their best before an adoring appreciative english audience several things are worth pointing out first what a delight to see how friendly and she is and what a fine performer authoritative yet not stuffy or standoffish in any way she presents these old trad ballads in a way that makes them seem like the most immediate and compelling of contemporary art and of course the music is simply stunning the band plays sweet but keeps things simple it 's warm and modern without muddling down in crossover pretensions it 's just simply lovely lovely acoustic music finally there 's the experience of seeing rusby sing is it possible such a perfect sound is coming out of that lass before you guess so now i 'll have to redouble my efforts to see her when she plays live at a venue near me i know it 'll be a night to remember
i 'm a big survivor fan and as such i love any of the dvd complete season packets of survivor it 's great because if you happened to miss one of the episodes for whatever reason you get to see the challenges and how and why the person got voted off the island i did not however give this 5 stars because i also own the survivor dvd pack so i know that they could have done more with the palau pack in the pack you get to see a lot more speacial features of things occured on the island but never made it into the broadcast some of these outakes give a lot of insite into camp life and the characters which is always fun but other than missing those features the survivor palau pack is well worth seeing

i have been an adult swim viewer since space ghost ctc 's early days the venture brothers is probably my favorite of them all the brak show was a riot also i am in my 40 's and so i can relate to all the jokes on the stuff i grew up on marvel dc johnny quest scooby doo etc the formula started with sgctc taking mundane kids 's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references many homosexual uber violence for violence 's sake profanity beeped out but you know what they are saying well you get my drift think excrement jokes it 's ted turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi american of good bad in cartoons and screwing it all to hell but despite the same formula over and over sgctc harvey birdman aal the brak show robot chicken aqua team hunger force sealab 2021 and probably some others i missed i still watch and laugh with the venture brothers being the best of them all one thing that i really laugh about is that the teens and gen x'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from they are just laughing at the situations and do n't get the parody i tried to tell a whose 25 years old about a robot chicken bit about hogan 's heroes and he never heard of that show ! i 'm glad the venture brothers has got a strong audience so thanks you young ignorant types for watching ! i 'm in baby boomer delight !
i love this movie great sequel great characters great gore a must for all fans of the saw '' movies

known to all this is the story of dorothy gale and her journey to the magical land of oz she meets a scarecrow who needs a brain a tin man who wants a heart and a cowardly lion who desperately needs courage the most popular film of all time seen by over a billion people it 's timelessness is proof enough of its value certainly flawed when scrutinized and written about for 56 years but still most beloved in 1998 rereleased on the big screen magic and admittedly the most important film of my life as a child i was obsessed with the film and only a little less now
the movie with the or guarantee ! crank your engines ! with a roar sputter and pop drivers wheel westward in wacky century autos for a new race ahead 20.000 miles a barroom brawl a sinking iceberg 2.357 pies in the face and incalculable laughts blake edwards turns a marvelous cast loose on a higway by some of the funniest screen gags ever jack lemmon and peter falk are nasty professor fate and his dim henchman max tony curtis is their nemsis the great leslie and nathalie wood is suffragatte reporter maggie dubois zestily scored by henry mancini and ravishing in a new digital transfer with revitalized digital audio from restored elements the great race is great fun ! as i mention super transfer and recommended highly !
lemon and curtis are a great team some like it hot '' and the great race '' in this movie we have great melodrama and the ageless story of boy meets girl natalie wood and she catches him the cast is enhanced by the superb acting of peter falk in one of his great comic roles the hapless maximillian always catching the short end of the stick by his perpetually boss the permanently crabby professor fate lemon curtis does what he does best looks dashing and debonoir in a role so familiar to him he could phone it in this dvd is a collector and one of my top ten favorites
waiting was a pleasant surprise it 's certainly filled with crude humor but it manages to be funny anyhow my first job was in a restaurant much like shenaniganz and perhaps that 's why i found the movie so worth watching the game the employees play is over the top but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on if you 're a rude anus of a customer do n't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks wo n't mess with your food they will it pays to be polite and tip well especially if you are a regular chi mcbride 's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great and i thought luis guzman did a great job as raddimus all in all based on personal experience the movie was n't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical golden corral or ryan 's steak house sure the characters are over the top but they are based on people just like some i 've known if you 're offended by frontal male and female nudity or crass sex jokes you wo n't want to see this movie
this film burns the screen with power sensitivity unbreakable bonds and emotional connections that will blow your mind jolie and burress shine in foxfire in a way that you 'll never forget every woman has been a girl and even if they store their feelings deep inside they have to wish they had spent a few months like these girls i know i do but even guys have to relate to the realistic rebellious and connected spirit these girls reflect every character is i wish i could change the ending of the movie but that ending is what keeps things real this movie is definitely a treasure
foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world the inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the girl that brings the 4 others together legs played phenomenally by angelina jolie i must say this i really do n't care much for jolie and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her billy bob and their whole blood thing the top news story more recently her with brad pitt but i cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance if you are like me and do n't like her please do give her a chance in this film she 's astonishingly good and i kept having to remind myself it was angelina as a matter of fact the entire cast turns in memorable performances i think this is a great movie for women to watch but i do n't know if men will enjoy it quite as much i did see one male reviewer claiming he did n't find it to be just a chick flick but he might be the minority guy or gal if the story sounds intriguing to you and it really is then foxfire is definitely worth checking out i give it only 4 stars simply because the character of maddy wonderfully played by hedy burress has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with but that 's my only criticism at this price it 's a fabulous addition to your collection though believe it or not the low price right here on amazon has been beaten by it 's in the 5.50 bin this is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe definitely recommended
probably the best place to start for bergman initiates three decent films although i think through a glass '' is in a different class to the other two features moreover they all form a useful overview of the progression of bergman 's art from circa 1960 to circa from the religious torment of 1961 's winter light '' through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of through a glass '' to the explicit focus on familial relationships of the silence '' the latter reminiscent of bergman 's 60 's output in short although there is nothing to match the astounding persona '' 1966 the films do give a great indication as to bergman 's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in euroean art house cinema of the early in general dvd excellent criterion transfers the documentary disc a swedish film about the production of winter light '' is excellent as well worth watching alone for bergman 's casual conversations on his religious torment he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread

soldier of orange with commentary by director paul verhoeven is a for all history buffs wwii historians and lovers of war movies based on the life of erik haselhoff roelfzema it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of a small group of law students in leiden the netherlands verhoeven 's commentary is worth the price of the dvd as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray while asking some very thought provoking questions verhoeven and i are the same age and both of us lived in holland during the occupation his view of the conditions in holland and the responses of the dutch under occupation are very different i also think his references to das england spiel are inaccurate having said all that i still consider the dvd one of my most favorite productions including the film itself soldaat van oranje is my choice for best ever dutch film those interested in learning more about the real eric hazelhoff roelfzema should read soldaat van oranje omnibus '' which includes de verre tamboer the distant drummer '' and op jacht naar het leven in pursuit of life '' all by eric hazelhoff roelfzema
yet another amazing film from paul verhoeven with so much depth and weight i ca n't even tell you stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do jeroen krabbe gives an excellent performance as does rutger hauer in the leading role everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films so many great scenes alex and eric 's tango towards the end april fools day '' vengeance on a bicycle the beach scene and many many more see this as soon as possible it would make a terrific double feature with the young lions
this is a wonderful collection of horror pictures made by mgm and warner brothers during the thirties neither studio was noted for horror pictures but the ones they did make are unforgettable to fans of the genre as well as late night movie addicts following is a synopsis of the films contained in the collection the mask of fu manchu mgm 1932 boris karloff is wonderfully creepy as sax rohmer 's evil genius fu manchu it would not be the last time karloff played a chinese as he later starred as wong in monogram 's low budget detective series later in the decade the plot concerns a race between good guy lewis stone and fu manchu to find the tomb of ghengis khan if fu manchu gets there first he will possess the magical relics placed there which in turn will allow him to enslave the world look for a young myrna loy in a delightful turn as fu 's diabolical and daughter doctor x wb 1932 a good early effort by michael curtiz concerning the moon killer '' murders in which the victims are strangled cannibalized and surgically dissected under the light of the full moon reporter lee tracy traces the clues to a spooky seaside mansion where xavier lionel atwill and his colleagues are conducting strange experiments made in early technicolor the film is wonderfully atmospheric and the sets themselves will linger in your mind aside from the irritating lee tracy as reporter lee taylor the acting is crisp and to the point atwill in particular is eerie fay wray is good as xavier 's daughter i wo n't give any more of the plot away but just remember the phrase synthetic flash '' once heard it will linger in the mind always mark of the vampire mgm 1935 tod browning 's remake of his london after midnight '' with bela lugosi as the vampire count mora and lionel atwill as inspector newman in the original both roles were played by lon chaney the plot concerns the death of sir karell borotyn who appears to have been killed by vampire count mora fearing that the vampire 's next victim will be borotyn 's daughter irena elizabeth allan vampire expert professor zelen lionel barrymore is called i to protect her and shed some light on the look for carroll borland as the count 's daughter a role played by edna tichenor in the original mad love mgm 1935 one of the great plots in horror film history and one that has been repeated many times colin clive plays the brilliant concert pianist stephen orlac whose hands are crushed in a train accident his wife yvonne is a noted stage actress whose ardent admirer is gogol peter lorre although she rejected gogol previously she is forced to seek his help in restoring her husband 's hands gogol replaces orlac 's hands with those of executed knife thrower rollo and the fun begins clive is his usual tortured neurotic self and lorre is brilliant as the oily monomaniacal gogol pauline keal in her book on citizen kane stated that welles copied lorre 's look for the older kane the devil doll mgm 1936 tod browning 's last great film is about as respected parisian banker lionel barrymore who is framed for robbery and murder and sent to devil 's island years later he escapes in the company of a scientist who has discovered a way to shrink living things to their original size barrymore finds a new use for the scientist 's discovery as a means of revenge on those who had framed him the return of doctor x wb 1939 the famous humphrey bogart punishment picture ! after years of complaining about his gangster roles it was said that jack warner decided to teach bogie a lesson and put him in the role of a vampiric lab assistant who needs freshly drained blood in order to stay alive bogart is a hoot in white makeup and a grey streak through his hair wayne morris play the reporter who exposes bogie as the killer tough job considering the makeup look for olin howard jensen the drunk in them ! and the blob 's first victim as the undertaker this film has never before been released on either vhs or dvd so it is a welcome find for horror fans and bogart fans as well
in my opinion there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of martin short 's humor with the exception of clifford '' my then teen children and i spilt our sides laughing at short 's work when we first saw this film ! several times we laughed so hard at a scene we could n't go on until we replayed the scene several times over we were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter ! all three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored even if you are not a big fan of martin short you will enjoy clifford ''
i was so disappointed they cancelled this series i was hoping that the scifi channel would pick it up hope you science finction lovers got this one because it 's great
it is movie about the strength of friendship and how three men carry out a promise to a dying men will fight to the end for a dream of one characters drew strength from one tells about the hardships of the old unfortunate greed of men and how greed can selleck 's character showed the the ability to love a woman and his love of his other characters complimented each movie was well worth the will want more of the same
regarding the above title there was very little difference between the 2 versions on this edition of the dvd there seems little point in the censors deleting the scenes as they did in the usa and the uk as they do very little to the film 's context still it 's a very good horror film anyways with plenty of gore if that 's what you 're into and i 'd still give it a 9 out of 10
tcm iii was a good had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror lacked the essential characters would 've done better if they had brought chop top or drayton back to film is about two friends headed down to florida from texas when they come upon a pit of decayed already know it was leatherface and the two drive next day they come upon a gas station where a crazy yet funny gas station attendant named alfredo making his appearance here as well is viggo mortenson as tex a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods pursued by the evr vigialnt leatherface armed with his trusty gets the job done every in the texas chainsaw tradition they are captured and prepared for of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on leatherface with the help of an veteran they met along the 's an overall good movie and i loved it
my 2 and 3 year old boys really enjoyed this dvd this backyardigans dvd is their favorite so far they have the 2 others snow fort and it 's great to be a ghost also the music is lively but not loud and obnoxious like some kid 's videos it introduces kids to different styles of music and has great characters whose behaviors you do n't mind your children copying the backyardigans are one of my favorite shows for them to watch
love it love them all disagree about the pace of this one heart of the jungle is great even though it is slower and you have to own this one just to get the tea party show it is a must have even if it is just for polka palace which is great unto itself
i can not recall a time when i did not love this hilarious movie which is my favourite from the 1980 's by far the superb bette midler and lily tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in big business '' that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from hollywood 's golden age a total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely does n't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory the premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in big business '' it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble jupitor hollow to the height of new york 's business world the story begins in a flash back when wealthy new yorkers hunt and binky shelton are passing through rural backwater jupitor hollow when binky goes into labour at the same time locals garth and iona ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of sadie and rose but are also mixed up we move forward forty years to where sadie shelton is the corporate head of moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of holomade the local industry in jupitor hollow getting wind of their plans the militant jupitor hollow resident rose ratliff decides to go fight these pinstriped trouser snakes '' on their own territory and sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring jupitor hollow through a mix up they end up staying in the plaza hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as sinks in the living room '' and soaps in the shapes of swans '' ! complication piles on top of complication as sadie shelton 's ex husband michael barry primus ca n't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural sadie for his hard nosed wife and jay marshall michael gross ca n't for the life of him understand why rose ratliff is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure rose shelton all comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two sadie 's are really the city sheltons while the two rose 's are really the twins meant to be in jupitor hollow the fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when sadie shelton is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to sadie ratliff to put all her watching of her idol alexis carrington in dynasty '' to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing jupitor hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins on the classic 1960 's comedy series the patty duke show '' i dont think i 've ever seen bette midler in finer form than in big business '' her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails sadie shelton who 's all hostile takeovers '' to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin sadie ratliff who only wants to be able to say keep the change ! '' is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter her classic mirror sequence with her twin '' is a total riot and her statement that this whole thing has got ufo written all over it ! will have you breaking up with laughter equally lily tomlin as both country activist rose ratcliff i 'm gon na go kick some snooty new york ass ! and as rose shelton the awkward out of place city girl i hate shopping and i hate new york in june ! is also top rate her rejection of jay 's engagement ring as a supposed bribe '' and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a great big belly scraping pile of cow plop ! is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene i never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening i have of this movie of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at new york 's plaza hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk 's joe grifasi continual mixing up of sadie which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined and especially fabio alberici 's michele placido total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with one minute they are corporate killers the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone ! the hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women one from the country and the other from the city seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff it is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both bette midler and lily tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first classics like im gon na dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease ! '' oh my god it 's so cosmopolitan '' oh sure its full of crowds smog sex fiends and white slavers it 's a pistol i 've got about as much use for it new york as a toad has for spit pearls ! computer chips they 've got their ways ! and have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more it is a real pity that big business '' so far has marked the only time that bette midler and lily tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle this film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages i 've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as i am ! so i 'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you have n't already you wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends in bette midler and lily tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in big business '' enjoy !
while elmo going to the doctor is a good part in the video that is not the only good thing about this one it features several shorts with cartoons and different characters my favorite part of the video and my daughter 's is the part featuring ernie and bert ernie decides he is going to be a doctor and needs bert 's help so he can practice doing the things doctors do bert just wants to know if he is healthy and after putting him through several tests ernie says that he does n't know if bert is healthy or not because he is n't a he just needs 23 years of school before he can tell him if he is healthy or not ! the cartoons are funny and there is a never before seen elmo 's world at the end all about doctors too very cute

an exercise in but done so well it 's forgivable set in london circa 1910 chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill one day as he stumbles home drunk he smells gas and rescues a young girl claire bloom from a suicide attempt he nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past including a great sketch with buster keaton in which he plays the fiddle and keaton the piano it was both their swan songs the movie is autobiographical and reeks of with a number of references to chaplin 's carrer in pictures alluded to but there 's intelligence too and not a little sentimentality what chaplin picture does n't contain this but chaplin is such a demanding master that there is n't a moment of sloughing off or cheapness chaplin did everything from writing the script to composing the music and all of it is touched with genius made in 1952 the movie amazingly was not seen in hollywood until 1972
many shows have their moments but this is the first show i 've ever laughed out loud multiple times in one episode the humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed i will say that you do need to be around my age i 'm 40 to get alot of the inside jokes but if you do their hilarious and if you do n't there 's still plenty to make you laugh i would highly recommend all three volumes that are out now
just as a note that 's the japanese title there 's something about this movie that i 've always liked i 'm not sure what it is but being a pokemon fan of course i like it the movie have always been great and this one has something that i really like about it the movie starts out in the north pole with a scientist named lund his friend yuko and his son tory there is suddenly an explosion and tory is trampled by a frightened pack of walrein and as they say after that all heck broke looks a meteor is the reason for the explosion and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average pokemon deoxys a rare pokemon from another planet woah more than one niiice the strange creature carrying a rock with a gem inside is suddenly attacked by the large rayquaza a frequenter of the ozone layer so what the heck is he here for ah so rayquaza feels threatened by deoxys and so both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle with some pretty cool background music might i add so professor lund flees with his colleages and son four years later a young pokemon trainer named ash ketchum along with some friends enter the high tech city of la rousse and as fate would have it tory 's hometown and well i wo n't spoil it from there the plot is good and deoxys ' 'destructive ' intentions are less cruel than one would think do n't worry folks no angsty here also rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie his fights against deoxys are totally awesome the soundtrack is also great i really love the music played during the opening scenes of the movie and the fights between rayquaza and deoxys the animation is very spiffy shiny bright and new SMILE i have n't had the pleasure of watching the original japanese version of the movie but when i do i 'll tell you all about it 'kay well i guess that pretty much wraps things up oh yes tory 's afraid of pokemon due to the whole 'get attacked by a herd of walrein ' thing heh okay then sayanora faithful readers !
i did not have many expectations when this came out as a movie but was pleasantly surprised ! the dvd was a must own as soon as it came out
wrath of the dragon introduction the dragon ball z series is one of the finest animes out there as any fan of japanese animation will tell you the series has a love it or hate it '' reputation but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons young people love the series for the action and adventure while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time it 's no wonder the series is considered akira toriyama 's magnum opus and by far the best of the three dragon ball series when toei animation made dragon ball into an anime they did n't copy toriyama 's mangas verbatim they added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace toei even created movies based on the series ! there were thirteen movies two television specials and one while not usually canon to the storyline they are an undeniable part of the dragon ball z franchise that ca n't be ignored overview this is the thirteenth of the thirteen dragon ball z movies the story majin buu is beaten our heroes have won peace has returned yeah right just as everyone has settled down gohan and videl rescue an old suicidal man and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the dragon balls what they do n't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe the z fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe but are they strong enough review of story this is one of my favorite dragon ball z movies due in no small part to the unique storyline and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular granted i wish vegeta had a larger role but no big complaints there there is no other part of the dragon ball z series that has a storyline anything like this the interaction between trunks and tapion is excellent as well and the ending let 's just say it stands on a plane all its own you wo n't want to miss it official this is a rare example of a dragon ball z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline right after the defeat of buu this would fit into the actual series continuity it did n't exist in the original manga so i consider it unofficial but you be the judge review of dvd all of funimation 's dragon ball z dvds are pretty much the same as far as content goes there is no bonus content unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the dvd to be bonus material and honestly i could have lived without them some more recent dvds have character profiles though these are lacking and could have been written better why could n't get get interviews with cast and crew or something like that funimation has a lot of room to improve on the dvds the dubbed version lots of people tend to bash funimation 's dub of the dragon ball z series why it 's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid they can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes such as full metal alchemist but every time they 've tried dubbing toriyama 's classic they butcher it to hell the nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series stick with the uncut subbed track overall get it dragon ball z movies do n't get any better than this edition notes it was released in edited and uncut versions do i even have to say it get uncut and watch the subtitled japanese version
i really liked this dvd has a lot of information and covered a lot of their important games the special features are interesting as well
i was pleasantly surprised by this movie the sex scenes were some of the best i 've seen because they were graphic yet very realistic the story was touching and honest if you 're an adult who enjoys a realistic story that is very hot you will definitely enjoy this gem watch and enjoy
i am a huge chef ! fan i have been watching the show since it was on bbc america and my local pbs station i was excited to find that the complete collection '' was finally available on dvd i got the package and could not wait to start watching the show and that is when the dissappointment sat in i realized that shows were missing from the complete collection '' like divorice gareth 's father and the christmas special a bird in the hand '' can someone please tell me how this can be the complete collection '' with those episodes ommitted from the dvd
i thought this was an excellent excellent film i saw it for the first time last night and i was struck by how well it was acted and filmed it was directed by jean renoir so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation but it was exceptionally good in response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors i would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized the prison rooms looked like hotel rooms and the treatment of the prisoners however one should realize how different world war one was from world war two or other more recent wars wwi had a few decent reasons for being fought but primarily it was about european countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings as seen in this film and all quiet on the western front '' and the poetry of cummings many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches they fought for the ideals of their respective countries but separated from the propaganda your enemy could be your neighbor in wwii there was an obvious evil genocide to fight against that needed to be defeated but wwi had mostly stereotypes to lend menace grand illusion '' like the rules of the game '' reflects the decline of the great aristocratic families of europe that was occuring during and after wwi ancient families that had controled dynasties for centuries were left without the power they had held the world moved on and left them in anachronism a reality which von rauffenstein and boieldieu foresee much of the film is focused on the universality of the human condition it does n't deny the differences between people but it shows how the connections between people can transcend some of these barriers when faced with the reality of war
