i purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad it will run my cable modem router pc and lcd monitor for 5 minutes this is more than enough time to save work and shut down equally important i know that my electronics are receiving clean power i feel that this investment is minor compared to the loss of valuable data or the failure of equipment due to a power spike or an irregular power supply as always amazon had it to me in 2 business days
first of all why do you want a power ups there are some very good reasons 1 you never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout 2 you want to work with clean power only 3 you want to monitor your pc power 4 you want to prevent your pc from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection the first rule about ups is to never trust the insurance claim get your pc insured elsewhere these companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims i have a pc running some very high specifications with over six usb devices lcd monitor printer and ethernet equipment with everything on at the same time i have never gone above of usage and average between and when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks even though i have a power supply unit psu i will be upgrading to a psu because it is better quality model the way i can monitor how many watts i use is with ups software and hardware so the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using the short answer to this is you do n't know until you install the ups and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time you need to estimate what it is i would say a domestic pc not a server would use max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on as soon as we add things like another pc or several printers or several monitors then we can start to overload a ups this brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any ups overloading and balancing the overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the ups capacity overloading does two things it can in theory eventually damage the ups and it voids the warranty most ups are but there are and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one pc setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups for a network so check the ups rating what ups you choose depends on how much you want to load on it next thing you need to check with the ups is if it comes with a usb connection if it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your pc and the ups comes with software now if the ups has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off ups sound alarms controlling how your ups handles a blackout how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation if it sounds an alarm or not if it run self tests data collection and monitoring notifications and sensitivity settings if the ups does not come with a usb connection and software then you probably should be looking for an ups designed for computer use rather than a ups for equipment most ups have led indicators that tell you the status of the unit the next thing to understand is that testing your ups is not done by breaking it out of the box connecting it to the mains plugging your pc in and then turning off the house 's power with the circuit breaker you must charge the ups first ! so read the instructions usually you must attach the battery to the ups plug it in firmly ! and wait before using it then perform the test using the software first ! then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the pc stays up usually a ups is programmed to shutdown your pc if the blackout lasts for a few seconds nearly all ups models with a usb connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the pc should hold for on the ups battery most ups devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem this is important because power surges on a ups that do not have this protection can damage a pc through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the pc somehow this is nasty problem with the degree of security that a ups can provide if it does n't have this function then it is not going to provide 100 surge protection with a pc that is networking a ups pc to another pc without ups can also increase the risk of surge protection problems it is not recommend that you network a ups pc to a pc unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue one last thing is that some ups have input regions on the ups for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot this is everything you need to know about an ups before you choose one it is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the ups and making sure it provides you with what you need the two top brands are apc and belkin
we bought this to backup the imac that i got my wife for christmas i have had an apc since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area the overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money i 'm not sure if the powerchute software was updated to run on mac tiger howvever so i did not install it steve reis
it 's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power this person obviously did n't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the ups the notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software i agree that i was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem luckily it was easy to turn this feature off five stars for this product for sure
i ordered 3 apc es on the recommendation of an employee of mine who used to work at apc i 've had them for about a month now without any problems they 've functioned properly through a few unexpected power interruptions i 'll gladly order more if the need arises pros large plug spacing good for power adapters simple design long cord cons no line conditioning usually an expensive option
i replaced an older apc uninterruptible power supply with this one i like the power bar design which makes it easy to use it includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night it has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out one tip if you have a spare backup outlet plug your electronic phone in that way you wo n't be disconnected if there 's a momentary power outage
i already knew how good this product was before we bought it we had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer i have recently learned i might have been able to have that replaced if i had thought to follow up but i was just so thrilled to have only lost an 80.00 at that time product and not a computer when ordering mine the price had come down quite a bit since we had first purchased one i got free shipping i never even had to leave the house ! i could n't be happier ! !
wish the unit had a separate light when power to the unit is missing the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds the warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it is n't always easy to tell what is happening
electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks usually at night but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work this backup battery takes care of that problem very well it comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events the software isnt of the best design but it works no linux software but it can still be used without it the unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery i have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it
it was easy to assemble and matches another one that i bought from the same company a few years ago
i have three of these cd towers and in general i 'm very pleased with them i like the wave design and they hold a lot of cds i do n't mind having to take off a whole stack of cds to get to the one on the bottom and as long as you balance the distribution of cds properly they do n't tip that easily i always place mine next to a wall anyway my biggest problem is that they are sometimes very difficult to put together of course that is only a temporary issue although an incredibly vexing one
i 've had my wave cd storage rack for almost 5 years now and i 'm more than happy with it it 's been moved around bumped and wedged between pieces of furniture yet it has held on quiet nicely i was originally attracted to it 's wavey design which for me is more artwork than just another storage case i plan to buy another one
this product is a great deal the problem with its shakiness can be easily solved with a little imagination get two standard sized bricks and place them at the bottom of each of the two metal spires they fit perfectly friends will compliment you on your taste and sense of design as well ! they will use up about 10 cd 's worth of space but then you still have storage for about 100 standard or 200 thin ones
as someone else mentioned its not the sturdiest rack out there but it has not tipped over on me so i really cant complain it looks good and its easily put together as for the sturdy issue i look at it like this since when do you place cd racks in the middle of the room never ! ! people will typically place them in the corner of a room which is fine and you will never have an issue with the rack at all i have mine set right near the entrance of the bedroom door and i have brushed up against it and bumped elbows with it and it ever so slightly moved a little but nothing where i was worried about it falling oh and i have carpet in my room which makes it for a less sturdy foundation i have even thought about purchasing another one for dvd 's personally speaking i def recommmend this cd rack
i have never had this device fall over like others have complained of either granted i do have mine situated one a hard wood floor but even so it seems sturdy enough it is a little irritating with the wave structure how some of cds wo n't fit but other than that i find this tower really helpful it 's a nice and fun way to store your cds
the first time i saw this piece was at i had listened to sony philips jvc panasonic rca in that order the difference was instantly clear then i went back to listen to the philips again and the difference was recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to i made up my mind that if i wanted a home theater in a box htib package it will be the philips was about 10 months ago each time i stopped by the electronic section of any store i would check it out finally i decided to buy one next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews most reviews rated it high however i was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had still went ahead to buy one at fred meyer for on sale if i did not like it i will return it i reasoned i bought the black colored piece costco and radioshack had it on sale for the same price but fred meyer is closer to my home since adding this piece to our family room the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming warmer richer and entertaining than before i will address the concerns of a few reviews here 1. hissing sound i found none but discovered that if the audio out on your tv has one jacket like mine instead of two or three jackets then you need to get an extension rca jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three out jackets with the apporpriate color codes white red for two jackets and yellow for the third jacket to match the audio in jacket white and red of the dvd player otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your tv audio out to match the color codes on your philips dvd audio in otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound 2. dvd player jumping disc you are using a defective disc solution change your disc 3. back speakers not working they will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode movie stereo etc sometimes some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect so change the tv channel or your dvd disc 4. speaker wires not long enough some consumers had enough length mine were too short for our large family room too large for me to bother to measure one reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation i could not so i returned the banana plugs i bought from home depot instead i bought some digital extension cables they come in different sizes etc the smaller the size number the thicker the cable the better to avoid loss of digital signals i bought size the risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to since it will be considered tampered with but be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set you decide to use additional extension cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable the extension run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the dvd to tape over all exposed with nonconductive electric tape normally comes in black caution you need to buy enough length of extension cable though they come in and length having a large room i bought three 50 feet cables to do the job cost for each 50 ft cable was 5. wall mountings the enclosed wall mountings are fixed you can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted for less than at i bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that i can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle speaking of the sound production it is clear crisp and true theater realism the sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your your self a favor and buy one but for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables i would have given it 5 stars philips should make the plugs universally adaptable so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables if they needed to better still philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables
i was blown away by the sound quality good system at a reasonable price i would recommend this system to all my friend
i had read some other reviews stating that this home theater system makes a buzzing noise however i had my doubts so i ordered it anyway and it 's great no buzzing noise on mine at all i have an apartment and did n't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that i could n't really use anyway because of noise restrictions this system is nice and clear and gives me the home theater experience i was looking for they give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall granted the speaker wire is n't all that thick and has a proprietary connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain it still sounds great and for under 200 bucks why would you care anyway
a very good player at a very reasonable price
this is prob the best item boughten this ! ! ! totaly awsome system tv radio surround all in ! great buy
i bought this system recently after my panasonic dvd surround system broke i was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on amazon and other sites for that matter but i could n't find anything like this value and decided i could just take it back if i did n't like it well i love it ! the sound is great ! subwoofer is awesome ! i do not hear a hissing noise at all this sounds so much better than my panasonic which broke and that i had paid 100 more for
costco here too 180 was a great price but the hissing has become annoying it does sound like a larger capacitor constant constant i hear it walking through the room passing within feet of the unit the noise dissapears when tray is open only i really like it but the hiss is getting to me i notice its on sale here for 129 maybe ill shop around spend a bit more
packaging by mfg does n't keep tabs from being broken off but vendor was great
these clear jewel cases make it easy to see what you have and the slim design saves space i use them for cd 's and dvd 's i have n't had any problems with them they are a good value
these are very good for dvd or cd storage very inexpensive and very good quality people who complain below have fat fingers thats why they break the cases
just a note to those who 've been having trouble opening these cases without breaking them if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together you 'll be able to open and close it do n't sand too much and just do the top knob or it wo n't hold together i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive so i wanted to make them work hope it works for you
cheaper than thick cd cases and less prone to breakage these slim '' cases by memorex protect your cds most buyers will get them for use in cd or dvd burning and these are an affordable choice from a quality company for that purpose you may want to consider larger cases depending on your tastes but otherwise these will probably satisfy your needs
this pack offers a cheap pack of 50 slim jewel cases buying this package with a spindle of dvds or cds is much cheaper than buing cds or dvds ready in a case the look is cool and these will not break easily
i have used these for over two years now and they work absolutely great i have burned movies games files everything have n't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the dvd players i tried them out on not much else to say
i just finished a 25 package of the memorex dvd media and have reordered a 50 pack and 25 pack all my dvd burns were successful i am using a sony dvd drive and have been burning my home video creations at with mydvd software that came with the drive i have a kenwood dvd player downstairs and a sony dvd player upstairs it plays on both plus i have made copies for friends with all positive feedback i highly recommend these discs
i just burned my first home video dvd on the memorex disc it worked the first time ! i have a tdk burner installed in my dell computer the resulting disc works on my wife 's gateway laptop with dvd and also my pioneer home dvd player so far so good no coasters
the cost plus shipping still beats the sale price of a similar item at walmart works fine
this is a great product and you can get it along with any other products on amazon up to 500 free ! participate in a special promotion and get a free 500 amazon gift card at this web site
i have nothing to compare them to but i bought 3 of these and they seem to do the job they are intended to do i was surprised to see no savings on shipping when i ordered 3 vs ordering 1 at a time although i am now clear on the policy they still were a bargain as far as i have compared i would buy again from the same vendor
i was excited when i received the kingston digital card on the scheduled date it sure has a good packaging and works great an item worth having in your electronics line
i have had no problems with the secure digitial card from kingston it has performed properly for my camera and computer for transferring the pictures highly recommende
i use this card in my palm tx pda and have it filled with music and in almost two months have had no problems with it very good memory
hi i brought 256 mb kingston sd card from recently according to my openion amazon is one of the best online shopping market they deliver the products intime and the items i brought so far are working very well 256 mb kingston sd card working very good with out giving any problem one can always go to amazon for online shopping bye kira
i received it in a timely manner and am pleased with the performance of the product it may not be a top name brand but i ca n't tell any difference thank yo
i bought this card with my canon powershot the card holds a lot of pictures more than i expected even with a high resolution setting
this once available product has served me well very dynamic universal in use and user friendly what more could be asked of a simple battery backup system that does n't cost hundreds of i 'm looking for the replacement because it 's best duty is under every critical user 's computer
high speed reader that works flawlessly and at high speed all you need for your card and computer
compared to other card readers i have experienced this one is quick and easy much preferred method of transferring digital images gets the job done
i love the design and the size of this memory card reader very portable and works great reads pretty much all memory cards that are out there on the market at the moment would recommend it and would buy it again
my biggest concern when looking for a card reader was that it work on my not se machine ive only used it with compact flash but it reads and writes several brands and capacities just fine no install problems either even though the is pretty old the pop down '' door is a little goofy but i just stick a pencil in the door to keep it from closing this props it up on the desk so it is a bit easier to get the cards in and out
compact portable and works with all the popular media cards cf and i have one at home and one at the office both you can take anywhere and does n't take up alot of space easy to use plug play nice cover opens up and keeps the slots clean from dust when closed the lid opens and acts as a stand for the reader a nice angle for putting in the cards i got mine for less than 10.00 so it 's definitely worth it ! lexar has great quality and good design highly recommended
the walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses the sound is excellent but i use an older set of sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set the unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time it is quite small and the only disadvantage i 've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket
i just ordered the second one for our family it 's the sony player to join our househould they 've been very dependable and they 're easy to use the software is simple the sound is great and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time my teenagers girls love that they come in colors and they 're different than what most of their friends have mom loves that they 're affordable
this is the greatest little player ! ! ! the sound is great good bass the size is very convenient and everybody who see it wants one it fits in a pocket has an armband option or a key ring option even little speakers as an option i 've taken it on so many trips there is a caution though even though the software is good for windows plus or better you can not download from the web unless you have windows xp
this is my first portable player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls i did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what hold '' meant on the screen but other than that very nice little product good price and very easy to use
well to begin with i am a complete ipod hater the whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features does n't sit right with me but after robbing my bro of his for so long since i had none it was time to get something of my own i chose this walkman bean player the size is sick ! fits between a few fingers also it is sony a trusted company unlike apple who will give you the runaround the navigation and menu is so simple i did n't read the manual and i figured it out the only thing i read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio but that is negligible anyhow i looooove it great bargain sound investment
this product was perfect it 's a sturdy case that holds my large collection of cd 's and dvd 's my other cases were flimsy and wore out fast this one has a hard outside shell and the inside holds my dvd 's nicely so i have no complaints and at the price i paid i 'd say this was a great deal
this is a great holder especially for the price it holds an unbelievable 264 dvds ! ! ! definitely good buy
witht this memory card you will not miss anything lot of space and fast storage for your continuos shooting
with my five megapixel leica digilux 2 this lexar one gigabyte sd card will give me 244 color photographs at the jpeg setting ! that 's equivalent to ten rolls of film the write time is to me quite fast so it really performs so far i have not encountered any problems with this sd card and if it stays that way i 'll get another one
if you snap shots in burst mode or if you want to take pictures at sporting events fast cards like those are the way to go almost no lag large capacity lifetime warranty no complaints
how many pictures will it store it is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about well considering i worked in the memory industry for over 7 years i can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as i have since changed industries the lexar media sd card like most cards will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera 512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera these numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality jpeg setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera one last thing to consider when buying a card do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available a card should be an investment you need to consider quality reliability and speed with a card of this capacity worse case scenario would be you taking this card and only this card on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted then what do you do purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button i truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs
this is a very practical way to use the lost '' spot on outlets by the transformers that will use at least 2 spaces with this you can even add 2 in one contruction is good and again is practical
i have had this controller for just about two years and have had no technical issues with it at all i never installed any software for it i simply plugged it in and it has worked flawlessly ever since it may lack the frills of a more expensive controller but i am very pleased with its toughness until there is a game pad for the pc that can accomplish this level of quality while including all the other bells and whistles i 'll stick with the durability feature instead
i installed this controller on winxp while i was playing an emulated game i noticed that my keyboard did n't work and there was no way to exit out of the game to minimize the screen so i reset the computer and now the keyboard does n't work at all must be something to do with that installation cd i recommend before installing this controller to follow the instructions in the users manual on creating a restore point that you can go back to incase something like this happens
i nearly bought a logitech gamepad but saw the glowing reviews of this device i just got started back into the action and racing genres it 's got great touch and seems sturdy enough for the long haul
i bought this game pad to replace my logitech wingman rumble pad and it works great and its alot better than the wingman rumble pad i highly recommend this gamepad
this has got to be the best looking and best performing joysticks out there for the pc not only is the performance and feel of this joystick the price is also great ta
i got two of these and as others have said this is a great game pad for the money it feels sturdy and has good well placed buttons
i got this for my baby 's room i was worried about the sound quality as per the other reviews but it 's quite good though i do n't have the ear of an audiophile the bass is pretty powerful the treble is good as well there is a equalizer with 4 presets which works effectively as well the room is about ' and this stereo has more than enough capacity for this room cd 's appear to work effectively panasonic has generally had good cd support subdirectories are supported i 'm very pleased
it 's amazing how tough it is to find boomboxes that have cd players capable of playing cd 's apparently the industry has decided that most people do n't want this feature in their cd boombox they must assume people get their fix from ipods and similar devices but for those of us who 've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest ipod i think the latest version is down to a size device this is a solid player for that purpose and the cassette is also handy if you want to tape from your cd or any cd or the radio for the benefit of those you may know who still have n't gone to cd yet there are still a few of those out there as well generally this is a good product though there are a couple of drawbacks first the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries this seems kind of silly given that remotes are n't exactly power hogs now this could simply be a quirk of mine and may not be a feature of the product overall but i really did n't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one so i 've decided to live with this it 's not often it 'll be on pure battery mode the other minor complaint is that it 's not possible to within an track when playing an cd regular cd 's can fastforward within a track not sure why it does n't since every other cd player i 've come across does discman car cd player etc but it 's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view the sound equalizer is very minimal but truthfully i was n't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall and things i found no problem with the modes available and find that this is doing the job i needed it to do just fine
just bought mine last week and just like many other consumers i was searching for radio and remote advantages are 1 the only smaller desktop unit that i found with radio and remote 2 has sleep timer 30 minutes 60 minutes 90 and 120 minutes this is handy for cd 's 's and the radio 3 fairly good sound for the money 4 easy to use remote i leave mine next to the unit disadvantages are 1 earphone plug in the back of the unit when i want to plug in my earphone it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design ! 2 my biggest disappointment no resume on cd or ! i listen to alot of audio books and i find this a real inconveince ! i have to go to the track that i think i left off or write it down ! my panasonic cd small portable has this why did they forget this in this one 3 terrible reception on am static ! 4 sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use i bought this because it is the only unit with a timer and remote that i could find ! since the am radio is so terrible i ended up buying the sony so i can listen to my am talk shows this one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes a clock and easy to use overall i still give it a 4 because of it 's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes i wish i would have bought it on amazon not at radio shack they were about 25 more live and learn ! if you are looking for a all in one with cd cassette remote and radio this is about the only one that you will find and i looked for 3 months ! update september 18 2006 after owning this one month i like it better and better ! i love the sleep feature that you can use up to 120 minutes 2 hours either on the radio or the cd ! this automatically shuts the unit off it is a great feature if you are listening to a cd that contains 40 hours of 's on it and you do n't want it to play all night
could n't find a boombox that was lightweight but sounded good and had it is fine does everything i expected it gets more useage than my hi priced bose
the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette cd and radio capability so did n't have much of an option but to get this one i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality overall i think its a good buy
overall i 'm very happy i wish there was a resume feature for cds with on them other then that it 's good
i was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic but when i received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely it does come with book page holders but i do n't really use them
so i was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality so i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11 and it works i used it for two weeks now and i am pretty satisfied just like there is one more review on this item and it says that it is strong and i agree it is a great item for the money vitalijus stony
i have tried a dozen holders this is the best available others tip over easily or they hold only books of a limited size or they are large heavy bulky and therefore absurdly expensive etc this is light yet sturdy hint i included a few large metal clips the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place with the clips this bookholder works excellently well in addition it is also preforated to fit into any binder the manufacturer thought of everything on this one i keep one in the car for when i read in restaurants another at home and still a third on my office desk
because i 'm a free lance writer and reviewer i often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when i 'm direct quoting i had a book holder from another company but it was a piece of junk it would n't hold up thicker books and the thin rounded holders '' at the bottom kept popping off i even had my husband tried to fix them by shoring up the holders with tape and such it kept breaking and out of frustration i went to an office supply store to look for another one the silver fellowes book holder was all they had although the clerk assured me it was a sturdy i was skeptical i had him go into the office get me a thick hardcover book and proceeded to take the book holder out of the box to test it yes right there in the store ! i was immediately impressed with the sturdiness and snugness of the wide holders at the bottom the plastic looks flimsy but i 'm tellin ' ya this baby really does well for holding open thick books ! i 've been using mine for about a week now and love it no more headaches when i need to get a quote ! yay
i read a lot and i was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page i also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page well i finally decide to try this nice little invention and let me tell you it 's definitely worth it ! it 's cheap but the plastic works fine and does the job well it stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised the stand is adjustable it 's great it makes my life so much easier and i 'm sure glad i bought it
i read the other reviews on this bookholder and was n't so sure about it however after buying and trying it out i have no regrets do n't know why i waited soo long to get one dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one although made of plastic it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding the clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold unlike other models this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books i have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem
sometimes i need to have a few books open at the same time and still have clear desk space for note taking i used to keep one in my lap or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so i could open another not any more ! now i look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron i was what the crud was i thinking anyway this thing keeps my books open and saves space on my desk the little page holders fall out but not all the time so who cares you 're not going to loose them unless you 've got a silver shag rug that 's three inches deep and it 's not a big deal to pop them back in in truth i have two of these pretty good book things
this stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs it hold the pages open to their correct spots although the page holders come out of their holders the page holders are easy to put back in it saves space on your desk i am a medical student and i have a notebook to write down important information from books i am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks it is a great device considering bookstands are difficult to find
first of all here are my computer specs pentium 4 2.8 fsb 1 gb ram 2 sata 7200 rpm hard drives 80 gb boot drive 250 gb movie drive graphics card ati radeon pcie sound card soundblaster live vcr sony my dvd xpress model number rev 2 my purpose to archive old tapes to dvd installation of the was a quick and painless process within minutes i was already capturing my very first video this unit works very nicely with retail vhs tapes i found that it does not respond to macrovision though i only tested one tape home movies and master tapes tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts at first i captured a short promotional music video at 8 in a resolution of this produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape there are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen then i captured a longer home movie which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a dvd my original bitrate of 8 was too high and the higher bitrate was n't really helping the video quality too much but if my bitrate is too low the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a tv perform a google search for videohelp bitrate calculator '' and click on the videohelp bitrate calculator link i use the calculator to figure out what bitrate i should capture in according to the total time of all the programs i want to put on dvd below 7 seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback but it 's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies after capturing this longer movie i found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot now whenever i operate it i point a small fan at it and this seems to keep it cool and running well but keeping the unit cool should n't be the user 's responsibility so it loses points for temperature while this device works well if the input video has a stable picture a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss being copied several times i tried capturing one of these tapes which was of a tv show from 1993 and the dvd xpress did not handle it very well the result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory i am disappointed with this on the other hand i have a tape that was recorded from tv in 1988. it is the master copy so there is no generational loss dvd xpress was able to capture it just fine not once during any of my captures did audio video get out of sync so credit where credit 's due to ads tech for that after a few days of experimenting with this capture device i definitely want to keep it i look forward to finally being able to clean out my vhs closet my recommendations to other buyers understand your source and you wo n't be disappointed there is no way you can make your year old tapes look pristine again but if the video signal is strong and stable the dvd xpress should be able to capture it with no problems
i 'm a little surprised at the average low rating this product has received from other users currently i 'm running an with ram the software installed easily the first time with no problems and in no time i was recording my first transfer from a vhs player i 'm very comfortable using adobe premiere elements 2.0 so that 's what i decided to use instead of the bundled software i 've created over 25 dvd 's successfully and tonight i decided to give the direct to disk '' a try i recorded directly from the video source to the dvd and just like that i had a single session recording that looked beautiful during playback on my dvd player i have nothing but praise for the ease of use and dependability of version i have used other hardware packages on lesser systems and yes there were many problems but after upgrading to something with more power like the with ram well it was a whole new ballgame everything worked as advertised just as it should
if you do n't want to spend a ton of money and you want the best quality possible i am using the ads tech dvd express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my directv dvr onto dvd the quality is outstanding 2 quick complaints but really these are only minor things 1 setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it was n't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure the message should have said '' make sure the usb cable is plugged in directly to your mother board '' other words in the back of your computer and with a usb port that came with your computer instead of an add on easy enough fix but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple 2 on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video this has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100 pure video with no errors this is a great product n't look any where else
look for a product what do you expect first you expect it to work and i can confirm it definitely does work when plugged in to usb it signals xp correctly the driver software is very tolerant you can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device so installation is a 5 minute process next comes the capture and initial encoding well the software is a bit lame as far as features and gui typical but it absolutely saves in dvd format just as you 'd need it to for making dvds of all your dish network or or vhs content the frame rate is full on 30 fps it takes an svideo or standard rca video signal both are just fine in quality the resolutions are not that great but its passable for dvd when you crank it up do n't think you can encode some quality mpeg with this though as far as the overall durability of the product i 've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight it gets hot but its never so much as flickered or needed reset bottom line this thing is like a kids its cheesy but tough as nails get it for your first analog signal mpeg encoder its a good value
the dvd express 2.0 worked the first time i tried it it always helps to have a little knowledge of computers as most who have written reviews probably have i agree that ulead really sucks and they could have bundled better software witht he unit if you are having trouble getting this little baby going i would suggest a computer class would be apropriate
i purchased the elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i do n't have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of and sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
this one was purchased for my pocket pc have been storing files pictures and more important my recordings clearly it 's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam i got it at a really good price !
this is a great buy because i have a lot of space i use the card on my digital camera and i take a lot of pictures without download to the computer i can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until back home it 's a great card at a very good price
i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again
the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent
i 'm afraid i do n't know a lot about this technology i went for economy and i am getting very good quality photos i think i would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and i really do n't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow its still faster than my old one so i 'm generally happy hope this is some hel
i bought this memory card for my camera at first i was very dispointed when i only see on my laptop after googled around i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over i 'm able to see full after driver update just make sure you update your first
product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it i am using it in an hp 5 megapixel digital camera it will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound
i 'm a working photographer who has been after several years use getting write errors on my lexar professional cf cards 1 gb and 2 gb i contacted lexar about what to do and was told that the professional cards have a lifetime warranty and they are now in the process of replacing my cards after to exposures on each quite happy with them
i purchased these cards on recommendaton of a friend who is a professional photographer that has the same camera that i purchased the canon likes these fast cards and it 's other capacities which some other point and shoot cameras may not benefit check before you buy as this card works very well with my camera
i used this cf card with my canon rebel xt write and transfer speeds are fast enough and never keeps me waiting but this works bcoz of speed acceleration technology if your camera does n't support this technology then its of no use it comes close to usb 2.0 transfer rates february update finally this card failed after formating the card will work for snaps and will hang for ever after that and then the camera will throw a write error any amount of formating did n't correct the problem finally i have to dump it and now i am using one sandisk extreme iii and another sandisk ultra ii card both are working fine even after some bad handling
bought this card as a backup for the card i normally use and it 's been fast and dependable so far my 7 megapixel camera produces large files lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera 's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting but with this card that has n't happened yet good purchase also seemed to be at the best price point in terms of storage per dollar
i had no problems with this card and the delivery was prompt thank you muc
i purchased this media card for my nikon digital camera the 5.1 mega pixal size does n't matter i still manage to get almost 400 digital photographs and hundreds more if i adjust it to 3.2 mega pixels i would recommend this media card to anyone with a digital camera
after going through the reviews i bought this cf card for my canon digital rebel so far it has worked fine though i do n't pretend to be an expert digital photographer when the card is empty it shows 127 shots available it seems to read reasonably fast though it takes a bit longer than i was used to with my olympus and its smartmedia card
after amazon got off there and decided to deliver this item which took 2 weeks everything has been really good the speed has helped my camera 's performance olympus paid 56 dollars for it and am quite satified with purchase
if you own a canon camera canon does not support wa write acceleration feature of lexar 's cards http current camera partners supporting write acceleration technology professional other than that this is a fast card if your camera supports wa otherwise it may run at just standard speed and in that case why spend the extra look up your camera on the link before you buy
the one in our bedroom would n't always work could n't hear the kids calling i was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice both my dell charger and thinkpad charger had the same effect even without the laptop plugged into the charger if your having problems i would start with unplugging other things first overall these have been a godsend wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house used to drive me crazy
i have a 4300 square foot home i have purchased novi wireless intercoms in the past and need to add to them one has been in the room above the garage one in the kitchen and one in the basement near the computers those locations are not on the same circuit i have never had any trouble getting them to work i 've just had a couple wear out in fact at our old house we could pick up communications from our neighbors across the street who had a set and we finally each decided which channel we 'd use so we did n't hear each other 's conversations ! you might want to remember that when you use them ! clearly our neighbors intercoms were n't on the same circuit they were n't even in the same house ! maybe the newer ones mine are at least six years old but they are novi wireless intercoms that you plug into the wall have changed but i 've never had a problem like the one described maybe it 's peculiar to the westinghouse brand
i just purchased this unit and once i finally got it working i could not be more pleased just be warned that it was not as easy in my two story home to just plug one in upstairs and come downstairs with the other and have it work right away maybe i just have some funky '' wiring in this house but i had to make about 6 trips up and down those stairs with a friend standing by the unit i wanted in the master bedroom while i tried various plugs upstairs until we finally got the things to work all the electrical receptacles work fine so i do n't know why it did not work on the first try once working they are great just keep in mind flexibility of placement in the event you have an experience similar to mine i 'm going to order another set to use between the den and my husband 's workshop and feel they are a great deal for the cost and so much easier than a hard wired '' system
i bought this card to go with my canon and have not been let down i can get about 500 jpegs and 300 raw sandisk makes highly constant products i can set the to take high speed continuos shooting and take 5 raw pic 's and not have the card slow down my camera very happy with it
this is a good compact flash card this is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive
i received this item for use in a new digital slr camera it is fast and stores excellent pictures
this card is fast and is the right price it holds tons of high res jpegs and around 200 raw images on my rebel xti highly recommended
bought this card along with a rebel xt as a gift for my girlfriend it 's been performing without a hitch so far though on burst mode there is transfer lag in that the pictures take a lot faster than can be transferred to the card and so after the burst the pictures are still being written to memory
i have an eos digital rebel and was looking for a memory upgrade at first i thought to buy a sandisk memory but due to the price fall of memory cards i decided to buy the card instead when i inserted the card into the camera it recognized the card right away reporting a whopping 575 photos in format or 262 in raw format that 's more than i need even for a one week vacation trip but if i upgrade my camera on christmas it may come just right for storage i may not be very technical about this but the read and write speed was noticeable faster than my previous two year old memory card about twice as fast either for browsing or saving pictures i have always trusted in sandisk products and this card is no exception quality and performance is as good as i expected
i have been using cf card now for a while in my nikon i have been very pleased with its response time in multi shot mode it keeps up with the camera and i never have to wait highly recommended
hard to be verbose about a cf card but it has performed without a hitch in my rebel xt used a ultra ii when i bought the camera a year ago picked up the card before a family vacation in august excellent product no worries
i have had nothing but good experiences with sandisk products this ultra ii card keeps up with my new nikon without any problems it 's speed is also a plus when transferring the files to my pc
this is very well designed it give you 4 usb port but two on opposite sides this is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides you webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right the cord that plug in from the hub to the computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the hub in all kind of angles it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires it also works great if you jsut want to charge you usb devices on the go it come with a plug in ac adapter so you do n't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices
i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must '' plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
this review pertains specifically to the targus 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub the cord is about 2.5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
pros small cute comes with a power adaptor i have 6 devices hooked up to it including 2 usb hard drives and it works fine without the adapter a big plus for me most hubs would not work with this setup usb 2.0 1.1 6 devices hooked up 3 low speed and 3 high speed all work very well runs cool cons not sure why but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and ports on the other this is dumb if you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward all ports should be on the back and leds on the front here the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you do n't see them the hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated overall the best hub i 've ever had and i tried many
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue
you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires i keep my cpu under the table only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price
this hub takes care of old power issues i had with smaller unpowered hubs it is handling my pda usb jump drive high capacity external drive and printer and i still have 3 more ports and i have n't had any usb power alerts from my computer since i added this hub it does what it says
truely wireless the remote alert sender unit runs on 4 aa batteries i do n't know yet how long they last mine are now two weeks old and still good the unit senses when any movement passes by i live in the country and now i know when someone comes in the yard before i would n't always hear the car only drawback is that it picks up deer dogs and other critters walking past at all hours of the day and night i like this unit it serves a purpose for me that other people may not have but it works as advertised and nothing gets past it without it alerting me the range is said to be 1000 that is probably correct mine is about 300 fromt he reciever unit and it works great the two way voice '' speaker is the icing on the cake i love being able to yell at the neighbors dogs to get on out of here '' it 's a real hoot to watch the surprise they get when my voice comes out of the tree i have less problems with the neighbor 's dogs coming into my yard and bothering 'my ' pets now
the dazzle is perfect i have used it to transfer from my husband 's camera sony memory stick from my camera comapctflash from my ipaq sd card and will try it with my new camera sd card it 's is way easier than bringing the usb cord and each camera with me this is one of the best purchases this has ever made i have had this for over 2 years with no problem
simply plug and play additionally dazzle reader shows up as a separate drive under window 's easy to move files back forth to the reader only glich is the stand very wish they had a better stand but the product is great and excellent price too
this is a great product i would recommend people to buy dazzle card reader i had this for over 3 months or so have not have any problem i would say but this one when a deal come by ! d
this reader and writer is absolutely fantastic ! i bought this after returning the biostar 6 in 1 reader from that unit would not read two smartmedia units i had but the dazzle knocked it out like a champ i use it for compact flash and sm 4 different brands and everything works great on the dazzle after the rebate the price is hard to beat !
this is a great purchase i 'm very happy with the performance quality and time to charge
they last and last but get two pairs so you have some spares need to recharge every week whether or not you use them a great product
i have been using a minolta digital camera the batteries that came with it were only 1600 mamps i never got through an entire ballgame without having the batteries run dry of course i carried a spare set but this was less than ideal i got these 2000 mamp monsters and i must say they deliver what they promise as a result i 've really not needed the backup set even when shooting games that went into extra innings ! the charger is well made very quick and has easy leds to see the charge status from across the room overall this has been a great purchase
just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers it does just what it 's intended to do produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit i had no trouble at all with the remote it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the ipod from a good 10 feet away my only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful ! altec lansing could do well to improve their instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself i was almost ready to return my unit initially when i discovered only by accessing altec lansing 's web page for the that i had to remove the plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my ipod photo otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price
when i bought it couple weeks ago i look out side the box is but inside the box speaker is i call the company they told me is as they said someone on the internet sell the is all same with the and also support the ipod video too
i bought mine for travel purposes and use the jbl on stage more when i am at home the jbl does sound better but i got a decent price on the altec it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option so i took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night thats 4 aa per night not exactly cheap i think that those who complain about the lack of battery options in other speakers do not quite understand exactly how many batteries they will be using i was out of the country but i still wish now that i wouldve taken my heavy '' adaptor with me you live and learn i guess everyone has special needs but in this case i can tell you 1 set of 4 batteries would last only 1 night so these are a decent set of speakers if the price is right packs well for travel but dont expect mindblowing sounds as its just a tiny lightweight speaker system its ok id give it more of a 3.5 star if i could
i am very happy with this product it folds super slim so traveling with it is a breeze ! pretty good sound not bose quality but for the price very respectable ! i 've had it almost a year and it has been along on many weekend and works great i use it alot so it was a good purchase for me
great sound quality powerfull enough to fill my living room though probably not with 25 people in party mode with a small footprint the remote requires you to point it somewhat accuretly at the speakers and is not as responsive as a remote for a tv probably because the remote is tiny and only has a battery so not enough power overall very good quality for a reasonable price
this system worked great for my 40 gb ipod the carrying case and interchangable are nifty for international travellers a word of warning the 60 gb ipod photo does not fit in the docking station altrec insisted that it does at the time i purchased it in july 2005. be sure to order the altec for ipod and ipod photo '' that is now available if you have the photo ipod
i do n't have much room on my desk but this copy holder fits perfectly and is still sturdy enough to hold up most texts
this is working out real well as a notebook stand for me you ca n't beat the pric
this product is retty good but do n't even try putting a bood on it the holder will tip over and it does n't clip the pages of a book very well but for papers it 's good and it 's adjustable which is convient it did hold my notebook very well but for books it sucks
this holder keeps papers upright and in position but it does n't handle books particularly well as the clip can not grip surfaces as thick as most books and the base is n't as wide as most books when they 're opened i have this and a book stand so i keep myself covered on both ends
i 'm amazed simply amazed the price is way out there and this obviously is n't for everyone but it does everything it says well set up is super smooth get the manufacturer and model number type it in during set up on your computer and it is done thats it i do have multiple lighting and heating controls and it is a snap to set up as well and then you can have the remote send the setup information to other controllers as well tip do n't buy their lighting controls way over priced anything that is will work leviton sells a line for of the price
i have to say that i was a little bit skeptical because of the large price tag but found out through research that this product was actually fairly priced due to the custom programming features it had i quickly found out that this remote was better than other universals out there because it used rf and was able to control multiple av systems in my house i have not done it yet but i plan to buy the lighting products so i can turn off all of my lights at once from bed each night ! ! ! very cool
i bought this reader because i wanted to avoid having my camera and all its cable attached to my pc to download the pictures and with this reader i could leave my camera and its cables in its case and just download the picture with the memory card i recomend this product
i have used the device numerous times since the purchase and would highly recommend it would buy it again
works fine for me but found it on kodak web page for about half the price thank you
i was impressed with the quality of pictures i got with this memory card i have a very inexpensive camera but the pictures are terrific
this is a high quality product and can be used in several digital cameras with great results
i gave this to my nephew for his birthday hold lots of pics and videos at least 250 pics i would n't say it ever cost as much as the marked down '' price but was a savings for the same capacity card at the discount retail stores about 15 cheaper i am pleased
this card has all of the memory space required for my personal use i would recommemd it to others
bought this item over a year ago and have had no problems with this card it holds lots of pictures depending on your settings and has n't caused me any problems well worth the money ! i take lots of pictures of my son and anytime we go anywhere new so it gets used a lot
how many pictures will it store it is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about well considering i worked in the memory industry for over 7 years i can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as i have since changed industries the kingston secure digital memory card like most cards will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera these numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality jpeg setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera i truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs
sd cards are dropping in price on a daily basis it seems i do n't like to use too large of a capacity since my tragic event at disney took place i had a 256 card and an error happened on my camera which i have since trashed for this incident and bought a new nikon but anyway i had over pics on my card and could only pull off about 40 of disneyworld i cried so as a suggestion clean off your memory cards after each event and do n't go for the or the cards unless you are putting video on it or etc now i am a happy person once again since my hubby 's going to take me back to dw to replenish those missing pics ! SMILE
bought this card for my xda i pda worked fine right out of the box however this only showed up as card ! ! ! not sure if this is the sd card itself or the pda causing the loss of some worth of space also it is slow to write to the card but quite fast when reading from the card
the card works great in my camera what more is there to say
how good an alarm clock is basically comes down to this when you set the alarm with the three or four settings you need to do alarm noise volume and in this case the track you want it to play or if you want it on shuffle or not does it actually do what you specified the settings to do the sony dream machine does and it features two equally accessible alarms as well so that husband and wife or husband and husband or wife and wife as the case may be do n't need to argue over how to set the alarm for two morning schedules along with convenient and easy to understand buttons for the radio presets and cd player controls important note the two alarm settings are completely independent of each other so one person can wake up to a cd and the other to a favorite radio station if they like my wife is from japan for instance and she wants a japanese pop cd in there while i 'm partial to waking up to npr news best feature the snooze button it can be pressed multiple times at a shot to set how much time thereafter you want it to make another attempt at waking you up to an hour later and it 's generously sized so that you can find it easily when you 're not quite all there yet worst feature the lack of any sort of backup battery for this price they should just put in a long term one like computers have providing just enough power to startup the system and remember settings i 'm pretty sure a battery like the one sony features in my video camera circa 1998 bought in japan would do the trick while only needing very periodic replacement sound good not excellent but it 's an alarm clock not a stereo for a kid 's room or for your general purpose needs the sound quality is plenty good no one needs 100 watts per channel crystal clear sound to wake up to in the morning and this little appliance does an exceptional job of serving both as an alarm clock and a handy and attractive stereo it 's perfect for not only the bedroom but the kitchen as well for the performance to price ratio you could only do better by blowing the wad for a bose unit not for younger people will probably be fine with it say as a gift but if they 're from the wwii generation or earlier forget about it in fact forget anything with buttons or digital displays sony makes really excellent clock radios with the same reliable analogue features your grandparents have come to enjoy growing up but much improved and they 'll appreciate the thoughtfulness of such a gift much better while this thing would just gather dust somewhere and be an entire waste of money or source of annoyance if i had to remark on one real downside to this unit it 's that the backlight really is too bright to sleep with it pointing at your face and be close enough to reach without getting up while being on a setting that is readable when you 're still add that the control for the brightness is not conveniently located it 's on the back so you could n't just reach over in your state brighten it then turn it back down they should have added a feature like outdoor electronics have such as cycling computers and gps units where you can press a button it lights up for a moment then goes back to it 's preset brightness bottom line the best most reliable and enjoyable alarm clock i 've ever owned it 's durable easy to clean looks nice and features two utterly independent alarm settings so you 'll only need one in addition to generous preset buttons and easy controls it 's really worth just exactly what amazon is charging for it
one thing i do n't like about this clock radio is that it does n't have a backup battery currently i usually do not need to rely on the radio waking me up in the morning but when i do i make sure my palm pda is beside the bed to wake me if there was a power outage i tried the weather channels once and it did n't pick up very well i have an older sony clock radio that loses time that i can use for weather that picks up weather just fine what makes this a winner for me is the extendable snooze and nap timers now if i want to take a nap i do n't have to mess with setting one of the alarms i just push one button several times and it 's all set i would buy the alarm clock for that feature alone i use the extendable snooze occasionally but i do n't know if there is a point at which it no longer works some alarm clocks for some unknown reason limit the number of times you can press the snooze this makes it unusable for me because i do n't trust myself knowing that when i am half asleep ! sound quality is great i like how you can set the track of the cd and how loud it should be all in all a pretty good clock radio but if you rely on it and do n't have a backup the lack of battery backup is a serious problem
just purchased this sony cd alarm clock and i have to say most reviewers are right on target while it has superior sound quality and features than the competition the rear light is very bright and the clock display is almost impossible to read from more than a few feet away i placed a piece of electrical tape over the rear light unit to dampen the brightness and have decided to keep my sony dream machine alarm clock plugged in next to the new one so i can see the time display off the old one from my bed still a satisfactory buy because the competition produces hard to work poor sounding crap
it was missing the fm antennae but i was not intending to use the system for the radio overall it is a great system ! ! walt illinoi
the cd trays are a little flimsy but this audio system really packs a whollop the sound is excellent for the price it has a lot of features such as control a sleep timer and five cd trays to get an enjoyable sound i 'm willing to take the risk that a tray may break i just try to be extra gentle with the trays
wanted this for the new office and it fit perfectly on the desk looks great and has great sound the unit has a quality feels not plastic '' the remote works well and i particularly like the fade mute makes it easy to use
strengths sound design controls changer compact design weaknesses remote is not well designed all buttons the same size does n't recognize folders on cds summary i was shopping for a shelf system and this one caught my eye so i got it the sound is excellent in my opinion for such a little system the displey is also nice very bright backlight which can be turned off great when you like to sleep in the room while the system is still on overall i am extremely satisfied the only minus is the remote it has a lot of buttons and they are effectively the same size i would prefer big ones for important things like volume play forward
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
i ordered a lexar media multi card reader i did n't know there was such a thing when it came everything worked perfect and for a price everyone could afford
completely satisfied with the lexar media multi card reader simple and easy to use
easy to hookup and windows xp displays the drives of the lexar easy to drag and drop files into the drives highly recommended
i used lexar media multi card reader in my fujitsu laptop via a usb 2 adapter it 's truly without any need of drivers in windows xp
this is very well designed it give you 4 usb port but two on opposite sides this is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides you webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right the cord that plug in from the hub to the computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the hub in all kind of angles it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires it also works great if you jsut want to charge you usb devices on the go it come with a plug in ac adapter so you do n't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices
i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must '' plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
this review pertains specifically to the targus 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub the cord is about 2.5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin
pros small cute comes with a power adaptor i have 6 devices hooked up to it including 2 usb hard drives and it works fine without the adapter a big plus for me most hubs would not work with this setup usb 2.0 1.1 6 devices hooked up 3 low speed and 3 high speed all work very well runs cool cons not sure why but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and ports on the other this is dumb if you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward all ports should be on the back and leds on the front here the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you do n't see them the hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated overall the best hub i 've ever had and i tried many
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue
you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires i keep my cpu under the table only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price
this hub takes care of old power issues i had with smaller unpowered hubs it is handling my pda usb jump drive high capacity external drive and printer and i still have 3 more ports and i have n't had any usb power alerts from my computer since i added this hub it does what it says
i like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs just set back and relax covered
sandisk cf is all i have never had a problem one card went through the wash and still works perfectly
in general i have realised that cf cards have a years life this is my cf card in 5 years and my sandisk card my first also sandisk is still working but its only so not very useful on long trips except as backup with a 5 megapixel canon this card stores about 200 highest resolution images have used this for only 3 months so far but have noted that the ultra ii is definitely faster than others quality and life seems to be better than the viking cards i have used but time will have to tell how true that is
my compact flash card works just fine good here very fast a very happy custome
i was thinking about buying a card but after reading one of the reviews i bought two 512 card just in case that something went wrong which to me made a lot of sense i 'm please
i bought this card about 6 months ago when i received a nikon coolpix 5700 as a gift i have to say this card has never let me down it writes images like there 's no tomorrow and it has n't failed me once i have n't lost a single image and i do n't plan on it while using this card sandisk has done it once again buy from amazon i paid 20 more staples for it
i 'm not beholden to the sandisk brand and did quite a bit of research and the overall reviews tend to point to this product as a great value in fact the ultra ii '' title does live up to its name and am very happy with the performance of this product canon takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace even at the highest resolution download is speedy too i went for two cards instead of a single card for redundancy keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason highly recommended
i have always been very pleased with the sandisk products i would highly recommend them
i bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my nikon and i 've certainly had no regrets i have n't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write but it 's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in mode the card is always ready when i am downloading from the card to computer via my sandisk imagemate is fast too i like it so much i 'm buying a second one today
after reading reviews on every brand sold at amazon i picked pioneer since it was about the only brand that did n't have any complaints i have only had it for a few days but the unit does exactly what is supposed to and does it excellent it uses disks only but since i never have used disks that option is irrevelent to me
when i first got the headphones i was frustrated they seemed quiet not much bass did n't sound that great what i 've read in other reviews is very true having them seated in your ear properly makes all the difference ! i do n't normally like things inside my ears but i pushed it in farther and made them seat right and now very nice not as loud as my other pairs of headphones but they do n't need to be they also cut out like of outside noise which means you do n't need as much volume i 've actually used these on plane trips just to cut out noise even though i was n't listening to music at the time i hope you enjoy them as i do
great sound quality although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt i recommend keeping the setting on bass '' because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear the case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of it takes to get them properly in there other than those minor issues its great i prefer these over any creative earbuds
one thing you will read in reviews when people first use the headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are not reccomended to use while running bycycling or driving a car i use them for long airplane flights long walks between classes and relaxing at home and these headphones are fantastic once you get it situated in your ear correctly it takes a few tries to figure it out you wo n't want to take them off they are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format if all of your music is encoded in at you ar n't doing yourself justice i have some songs in apple losses and some in acc vbr and i am very happy with the sound quality the clip located about inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla bass and high definition the bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly for those who complain that the earphones are n't loud enough and the high definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat overall i am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them they are worth much more than the 67.00 i paid for them
these earphones are great quality the sound is good and they fit comfortably in the ear once you get used to them two minuses make them only 4 out of 5 stars first the customer support is weak there is supposed to be a website for the product for customer support and replacement parts but altec lansing his it linked to a seemingly unrelated product second the volume control is a little heavy unless you have somewhere to clip it to this might be a problem for runners
i purchased these headphones because i needed isolation from noise and these did the trick the sound quality is great and the quality of the headphones themselves is first rate the noise isolation is good for work planes anywhere the noise level is too high irecommend them for the price
first these phones are great but i want them in if you do n't get a good ear seal they will sound treble is silky the mids are natural and the bass is tight well defined and should know bass i 'm a bass player of 40 years and it 's like being at a live sells these for 73 with nextday yours take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price it 's the best deal out sound quality is sony are from bassin j
this is not my first inearmonitor purchase prior to the i have been using etymotics both amped and unamped which i had considered the absolute for the buck monitors my background includes an interest in '' since around 1960 and several years with guitar string bass piano etc are the new champs in the under 250 price category and strongly comparable to shure and ety negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem 's are insertion is directed to the front and upwards this is the natural direction of the ear canal also do n't be afraid of going too deep with them you can not hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal the is very good in presenting the details of a recording they are derived from etymotic drivers but they are also very my personal choice of tips for them is shure softflex they fit perfectly if you need foamies then comply works very well the only questionable choice made by altec lansing was to put an resistor module with them giving you a choice of using them unamped from a player or switching the module to hd position for more refined sound which is best when amped imo module also has a volume control the downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line while i do n't like this module for my usage i can see where others could rejoice in its ' inclusion the design is very attractive and i sometimes think of getting a second pair of them simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me these 's are now my choice for portable listening
i had been shopping for a pair of headphones with the ability to block out background noise for sometime now since i work in a loud environment i had been really shy about buying this pair or any for that matter because some reviews were n't favorable i was nervous however i bought these because of the name altec lansing has in audio i was shocked when i first listened to them i had to replace the rubber tips and use the foam ones because the rubber ones were just not that comfortable but wow ! the clarity of these phones are incredible no matter what others said about these i found the bass to be tight but not booming if someone wants booming bass like what would be heard in nightclubs then they need to stay away from headphones period if you are searching for a pair of iems then if i were you i would seriously consider this pair just make sure the seal is tight and they are in all the way which i never really found that to be an issue i do n't really understand what others were doing wrong with that if you bought these i highly recommend it you would not be sorry i am thouroughly impressed with mine
this product works well you can change the base part in order to fit a variety of holders theres room to plug in an fm transmitter on the port dock on the underside i can even fit my ipod in this with a speck silicone case on it which is convenient
great produce much more conveinient when you have multilpe riders in the car so that they can share
after i bought my ipod a charger a tape adapter an fm broadcaster a case a running wheel and a water bottle i decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car these little belkin numbers are quite nifty they hold the ipod in a nice position in my cupholder such that i can glance down at it instead of picking it up when i need to review the songs overall a nifty product now even better that it 's a little cheaper
with a price here on amazon far better than some of the stores this was an easy purchase to make my car has unusually large cupholders yet by simply flipping the base of the tunedok over i still managed to get a tight fit with no wobbling for my ipod
if your ipod has a protective cover skin casing etc then the ipod will not fit in the holder of this kit otherwise you can fit a bare uncovered ipod on it well the kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes including adjustable cupholders the holder swivels so you can have your ipod facing straight up or at various angles the opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the ipod the holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the ipod it actually holds the ipod well
other reviews mention three cup sizes more specifically there are cupholder inserts small and large a special bottom attachment for either of those to be used in cupholders plus a foamy cushion wrap that can be added to either of the cups for extra fill and stability that makes at least six possible combinations enough to fit any need and yes the holder tilts and the cupholder insert swivels to give you the best reading angle but it doesnt tilt too loosely you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs it 's even a bit allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt lastly the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom now top of the insert making a very nice desk stand for when i 'm not in the car
this item is very useful for my car because it does n't have any unocuppied space near to the cigarette lighter socket i find it very useful
i purchased this to use in my lg mobile phone i have used it for 's and has been working fine i initially had some problems with playing the 's but found that verizon had the setting turned off on the phone once i corrected this the mini sd has been working fine only once i had to eject it and reinstall it due to a read error but that may have been a function of the lg not the mini sd card no problems since
must say that the item was better than i expected thanks to the seller and will buy again ! ! !
i purchased the mini sd 512 mb flash memory card for my lg 8100 to enhance the memory in the phone it was easy to install and i could use it right away also it came with an adapter for the larger sd so i can take the card to develop the pictures from the phone if i so desired
it work very good and i have found nothing wrong with it
this expansion is great now i have over 120 songs loaded in my phone great media player
if you have a flash this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots though i highly recommend this product over the light sphere as they both have about the same visual effect but the light sphere costs dramatically more this device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight no need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky this thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time looks aside what does it do it diffuses your flash 's light so you get a softer and more look to your flash no more pictures looking like you 're shining a spotlight on people this has a more natural soft light '' look to it i highly recommend it for indoor use because you 'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source and the spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room the only downside is that since it is softening the light you may need to adjust your flash output you may have to dial up your exposure meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage the tradeoff is irritating sometimes but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos
this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed the white box is for general use also available are the green for florescent lighting and the gold for a warming effect pros inexpensive solution for better flash photography a quality product that works cons reduces the amount of light cast upon subject should be expected with these types of products
i am probably one of the most impared people on the planet i rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards i only notice substantial jumps in sound technology i am very reserved about getting soundcards as i dont think i ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound i have gone from a adlib to a sb to to audigy ls and now to this card that being said this is probably the last card i will even pick up or need the sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards and is amazing clear i love the front panel for adding my headphones if i need them i couldnt be happier with the price i paid or the product itself amazing buy i cant say enough good things i dont speak geek about the improvements its like you know what you like and i love this card
everything i have tried to do with the sound card has been easy to do great sound great hardware and good software
i have had the platinum for about one month i upgraded from soundblaster 5.1 a big upgrade i have an asus motherboard amd processor and nvidia video and have not had any problems at all i got the card to record vinyl to cd i have about 500 albums the advantage of the connections straight from the amp to the card were the selling point i have recorded some albums over 30 years old and they sound fine the recording software that came with the card works just fine from simple record to three levels of effects i have put recordings from the records on my and burned cd 's better sound than a casette tape and i 've just scratched the surface with the software features i have a great improvement in overall sound and there are many uses for the features on the card and the software applications that come with it all i need is more knowledge on how to use all of the features the card is expensive but worth it particularly if you have a specific use for it take the plunge and enjoy the best sound available you deserve it
first off not a perfect product far from infact takes a bit of tinkering to work right and the instructions ar n't really clear i had the audigy 2 zs before this sound card and it was a simple install card install drivers and your good to go huge improvement over the onboard this was the first problem the fact that i had drivers on my system from a previous sound blaster card had to sweep them from my system my next problem was that the drivers that come with the card are beta at best and have conflicts with motherboard chipsets and video cards but nothing that updates from there website wo n't fix the original drivers must be installed first now why would i give a sound card that ships with sub par drivers a 4 out of 5 the sound is incredible if the audigy was step up from the onboard then the is a giant leap great for games and movies
hardware was a breeze to about 20 minuets including the for the software no quality is much improved over my old live battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 9700 i would freeze framing during start in rooms and during game play in intense with the i have none of that and the game runs much smoother overall dvd movies sound much improved music is also much improved the only problem ive had burning expanded 's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far software interface is also a bit lack luster but is functional card is worth the price hopefully upgrades will improve interface
the last soundblaster i had used was a soundblaster live a couple of years ago since then i 've been relying on onboard sound on nforce based motherboards sound quality was okay but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs i decided to upgrade to the when i started to have sound dropouts while playing oblivion sound quality from the is great especially with headphones i 'm only using the drive bay panel for the headphone jack but the price of the platinum version was n't much more than just the basic card so it was money well spent if i had this set up as a media center pc the remote control functions would make this an even better deal a few notes had no problems installing this on an based motherboard asus deluxe drive bay only comes in black if you still have a tan case you 're out of luck is a digital spdif output available on the back of the card it 's a mini '' jack and unfortunately no adapter to rca jack is included
i 've been a turtle beach lover because i 'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but ca n't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio the quality turtle beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value been using santa cruz for years and it runs great after upgrading and to found the santa cruz seems to be lagging usually about glitches sudden stop of sound during playback it might be my system 's problem but anyway upgrade to montego ddl fixed the problem used optical output on montego ddl and it sounds good enough to me but montego ddl has a microphone problem too low volume that i ca n't live with so i tried only intention is to get the microphone problem fixed instead of getting better audio quality when i put it with i ca n't believe the quality it delivers i 'm not audiophile but the difference is so obvious that everyone can tell some people complain about no optical output on xtrememusic and no ddl on the whole line but you really do n't need to man the quality from 3 stereo cables at is way better than optical output from montego this is when i reallized that for audio products you need listening to compare instead of looking the spec to compare xtrememusic should be good for most people but i still bought platinum version for future proof anyway in my value not quality oriented mind i still vote for creative this time creative beats turtle beach this time beats it really hard of course the microphone is fixed too
all i can say is that they are good sleeves and they are nice to have to protect
memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect cds and dvds from lying around gathering dust the paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing cds and dvd discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage it costs less to mail cd and dvd media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same cds and dvds in slim jewel cases this savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves ! the color white is neutral and does n't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the cd or dvd i agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap this ensures that the cds and dvds do n't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another they are also useful for people who have accumulated so many cds and dvds that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room overall these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price i highly recommend these paper sleeves for people who want a practical and alternative to jewel cases
i purchased a pack of these memorex sleeves or a memorex version very similar to these at circuit city without first looking at the price i was astounished to be charged 7.99 plus tax i purchased the same sleeves at walmart later the same day for ciruit city has great prices on many things particularly electronics but these miscellaneous items can be waaaay overpriced same is true of many items at office max i am not aware of dvd or cd sleeves that are cheaper than these memorex sleeves when purchased from walmart or a simlar discounter at least and they get the job done these sleeves are fairly light paper but not nearly as light as the sleeve in which a netflix or blockbuster dvd is stored in these sleeves do have a flap so the entire cd or dvd is protected
these are simply envelopes for your cds and dvds ca n't say anything else about them except this i noticed when i opened the box they came in 'my ' sleeves were wrapped tightly with a rubber band which caused them to be somewhat crumpled upon removing the rubber band it did not really affect them adversely but just be aware that yours may come this way also
the 50 pack are all white and the window in the front is a useful feature lets you see what 's on there without resorting to opening the envelope the tab on the back helps keep the disc from falling out a nice touch
what 's to say they 're paper sleeves for cd 's
this is the ipod i 've ever had and i 've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago for gym work commuting planes no real problems so far the size is excellent the look is sheek and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than i was told it was going to be battery life is not too bad i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red i am dissapointed by the 500 songs is really nothing for people who 've been buying cds for years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions i was also dissapointed that you ca n't do anything with playlists on the ipod basically everything eg creation of playlists deletion of songs moving around of songs has to be done on the computer uploaded to the ipod recommended for and frequent travelers
excellent player by apple thin and very easy to use buttons i bought it for my son and he loves it the itunes software allows you to copy the cd into your library the moment you load it however i found it difficult to copy songs into ipod from cd the software is very confusing you have to first load the songs into library and then into ipod there is no direct way sometimes the software would hang when synching songs also i could not figure out how to easily load pictures on ipod it would be a great product if apple can add fm radio in it with a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back it is a obvious choice over other player
great battery life easy to use all around good the only minus is the dependency on itunes
i bought this as a gift and the person loved it great deal for the money
it 's conviently small but not too small to lose in a purse backpack etc but it has horrible battery life i 'm in college and listen to it while walking between classes or in the gym and i have to recharge just about every other day other than that it 's great just be prepared to have to recharge it all the time
overall very enjoyable sleek design and easy to use wish i had waited for next generation release a month or so after purchase to get lower price during transition could get a few more things included for the cost but the value is good
this ipod was great while i could use it then my wife took it and now i only see it when she needs me to recharge it ! ! i guess it is safe to say that she likes it too ! !
very happy with the nano it was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly she struggled a little with the volume being to low which was disappointing till i played with the settings a little i am a tech specialist so it 's second nature to tinker and found that there was a second master volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when raised that and happy listening ! good buy good product good amazon !
this is a tv card i used to replace my aged lifeview card so i could trinidad tobago games from tv during the world cup in june the tv quality is the best i ever seen from a tv card to date give that it is an ati based card this is really good stuff unfortunately the software package has let me down the card came bundled with cyberlink powercinema in day to day usage of my computer i like to have the fm radio function on with the old card and party fm radio software there was no issues at all with this new card i often ca n't even load a webpage without the music sticking and stuttering this on a computer with ram and 2 hard drives ! i definitely blame the software for this if the sticking becomes too much then the radio stops altogether i 'm forced to close and power cinema to listen to radio again tv is at least stable while doing other stuff but you ca n't shrink powercinema down to a window also there is a 2 second lag between tv and computer watching the same tv station this never occured with the old card intervideo 's windvr used with this card had no such issue it 's a pity i do n't have xp media center edition xp pro i have to compare xp 's media center software with somehow i think media center will perform better windvr works better too barring that the software currently has no sound support for the card powercinema works but it 's not very intuitive the software is written for the novice user with no advanced options at all when recording you do not know exactly what quality you 're using outside of good '' better '' or best '' you ca n't even change the default recording folder ! i am sure that this occurs with other brands of theatre 550 pro cards not just msi 's version as a side note the remote that comes with the card works well in conclusion it 's a card worth getting if you can deal with powercinema 's issues or find a better program to use with the card
just finished burning through my first box of these and they are terrific not one was a dud i always trust all khypermedia blank disks cause i have never had a problem with them do n't hesitate to buy yourself a box of these to use for your own project because they will last you forever great bargain for a great produc
i own many lexar memory cards and am very satisfied with their performance however i must add that lexar usa provides excellent service i live in cape town south africa whilst i was formatting one of my lexar cards in my nikon i terminated the formatting halfway accidentally card was damaged sent card to lexar usa after logging the problem in their website and within 10 days i had a brand new card couried to me by lexar no questions asked this is outstanding service ! ! ! well done lexar expectations
fast times are a must for me i am pleased so far with the card
awesome product fast data collection and holds about 450 photos i would purchase again
lexar compact flash cards have a good reputation amongst many digital photography professionals the wa '' feature provides added value to distance this card from the competition excellent return on investment ! a must buy '' o
when i bought my camera the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package it was very quick far faster than any of the cards i had on hand even those that were of the previous generation of professional '' lexar cards my camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card to the point that i can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly my only complaint is in the card 's reliability after about a month of use about 1000 photos taken the card ceased functioning while within the camera neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers including the pc card slot on my laptop with a cf adapter the image rescue '' software provided by lexar on the card was of no use either lexar replaced the card which has worked fine ever since however i purchased a second one which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken again the included imagerescue software failed to help it found errors but could not do anything about them but a commercial image recovery tool i purchased was able to read then reformat the card and it has worked reliably since
i purchased the lexar pro cf card for use with my canon eos digital rebel xt 8 mega pixel dslr camera i also have a sandisk cf card which i also use with the dslr of the two cards the lexar is far and away the fastest in recording reading i can take multiple shots at the camera 's highest resolution 8 mega pixels yet never have to wait for the shots to be saved before shooting more there are also no compatibility problems to be fair to the sandisk it 's an older model i purchased a few years ago for a player however i now use it only as a backup to the lexar i plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future
i just purchased the canon and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities plenty of picture room and i plan to purchase a prior to my trip to ireland price wise i did great and the turnaround time was excellent this card was ranked no 1 in two seperate on line test so i was very sold prior to my purchase
if you find that they ups is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up there 's something wrong with your configuration the ups is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer bios to restart the computer this happens only after the ups has sent a shutdown signal to the computer you should not power on the computer until the ups is done with its power up procedure if you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after ac power is back you should set your computer bios to power on when ac power is restored since while the computer is off it does n't know when the power comes back on when the ups cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on
the manufacturer only lists software compatibility with os 9. guess what mac os x works great with 10.3 has built in support just plug it in to a usb port and it 's available in the system preferences pane under energy saver from there you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit this is definitely recommended for smaller or people needing short run time i 'm using it with a powerbook so that i can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers you might want to consider the backups office 650 model instead you get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets 8 total instead of 6 total on this unit
i bought 5 of these for the computers in the house i would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all i need is about 30 seconds of power i noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on to my understanding this unit detects dirty power and when it detects it it will then stop accepting ac power i think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up
i have had this for about 2 years and i travel about 100 days a year by car i have it hooked up to my laptop which is on the passanger seat it has never left me down in fact i would be lost without it literly i tracks where i go anywhere in the us with the existing software nothing else to buy ! ! ! it pinpoints where i am at anytime it 's great if you travel a lot like me via car and have a laptop a very good and logical purchase
i have an earlier version of this program and the antenna it works well in the car with my laptop i did not have the trouble others had with service i ordered their latest version of their topo map program it was scheduled to be shipped in late march 2001. i had an immediate need for the program and called them i talked to a real person who directed me to the right people to write to i asked for a beta version to use until the new version was released in less than a week i received the full version not the beta version you ca n't get better service every one of their products has worked well for me and have installed easily
fast and worth the mone
perhaps the ultimate addition to a good camera i used my camera with a sandisk pro duo the blue one and while most times it was fine when i needed to take pictures in quick succession it let me down the ultra ii is noticably faster you will not regret buying this
ultra ii gives very good speed to make sure your camera is n't waiting on memory
i 've had this product for over a year and use it with my nikon it has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments example blowing beach sand salt water mists and in high heat and bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her canon would buy this brand again
the sandisk 512 mb secure digitial ultra ii sent to me was not the item i ordered i returned the item unopened
it 's the fastest and most realiable sd card i ever used i heard sandisk has released a newer one that 's even faster but this one is all i need i bought two cards to be used with a digital camera nikon and never lost anything
i can only say positive things about this memory card it does a fabulous job for my 7.1 digital camera anyone who is in the market for a fast memory card with lots of storage this is the one i recommend
i have several sandisk products usb compact flash and sd have been purchasing thier flash cards since the early days cards have allways found them to work great and a good value dollar cost for the quality the new ultra ii sd card is my second sd also have a card also sandisk not ultra however these cards work well and keep on going like the duracell bunny ! there are a lot of cheaper cards but not many that compare in performance and quality
there 's a review here where someone takes their computer and analyzes the performance of the card unfortunately most of the time what matters is how the card works with your camera a camera generally does n't move data as fast as a computer and it has to process it first so those tests really only measure how fast you can download the images or other files to your hard drive if that matters to you great for the rest of you especially camera users here 's the real story you need a faster than standard card if you plan to use video it 's also a good idea with high resolution cameras if they are especially fast at processing and writing the images but i just bought a different sd card for 10 after rebate it 's hard to beat that price performance ratio if you 're just storing photographs sure video of the 2 year old nephews is fun a couple times a year but other than that regular speed cards work fine for many uses always buy what 's right for your needs and if the price differences are small go with the faster card there are promotions every week on various memory cards look for one if you have time those can make higher speed cards a good value though the standard speed cards have gotten so inexpensive you may want one as a backup as well
i have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on came up with the solution ! all you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go super easy to take off putting on takes a little more time but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt water etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots it is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used
this is an excellent cd burner i have purchased so many and all of them are great i have no complaints and i feel that this product is of the best quality long lasting and very durable when i build computers for my customers i always purchase this burner
this is my first dvd burner and the first time i used one of amazons merchants i had some concerns about ordering but everything went very smoothly its a good way of purchasing a bargain and i 'm very happy with the sony dvd burner
i had owned an lg burner and from the time i got it it never worked right i must have made 60 or 70 coasters before i decided that it was'nt the media it was the crappy lg brand burner i was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good but as i found out with my lg experience that is not always true my brother has an older model sony burner and although his is slow it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it so i took a chance and purchased the sony that was the best decision i could have made i will never buy another brand burner other that sony brand i have had this burner about 7 or 8 months i am a very heavy burner and i have not made one coaster one thing i loved about my brother 's sony burner is that i could use any brand of media the same thing is true of the i do n't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is this burner loves everything i had looked at the plextor brand but i did'nt want to pay 100.00 and i looked at nec brand liteon benq but i am so happy that i passed on them all and got the sony it burns super fast some people say that it is loud but it 's not loud to me i got my burner from tiger direct for 50.00 my sister 's computer came with a crappy lg brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too so for christmas i am buying her a sony so she can finally burn some movies for my money this is the best burner bar none
this dvd burner has exceeded my expectations additionally the price was right including a rebate offer with my effective price lower than some brands
amazon service was fast drive installed easily and is working well after 3 weeks
the drive works great it was a bit difficult to install in my sony computer as the two faceplates that came with the unit were different than the ones on my computer case seems like sony could pay attention to a bit more standardization on such simple things service from amazon was great as expected
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it

definitely recommend this memory card download time is great
this card is lightning fast i am using it with my canon and works great only drawback is that it is slightly expensive but quality never comes cheap
i recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through amazon it did not have the notch at the bottom as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake so i phoned sandisk and was informed based on the serial number that the card is authentic so apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern
i am happy to have several sandisk products and all of them are excellent
the sandisk is absoultely worth the extra money if you love to take many pictures without worrying about how many pictures are left for you to take it is great to use with if your camera has this feature
this memory card is great great quality and allows my 6 mp camera to take tons of pictures i highly recommend this product
i bought it for my canon is first i tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems then i did the suggested format by canon and it worked the same perfect fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera have n't any problem of corruption i 've been tempted to buy another one
it 's a memory card and it works ! i have never had a problem with any memory card i have owned including this one i was told sandisk was a good brand and so far memory card of theirs i have owned they have all been reliable
this card allows me to store 330 pictures at the highest resolution and the lowest compression if you want less resolution more compression you can store over pictures on this one card the other big advantage is the very fast transfer times to and from my pc
this flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months i used viking 's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response they offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed they gave me an rma to ship it back for a replacement i had a new one within a week no hassle no fees other than the 1.50 to mail it back to them i never expected such great customer service the new drive is working fine so hopefully that was just a bad batch
this usb flash memory drive works exactly as described and i 'm glad i bought it i did n't give it 5 stars because its size makes it a little inconvenient to use my laptop has two usb ports one directly under the other this device is big enough that it prevents connecting a second usb device to the other port at the same time i 've given up on the rebate it 's been nearly 5 months and have not helped
the usb flash frive is super easy to use and and it so small to cary anywhere i use it for presentations and to load other computers that i 'm working with i would recommend it for not only the great price but the size and value
it works sweet it saves my from dragging around my laptop
nice simple design easy to use worked great for me so far
the cheapest option i found at the time but an excelent pen drive small and with a good style
it works great ! i really like it there is one small problem though the lid is really hard to take off ! i 've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little but not much there has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on but is n't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it i appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion
i have this unit and it works great to clean dirty dvds like those bought used from blockbuster or hollywood video often are however it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks i did get one of two 'unplayable ' dvds to work after using the repair function of this unit i 'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large dvd rental store to see if they can repair it if they cant with their machine it is probably a my main complaint is that i ca n't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid i hate to have to pay 8 for stuff i do n't need my collection is now at over 1800 different dvds so i have some experience with cleaning them
i had a dvd that was scratched during shipping one repair kit did nothing to help it i considered using the skip but i never cared for what it did to the disks my church 's media center uses the optifix system so i decided to try it too the scratch was gone and the dvd plays with no problem whatsoever i 'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way some scratches can not be repaired at all i just know that it worked great for me
i 'd had quite a few previously viwed dvds that had scratches as a result my dvd player would freeze this product fixed a couple of dvds for me as far as the haze you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of optrix afterwards i stopped buying dvds new unless i can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin
nice package for the beginning guitarist everything you need to start playing right out of the box guitar is well made and has a nice sound only problem was i had to change the strings as they were tarnished and would not hold their tune good value for the mone
it is a compact flash and it does exactly that so i am happy with it
i use this little device with my apple powerbook to transfer photos taken with canon digital cameras mac os x recognizes the unit with no additional drivers required and it works great much more convenient than attaching the camera itself to the computer every time
i bought this becuase downloading pictures from my digital rebel xt camera took forever and a day to complete using this drive only took about a minute to download 2 gigs of pictures ! you do n't need the cd if you have windows xp
works well with or without software installed good for home use and school or traveling
i have a card reader slot in my computer but i purchased this to keep in my camera bag just in case i want to download to a computer that does n't it works great but my only complaint is that it 's a little bulky other than that it 's a great card reader
this sandisk cf type imagemate usb 2.0 is a neat little device i just pull the compact flash card out of my camera stick it in the imagemate plug the usb cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a transfer or worry about draining the camera 's battery i 'm running xp and did n't need to install a thing i just plugged it into the usb port and xp found and recognized it the only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that i wish it plugged directly into the usb port itself like the simple tech bonzai usb 2.0 card reader though that uses cards instead of cf instead of having to use the separate included usb cable
i spent 10 on a mediagrear keychain cf card reader first that reader is usable but it is hard to pull my cf card out i think that reader 's pins are very likely to damage my cf cards if i insert and pull my cards very frequently then i decide to get this reader with 20 at bestbuy not a very good price and i am very satisfied with the product when you insert your card into the reader it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader just half of the card is inside the reader so i do n't need to pull it very hard when i want to get the card out it comes out smoothly and i no longer worry about damaging my card when i plug the reader into my computer it works immediately no need to install any driver if you do n't need to use that transfer button
from appearances and description this appears to be identical to my no except for the shape of the button this sandisk is an excellent unit compact and reasonably slim with a detachable usb cord it is perfect for carrying in a pocket of your laptop case unlike my dazzle which is fine for a desk top but awkwardly shaped for compact storage the unit is reliable and fast and unlike the or units which use up four letters this unit only uses one letter it supports reading writing deleting and works with either usb 2.0 or usb if you do not care about the button software this unit installs without needing a driver cd at least on win 2000 and xp it simply appears as a removable letter in explorer i did not install the button software because i am not a fan having extra transfer mechanisms and photo organizers on my computer i would rather be in full manual control of how and when things happen and where files are put i think that this is a unit but i downgrade my own unit to 4 stars because of its overzealous packaging and arrogant installation instructions in both the instructions and on a sticky label on the unit which i still have not been able to fully remove it proclaims that you must install the button software before connecting the unit i ignored that warning and the unit worked fine without any installation needed one of the important requirements in a card reader is portability since not everyone takes kindly to your installing software on their computer the card must be able to work just by plugging it into the usb port the sandisk meets this requirement although it proclaims not to this is a good choice for a compactflash
this controller is absolutely phenomenal not only is it wireless but it corrects my only gripe about the microsoft i 'm '' and have fairly large hands i love the layout of the but the arms '' are too short for my hands this leads to pretty nasty cramps in my pinky fingers during long sessions and ends runs in forza and call of duty long before i 'm ready to quit the logitech controller 's arms ca n't honestly be more than a longer than the 's but it makes a world of difference i highly recommend this controller not only for it 's fantastic wireless performance but for actually being comfortable than the another reviewer posted a gripe in regards to the lack of a slot and it 's a valid complaint i found the perfect solution in the logitech wireless headset which can be had here for 20 it works great and it should be noted that microsoft still wants 30 for the standard wired headset which comes with an clip for the boom mic all in all this controller is absolutely the best one you can find for the xbox pair it up with the wireless headset from logitech and you have a completely wireless setup for 50 a pop you honestly ca n't do better for any amount of money
i thought when i up graded to the plasma things could n't get any better i was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top i love this thin
i bought this controller at walmat for around 32.00 worth the money no lag whatsoever buy this controller le
the controller is exactly like the microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to 30 feet away from the and not having a cord in the way the controller works perfect
wireless is the way to go ! when i put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place singular and clean looking this sweet little controller is imo another triumph by logitech ! though a little smaller than the it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance i got mine used and once again put old batteries in it takes 2 even four months later i am just now getting the low battery light flashing still vibrates still responds acurately and the analog sensitivity is better than the wired get it get it get it ! !
i love this controller i have small hands for an adult and the pad fits me well i like the shape better than even the controller s shape i have no problems with delay or drift i have n't used the but the thumbsticks and buttons work great though i 'm not a terribly heavy user this pad works better than either the pelican eclipse or soul that i own my madcatz lynx is better but way too big for my hands i like the feel of the plastic the only thing i would change would be making the thumbsticks a bit shorter and concave on top though i 've never had a problem with grip
great item powered off laptop its fans work quietly to keep laptop cool so you can actually us your lap without fear of overheating your computer an inexpensive solution to preventing costly repairs wish i 'd purchased earlier as i already fried my drive and had to replace them good product targus
arrived on time and in excellant condition it works very well my laptop is much more comfortable to use
i like it it moves the air out the back pretty fast keeps my legs from melting with my hp shooting all the air down now i can actually work in longer stretches because i do n't have to take time to air out my lap
really like the chill pad keeps my laptop cool ! ! does its job and i would recomend it to anyone lizz
i have an older laptop that really gets hot when holding it on my lap bought the chill pad and was surprise how the two little fans work in keeping the heat factor down it would be worth 5 stars if it was adjustable
this technically works well i am finding learning to use it difficult i really wish i had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one ! ! ! ! ! it is a lot smaller than i thought it would be and would be alot easier if it was bigger
i love this tablet it 's just like working with the real thing with out all that mess just got to get used to it i never thought i woulde use the modern art tech but i gave it a chance and i love it
i love this tablet ! i get the functionality of a tablet computer on my little thin sony i almost bought a tablet notebook but it was so heavy i have the best of both worlds now !
before purchasing this wacom i did a lot of research and decided it was probably worth a few extra bucks to get one with a good reputation i have no complaints i ca n't complain about the size because i knew what 4 '' x 5 '' amounted to before i bought it the clicker on the pen takes a little getting used to but what does n't like the title says it 's just what i was hoping for
this is a wonderful item i upgraded my tablet and it is amazing ! i had fast shipment product was in great shape and i love it thanks !
if you do a lot of photo retouching the will give you a lot more control than a mouse the pressure sensitivity is very helpful when you are masking the lighter you press the less dense the mask is it allows you to paint '' in the the absolute mode location of the pointer on the screen is based on exactly where you the pen of the pen takes a little while to get used to and i still seem to have a little trouble with it after switching from the mouse but after a minute or so of using it it comes pretty easily i think it might be a real pain on a larger tablet it 's fun to use too
i was considering purchasing a tablet and wacom was consistantly recommended i was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because i didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line the intuos line i was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong installing a driver was a piece of cake and i began drawing away in minutes it is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs paintshop pro painter photoshop the mouse is pretty useless however and i would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead they seem to wear out though i do press pretty hard other than that its an amazing product
i purchased the elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i do n't have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of and sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
this one was purchased for my pocket pc have been storing files pictures and more important my recordings clearly it 's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam i got it at a really good price !
this is a great buy because i have a lot of space i use the card on my digital camera and i take a lot of pictures without download to the computer i can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until back home it 's a great card at a very good price
the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent
i 'm afraid i do n't know a lot about this technology i went for economy and i am getting very good quality photos i think i would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and i really do n't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow its still faster than my old one so i 'm generally happy hope this is some hel
i bought this memory card for my camera at first i was very dispointed when i only see on my laptop after googled around i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over i 'm able to see full after driver update just make sure you update your first
product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it i am using it in an hp 5 megapixel digital camera it will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound
this adaptor is great especially for the price installation was as easy as it gets right out of the box i had it up and running through a local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes it locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection both frontpage and cliemail ran fine speed is maybe 80 of what i get on my laptop running a 333 mhz celeron and a pc card adaptor just be sure your pda is on the small list of supported devices negatives it 's not the sturdiest looking thing in the world i would n't leave it in the clie when not in use and i sure would n't want to drop it on the floor it does chew through the battery but not any more than the backlight i did a test with my with the backlight set at minimum ie not off entirely and using cliepet 's underclock app to slow it down to 96 mhz this is a good combination of power saving and usability then i got on the net and loaded pages starting from a fully charged battery it ran 55 minutes before the first alarm i was able to get another 20 minutes of intermittent use out of it after that i consider that perfectly acceptable with an extended battery you should easily be able to get 2 to 3 hours of use out of it overall a great for a fraction of the price of a
works like a charm the sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus ! you can get details of the connection connection strength ap name and etc worth every penny
this item gives wireless capability to clie users and it 's the only option if you dont have a wireless integrated handheld it is compatible with the models and the wlan card works great and i recomend this for every clie user who wants to go wireless
i bought this for my digital camera because my other batteries did n't last very long these work great and last for a long time
it tells you what it is doing some communication is better than none
voltage input can be either or which is very important in other countries nickel metal hydride batteries are better than old fashioned rechargables because they do not necessarily have to be totally discharged before recharging charging units are compact and light
gives me charged cells in quick advantage is the world wide voltage capabilit
i bought this to replace original canon batteries that came with my canon this is really good and i am happy with battery life charge time etc the best features i like short charge time compact cas
we recharge batteries all the time with this charger and it does an excellent job all the time
i purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem i use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far highly recommend this product
this worldwide charger is the best that i have ever used i use this mainly for my camera nowadays i do n't even bother to charge frequently but a small drawback would be then can have provide aaa batteries as well in there pack so that we do not buy them individually
great batteries for cameras they charge quickly and it 's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time just in case ''
the charger arrived with in 2 amazon prime i used this battery for my canon a 530 and it works like a charm
i purchased the elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i do n't have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of and sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
this one was purchased for my pocket pc have been storing files pictures and more important my recordings clearly it 's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam i got it at a really good price !
this is a great buy because i have a lot of space i use the card on my digital camera and i take a lot of pictures without download to the computer i can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until back home it 's a great card at a very good price
i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again
the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent
i 'm afraid i do n't know a lot about this technology i went for economy and i am getting very good quality photos i think i would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and i really do n't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow its still faster than my old one so i 'm generally happy hope this is some hel
i bought this memory card for my camera at first i was very dispointed when i only see on my laptop after googled around i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over i 'm able to see full after driver update just make sure you update your first
product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it i am using it in an hp 5 megapixel digital camera it will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound
we had purchased a dvd recorder and within months of continued use we noticed the picture quality was very poor i contacted the place that we had bought it and they suggested we invest in a lens cleaner as we had used the unit heavily over the last months we bought this product and from the time of cleaning it has worked perfectly i will recommend anyone having problems with their dvd to try this first before sending the unit to the repair shop as i was about to do
ca n't see spending tons of money to clean a product that has been out in the market for lots of years it works just fine and cleans just as stated
i got it at very reasonable price approx 4 bucks sells for at retail stores works great and nothing can beat this deal ! ! ! ! only if its free ! ! ha ! ha
it is inexpensive and works my daughters cd maching kept getting error messages popped this in cleand the lens and no longer get error messages what more can you say
i have a sony dvd player from about 4 years ago that was top of the line at the time and would still be good today if functioning recently however it was seriously malfunctioning i would put a dvd in and it would keep spinning but then not recognize it at all it would recognize and play cds but they would skip constantly i decided to give this a chance for 5 to see if i could recover my player i ran it once and it seemed to skip less but would still not recognize dvds i thought maybe if i put it in repeat and run it a few times it might work voila ! ! ! i could n't believe it dvds were recognized and played again so give it a try maybe run it a few times ! ! !
my dvd player was ready to be thrown out until i saw this product on amazon my dvd player would n't even load a dvd it kept saying please check disc '' after loading this disc my dvd player has worked perfectly ever since do n't spent 30 on one of these clean up discs '' this one does the job
hi hey do n't run to the repair shop just yet and do n't kick that to the curb too soon is on the way ! ! ! my dvr was giving me grief not reading or writing to discs properly until i fed it this memorex laser lens cleaner wow it worked like magic ! ! ! it 's been nearly 3 weeks already and not a single error message and it plays and records like the day i purchased it if you own a a memorex laser lens cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop it certainly did in my case ! ! ! just my two cents
i like the use of this product i think it did solve solve the problem my computer drive was facing which was slow reading the cds with the low price its a must for every computer owner to use this
been waiting for the windows version since i saw the product at pma on mac earlier this year used the windows version from the very moment it was available i touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end adjusting brush size is the best bracket keys never cut it for me i think the product does more but just taking advantage of those two items is a huge timesaver and a stress saver if you do touch up work in photoshop all day long this is a must have
the nulooq is an inexpensive and really fun way to fly through images in photoshop when cloning out specks or needing to move throughout an image with lightning speed the function is tremendous ! it 's a programmable tool where you can add photoshop tools and actions to the tooldial for instant access at the mouse location rather than moving to the menu bar all the time this is a great time saver because you can program in redundant tasks to appear on the tool dial to be clicked in a moments notice changing brush size is as simple as turning the tool tuner to the appropriate brush size in real time i highly recommend it to speed and simplify one 's workflow
i bought a nulooq when it first came out for the mac i 've been an illustrator visualization artist for 17 years now i have an imac at home and a pc at my job it takes a little while to break some old habbits but once you do and get used to the nulooq device you 'll never go back ! i love this smart toy ! i got so hooked on it i recently purchased one for my pc here at work if there is anyone out there that thinks it 's just for the mac your wrong ! the pc version is just as good ! it 's become part of my left hand and i still use my wacom tablet all the time also ! to me this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer cross platform bravo to logitech for making another great product ! get one i 'll guarantee you 'll get hooked on it
logitech scored a big plus with this item the important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly the first review is really unfair logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the nulooq on a processor it says so right on the box i 'm using it on a and i feel that i 'm behind a bit with power to review the nulooq on a is ludicrous of course it wo n't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box hook this thing up to your updated mac and you 'll see it shine my workflow has been streamlined and i enjoy the more tedious tasks more than i ever did good job on this one i recommend it highly
i am a photographer whop purchased this for use in photoshop it exceeded my expectations and continues to amaze me daily i now use it for everything from my safari browser and itunes to games it is truly a flexible and fun product that is easy to use with many applications ! it is by far the most innovative product i have ever used and the tooldial software it comes with is awsome !
i bought the nulooq product a few weeks ago with little expectation and actually with some doubts it 'd do anything for me as i 'm a keyboard junkie the product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot but what a surprise just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price the menu thing is cool i do n't use it as much for putting tools but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place i guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around but i do n't seem to use that as much i still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around hey i was skeptical about the product like anyone else but found myself a rare surprise good job logitech
i 've had this product for well over a year now and was using it with my xp machine and am now using it with my apple mac mini works great with both windows and mac os x with no hassles the removable stand is a nice touch as you can pack the reader into a laptop bag or lay it horizontally if you prefer highly recommended
i bought this card reader in 2004 to use with sd cards since then i have moved over to cf cards sandisk ultra ii 's both 1 and 4 gig and it has worked great every time
i have only used this a couple of times but it has worked well and is fater than downloading pictures from the camera
the reader worked as advertised i 'm very pleased with the
this memory card reader worked like a charm for me we 've used both sd and sony memory sticks in it with absolutely no problems
no problem reading and burning on nec the media code is mcc which is highly rated in most media guides online albeit not the best i also burn dvds as slow as i can unless i am in a hurry less chance for errors that way
i am very happy with these they are fast and with very good qualit
i have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters they are burning at in my nec burner that is pretty considering that it is advertised at hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years
no problems with this sandisk i can take about 300 pictures from my nikon camera quality is perfect
shipping was outrageous thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a f'n postage stamp but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than i did for the item could have bought it at walmart for less this way buyer beware i got took
good price what else can one say about a secure digital card
excellent service from amazon best quality in lowest price i am really very happywith amazo
this is an excellent reliable product i bought 2 because of the outstanding sale price
i love this sd card its not slow its pretty good i got it bundle with a sd card too works great with my gps unit
this card works great and is significantly less expensive than it is at local retail stores as a matter of fact i just ordered another one yesterday
this sandisk digital card has been very useful and worked perfectly fine thank you
the card performs exactly the way that i expected it to and i have had zero issues with speed downloading images from the care to my pc
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
overall this is a very good remote it replaced 5 of my remotes which is all except my bose which is rf controlled it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my with no problems my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions are n't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again
easy to use and fairly easy to set up however as stated in most previous reviews i read initial setup may be a bit more challenging for those not comfortable with computer navigation and use wish that macro creation was more detailed for example more detail on steps to create a customized macro to watch a dvd including ejecting and closing the dvd tray pleased with purchase
best remote product i ever purchased i have the older version of the harmony and this newer version is 10 times better lipo battery last for ever and you dont need to worry about it going dead because you charge it to much
this was a breeze to set up just install the software on you computer enter the model numbers of your components for those few items that are n't in the list the 880 can learn from an old remote as a very nice bonus if you do n't have the old remote the software will try to pick a device example you have an rca tv model xyz if model xyz is n't in the list it might suggest zxy and that suggestion should work i liked how i could create a list of favorite channels and how i could upload icons for those channels to the remote so that it shows the icon instead of the number or better yet open the icon in paint and in the icon put the number the channel number right the icon it looks good and works great ! i love how the database for the ir codes for all the different devices can be added to by the users of the remote i understand that no company could ever hope to have all of the ir codes for all devices ever made to think that a company could do that would be insane logitech realized there is power in numbers let the end users help to improve things it also allows you to leave any components on permanently for example my tivo box i do n't want that to turn off it can be turned off and as a default the harmony 880 will turn it off to save power i prefer it on and making that change was pretty simple you just go into the preferences for the tivo in the harmony software and tell it always leave this device on '' now when you hit the off button on the harmony remote everything else turns off and the harmony 880 leave the tivo on my only complaints are these items the buttons to the left and right of the screen are a little tough to push i personally think they should have been a little easier to activate also i would have liked to have had the pause button a little more centered and more separated from the other buttons that way it would have been easier to pause a tv tape and last but not least the media and device buttons should have been separated more from the left and right arrows that are just above those buttons it 's a little tough to hit them without thinking about what you are doing given to have made the improvements i have just said would require adding a little width to the remote but the trade off would have been for the better all in all i suggest the remote for anyone who has a number of components for their home theater it works wonders it might just be that i am a little to picky on my technology
easiest remote to program has tremendous ability to tweek will keep recommending to all my customers
i was a bit skeptical about this purchase although i previously owned one of the first harmony remotes in days and was very pleased with it some of the reviews were a bit particularly about the 890 with its rf option so i went for the 880 and i am glad i did despite comments from others the programming was superb all my components were already in the database certainly i was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package in any event the process was hassle free and i now have a fully integrated control for my replay tv cable box tv receiver dvd and vcr just as i had hoped for the control process is seamless and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of ir commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great the fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit my only slight critique is that the remote does not have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off however the help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again the rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too i have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base overall i thoroughly recommend the 880
if you have basic pc skills this remote is for you with its usb connection you can basically make any button you want anywhere you want it the small lcd screen is very easy to set up and you if your to lazy to customize your remote me it also has a learning port the learning port is as easy as pointing your old remote at your new one my favorite feature is turning everything on the button play dvd '' turns on the dvd player suround sound and tv additionally it sets the inputs to the proper settings so your dont have to pres the only problem that i have with this remote is the recharge base it sits on it so light that sometimes it gets bumbed and gives off a beep all in all this is probably the best remote ive ever had
great remote does evertying i hoped and dreamed the only downside was the logitech went to great lenths to make the set up as simple as possible unfortunatly that made the fine tuning of the remote a long process navigating a large number of learning steps in the end i am very happy with the product and would suggest it to anyone just put aside some time to get it to work exactly how you wish
i had an ipod for about a year and had a lot of problems with it having to get it replaced twice before my warranty expired after the third time i sold it to a friend and invested in the iaudio instead this is a great product as it can record sound play movies radio and play tons of file formats i highly reccomend this product especially over the ipod they are crap compared to this the only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts files songs from itunes if you purchase music from them as the iaudio ca n't read or it 's easy enough to get a converter just might cost you a little more money outstanding use of my money though up
i bought this player in december 2005 since then this beautiful piece of technology has been working extremely well i have no complaint about it because i 'm extremely dependent of this player so that means that i use it around 5 hours in my days off and 2 hours in a regular example of how durable this player is because i like to exercise running with the music as my main therefore with the really hard to find function in portable hard drives the iaudio is one the most functional pmp on the market about the sound is just incredible clear with the right unique complaint is about the with wmp so i 'm still waiting the right firmware as a conclusion cowon almost has my complete faith in their products
when i started looking for an player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level the ipod was a consideration as was another top rated sony player however i did n't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console i thought i would try something new if you asked ten people who cowon was i would say probably nine of the ten could n't tell you it is very sturdy and has the same general as the ipod clearly designed to compete with apple the iaudio has some very valuable aspects sound quality especially from something that weighs under 8 oz i am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable all metal construction and overall great feel design and intuitive i found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes converts from the ipod may take some getting used to plethera of options bass surround sound pan wallpaper 5 band equalizer fm radio voice recorder surround sound and mp enhance ability to play video 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time powerful i normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it about the same as equal or lesser players easy program to use for transferring any type of file to the iaudio it is a drag and drop system it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music you need is included in the box earphones usb 2.0 transfer cable another cable a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player charger and jetshell software storage space 20 gb which can be used to store much more than there are some negative attributes to the iaudio however most glaring problem i had was with the headphones they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable they also have an assymetrical length cord i consider myself to have average size ear canals so i imagine this is a major problem for other users i suggest cowon completely redesigns these the brand is widely unknown the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews place online to buy particulary for this player however i read somewhere that there would soon be one just like itunes this being my first player i am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price because i would rather pay more for the quality the iaudio is an all around outstanding media player and i believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out if i were to rate everything that came in the box i would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones other than that this player is close to perfect
after doing a fair amount of internet research about players and their features i was under the impression that i would go with an ipod having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years i have never been fond of the mac and have always been a little biased towards pc 's this added to my reticence to own a mac product and the growing complaints about service on the ipod being a 'bit ' over priced i forged on i started reading through all of the reviews i could find on the internet and as always found a wealth of them here on amazon to my dismay all the reviews i could find on product names i knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely thats is until i got to the iaudio line the reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things i could easily overlook i love the control i am big guy with big hands and i have rarely if ever pushed the control and not had the result i was intending i have had my iaudio for over a month and i have nothing bad to say in the least i am an avid linux user and it works flawlessly with linux the sound quality is phenomenal except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those the fm tuner is great you wont get that on an ipod i travel a lot and i pipe my through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port what else can i say this is a great product with great features and it looks good too ! i also bought a case from zcover which fits the purpose but i think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market a satisfied custome
i am not going to rehash what the other comments have said most that mention pros and cons are accurate here is my addition joystick is not as good as the ipod on the other hand the ipod was designed by apple and therefore needs extra software to use it with a pc i have not even installed any software to use my iaudio ! i use it as a hard drive player and sometimes i record radio shows to listen to later i got the for extra storage the iaudio seems to be quality made and does n't scratch as bad as my son 's ipod i would buy this product if i had to do it all over again !
this is the second keyboard i 've purchased not because the first one broke because it 's such a great keyboard now i keep one at home and take one with me when i go lanning the only issue with the keyboard is the lcd is pretty useless is fast paced fps games otherwise it 's good for keeping the clock up so one does n't lose track of the time
i bought this a few months back and i use it mostly for playing wow pros very high quality product strong enough to endure long combat sessions the lcd is very useful if like me you enjoy playing your own music while you play a game because it allows me to control itunes whithout out of the game macro keys open up a huge array of possibilites and they are particularly helpful if you can arrange your action buttons to duplicate their positioning on your keyboard i use flexbar with wow cons the software needs a bit of improvement if i put my computer to hybernate the software seems to hang when i bring it back up and i ca n't use the macro keys so i have to reboot or kill the software 's process and restart it manually the interface used to configure the macro keys lacks a bit of usability it forces me to use the mouse a lot and i like being able to use the keyboard even though the lcd offers other posibilities like displaying available ammo i do n't use most of them because i can get most of these values from my game 's ui and i dont have to look away from the monitor to do so overall a very good product if you enjoy keyboard based computer gaming would n't go back to a regular keyboard for gaming
overall this keyboard is great here are what i like about it 1. i can fly on this key due to it 's relatively soft keys i think there are softer keyboards less resistance when pressing down god i miss my spar station keyboard but ca n't use it with a pc 2. lcd screen has huge growth potential for other info display 3. lighted keys this can be a bad thing too 4. programmable keys lots of them ! can be a headache to remember them too the flaws 1. the lighted keys uses a bright blue color even at the dimmest setting it 's still not good here 's some physics for the designers the human eye does n't sense blue well in the dark and thus the pupil stays wide open and the blue lights can be seen as a bad glare same effect of having one of those expensive hid xeon headlights beaming at you so why is this a problem on a keyboard well you would most likely use it in the dark with the key lights on however your peripheral vision will have this blinding glare it could make some people dizzy or have some optical illusion that 's not going to sit well with your eye 's scan rate suggestion for the designer use other less intrusive color for the led possibly red orange green hell make them selectable ! blue would not be my first choice 2. the usb plugs on this keyboard does n't support my usb 2.0 flash drive bad ! ! ! ! if you are going to provide an usb port do it right ! 3. the black soft rubber surface on the edge and lcd back cover is a dust magnet they provide some good traction when you grab them but they also grab dust like nothing else so you 'll endup with an impossible to clean black surface lesson learned do n't eat snacks near the keyboard or your keyboard will end up with lots of nice snacks for the dog to lick SMILE ok duck tape would fix that but i 'm lazy ! other than that it 's a solid keyboard
i 've had the logitech for several months now and it has many features which i use regularly the paint does n't seem to wear off even if i rub or scratch at the keys installation was somewhat time consuming because the keyboard has drivers for each part rather than one driver for the entire thing lights look great screen is easily readable third party lcd apps are highly customizable i can use chat on trillian and access my buddy list with the screen keystrokes go directly to the screen when you hit the button for reply then i can send it by hitting enter i can view a winamp visualization and song title view my playlist change various volume controls and use standard playback functions i can view network activity macros are easy to program the key feel is awesome compared to my old keyboard they have a nice solid click to them but the pressure necessary and the keystroke length are both small included lcd apps are terrible and useless to me long setup more than you 'll ever use minimal game support lcd apps take up valuable ram although not much keyboard profiler takes up ram and must run to maintain full functionality invisible lettering when the lights are off light brightness levels are pointless the options are n't see it ! but dim more visible but still dim usb ports are usb 1.1 gaming mode switch '' i never hit the windows key while gaming even though i usually use ctrl and alt frequently i think you 'd really have to be fumbling with the keys to need that feature the wrist rest is flimsy the default lcd setting is to cycle through the apps which i hate and if i do n't shut down properly the lcd profiler resets all its settings to default the included checker does n't have ssl you need to get some ridiculous add on which sucks up more resources the mail checker the ssl thing ends up being a little too resource heavy for me to appreciate in other words its a big pain to get gmail working with the included checker if you play a lot of world of warcraft or really like to tweak your settings and streamline your interface you might enjoy having all the macros the screen is more useful for purposes so do n't buy it with intent to improve your experience since the lcd does n't display anything for anyway there are many party lcd apps out there and you can probably find one that will make you love the screen be warned unless you use the party apps you probably will be disappointed with the lcd 's functionality bottom recently the priced spiked up for these keyboards i would n't pay the new higher price for one this is n't the kind of item i would say that i ca n't live without its mainly a luxury and unless you 're a serious computer geek like myself you probably wo n't even know how to utilize the more advanced features the hardware is solid and powerful if you know how to use it the included software cd ended up in my trash can
this fashionable keyboard does spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared to the typical keyboard the lcd screen is a nice feature toy but i find myself rarely using it as most apps and games do n't support it the two usb ports are very handy and would be especially so for anyone without frontside usb on their towers it is worth buying for anyone in that situation the blue lighting on the keys do make them easier to read in a dim room but does n't help much in a truly dark room the macro keys are plentiful and easy to use well worth the buy for anyone wanting something that looks nicer then the typical keyboard anyone needing easy access to usb ports and for anyone needing macro keys people may also want to give the new vista keyboard from microsoft a look
we bought this tv 3 months ago and do n't regret it one bit it was delivered right to our door in a timely manner and in perfect condition we do not have satellite or cable only reg antenna and were very pleased to find that we get so many more channels now and much much clearer reception now that we are picking up the digital '' signals again we love it and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to move up to hd
i searched far and wide and compared many tv 's it came down to the panasonic plasma tv the sony i went with the sony due to price but i 'm glad i did i ca n't see putting in a tv i am really pleased with the sony particularly the price i paid it was so much cheaper here at than at the big box retail stores
i purchased this television at a store on sale for less money than the 32 '' lcd screen that i was considering i was planning to place the tv on a stand not the wall and i do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the tv for comparison i am moving from a 26 '' crt hdtv to this unit the size difference is amazing but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate what surprised me is that even on or broadcasts the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous crt i 'm honestly not sure if it 's because of the size difference again larger more detail shows or because of the tv itself but it 's great my only real complaint is that i can not access an guide using the tv as the cablecard technology is only at this point however i will not penalize the tv 's rating because the cablecard technology is immature that 's not this tv 's fault i for one actually like the thought of changing a bulb every months in my tv remember the phosphor in crts and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years and that ca n't be replaced the backlight in standard lcd screens will lose brightness and go out over time and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace however this tv only has one component for which failure is expected the bulb which i can replace myself in five minutes for 200 my last pro '' is the tv 's weight i moved my old crt off of the tv stand and almost killed my back doing so i was able to lift this tv into place with almost no effort the entire unit weighs about pounds and the weight is in all the right places even though it 's light enough to lift with ease sony included one final touch that i am thankful for rubber feet i can scoot this tv on my stand without scratching the wood surface and when trying to center a tv which is nearly 40 '' wide across the front that 's a good thing
my new tv finally arrived and i am very pleased with it i picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews i could find online the vast majority of which were very positive cnet has lots of reviews as well also i have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of tvs all day every day and both of them bought this exact set for themselves my cable provider does not offer many high def stations yet so the image quality of standard def video was the primary criterion for me most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite my first impression had me rather worried i have since come to believe that poor quality standard def video is just a matter of garbage in garbage out i began to suspect this when i noticed that some stations looked much better than others in fact some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them i became convinced as i watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time the video of the host looked ok the video of one contributor was poor and the video of the other contributor looked great the video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen the set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic standard def video i expect that i just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser tvs the quality of the hi def video is breath taking was simple and i have not even bothered yet to read the manual of course the display can be adjusted in many ways but it looks good to me with the factory presets and i do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon flipping through the on screen menu i stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since i live at above sea level i was a little disappointed with the delivery situation i thought i had ordered the tv in time to have it by opening day instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season and i was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that i blame the shipper eagle usa for this not amazon i say this because i could track the package enough to know that amazon had the tv picked up right away but then eagle usa kept it sitting in dallas for almost 2 weeks and then in denver for another week before finally calling me to arrange for delivery i believe that if i had not called and emailed amazon to complain about the delay it would have taken longer eagle usa told amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but i know that this is not true for two reasons 1 i had called eagle usa the same day they told amazon this and eagle usa told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery and 2 my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and i have a very good message and caller id tracking system in place all in all a great set at a great price i just wish i had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner
i got mine locally for 1100 dollars the going rate was i saw it at a competitor for 1198 so i went to another competitor and they gave it to me for the same price and took another 100 off the price for hdtv installation what a picture i started to get turned off by sony because i had 2 32 inch crt 's with tilted yoke making widescreen movies bend at the corners but i remained loyal and i 'm glad i did i was iniitally wanting a dlp by samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away i did n't go for the 500 dollar service contract because that 's half of the price of the television i 'll take my chances on this one hopefully bulbs will come down too you 'll love the picture with or without hdtv i love all the features and they 're pretty intuitive there probably wo n't be too many left i think they 're phasing the model out not sure about amazon but the sony purchase is worth it sorry about the other bad reviews here
i bought this tv in march of this year 2006 and it has worked perfectly until the sony techs came out and updated '' my firmware i was not having any problems with the tv but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty as soon as the tech left and i turned on the tv the fan is running on high '' and is loud this did not happen until the software was updated i went into the functions and tried to use the high alt function to turn the fan to low off but that would work the good news is i bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed or replaced word of caution you may consider not updating the firmware if the tv is working and buy the extended warranty i paid 300 for 4 years and figure i 'll get at least one 250 bulb out of the deal yes it is covered otherwise the tv is perfect
brilliant images highest quality you simply can not beat this system for the price also this particular projection tv handles the channels very well not all hdtv models do this the fact is that most channels are not available in hdtv yet so it 's nice to have a high quality tv that can deliver channels to you in a high quality rendering this tv does that very well yes it 's nothing like hdtv but all the same they do a fine job with this model
i was a little tentative to order the itrip lcd because of some of the bad reviews i read it seems like there are very few people sitting on the fence with this item buyers either love it or hate it i was leaving for a trip and hoped the itrip would arrive so i could use it on my drive as luck would have it it was in my mailbox the day before i left i unwrapped it and went out to the vehicle to test it i plugged it into my ipod photo and right off the bat thought i had trouble it would n't power up i tried plugging and unplugging cleaning the contacts and finally as a last resort read the instructions after plugging it in you have to play the song before it will power on this immediately explains why so many poeple complain of doas right out of the box i set the frequency to the lowest available on the fm band and presto ! ! ! instant music i do n't live in an extremely populated area so i ca n't really comment on other stations bleeding through but loud passages are loud and quiet passages are quiet many reviewers complained of bad sound quality but you must remember this it does n't matter how great the quality of the song is on your ipod you are playing it over fm radio so it will never sound better than fm radio i inherited my father 's accord work car when he retired and it has a bare bones radio with a tone control bass and treble all rolled into one handy knob ! ! ! and cheap 6 inch speakers in the front doors when i drive i like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and occasionally music the sound quality was exactly what i expected no better and no worse i also tested it in my wife 's focus it has a nice factory 6 speaker cd system and the sound from the ipod was just fine the bass still thumped and the highs seemed just a tiny bit off but still not bad at all i am completely satisfied with the product one strange thing that i noticed that may explain why some people complain of bad sound quality is if you tap on the itrip the sound comes through your speakers much like tapping on a microphone if you were to lay it on a hard surface in your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road unless there was a defective batch sent out i do n't know where all of the complaints come from i got mine for 15 from a private seller on amazon and consider it a great purchase especially for that amount of money do n't hesitate to buy one it works as advertised and the sound quality is what it is if you keep these things in mind you wo n't be disappointed
it was not what i was expecting but still ok probably quality still all right for the price but if u want something with quality do not buy this
some people seem to have had issues but i loved mine i live in the boston area and the itrip always worked fine in the range not fantastic sound but more than adequate the portability is a huge plus as well i used it for playing my ipod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling radios at friends ' houses on and on the itrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable i have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently for the price and the convenience you ca n't beat this thing the only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of ipods
so i was a little weary to buy an itrip after hearing some mixed reviews it seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs or the itrip worked perfectly knowing my luck it would n't work for me at all i recieved my itrip and my luck started right away i tossed the itrip onto my ipod and nothing a bad omen well after i exchanged my itrip for a new one i tried it out on a short drive i live in east lansing mi and we have a very crowded fm dial i could n't find a completely blank station as recommended but it did n't matter my itrip delivered decent sound through the station as others have mentioned charging your ipod while you use your fm transmitter will really help it 's not a difference but it 's a noticeable improvement sure i got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal but you know what through a good 40 minutes of driving the majority of the time i had satisfactory sound this was also on the lx mode not dx supposedly dx provides a better stronger signal this product is dependant on several outside factors the reception your car gets and the availability of a clear fm channel to rate this product poorly because of factors out of it 's control is unfair there were times when i had downright poor sound and times where it was comparable to a tape deck i love good crisp sound as much as anyone does but i 'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday my recommendation after owning this product for a short time it has been used quite a bit already as i do a lot of i say if you can buy a tape deck adaptor but if it 's not an option and you do n't want to put the money into an ipod to car '' setup this is a viable solution indeed in my opinion an itrip is a better option than listening to plain old radio
it 's goo
i 've used this to burn about 3 cds and my husband has done a couple as well we have n't had any problem so far
it was a little complicated to install but i 'm not very technical but it is very easy to use i have been happy with it
i bought this about 7 months ago and never had a problem with it it take 7 minutes to burn an 80 minute cd the program reminds you to close any other open programs before burning a disc very easy to use i brun cd 's every single day it is my baby ! !
it is an excellent product easy to install really powerful the only minus is the burner software if you have or you can purchase nero or cdrwin then you can obtain the maximum performance from this unit
i bought this dream system '' to compliment my samsung 50 '' hdtv dlp television if looks could kill these two products together win hands down overall i am pleased with the system for the amount of money i invested for it sound is decent i feel it is diffidently a great acoustic system but if you are looking for the bass invest in a wired system with monster cables as like many others thoughts i was attempting to overcome an apartment predicament and wireless '' seemed to be the answer problem is the two rear speakers still need to be connected to each other via none other then a wire so if you are looking for a truly wireless gig continue to hold your breath because sony has figured out how to eliminate point a to point b but point b to point c remain dreamless
this is a great piece of hardware the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me but in my apartment i would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker it 's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself the bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default the other thing is that i would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer that 's not going to happen with this system you ca n't change that easily and yes the 5 disk changer is slow the maximum volume setting does n't seem that loud to me but then i have the decibal settings at default all the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here it has all the flavors hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way i 'd like it too but i only tried rca and not the digital i have a sony 32 '' wega and i had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the reciever that works like a charm even with 5.1 sound from xbox one huge complaint i have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best i see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my tv there is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual ! beware ! four stars
this product is awesome course it 's a sony SMILE what else can i say
i started searching for wireless surround speakers due to the configuration of my apartment a wired solution simply would not work due to the location of my couch and the distance from my tv after searching for a while there were only a couple options available the sony a system by panasonic that had an optional wireless option and a wireless receiver kit made by kenwood after looking at reviews of all of the different options the sony appeared like the best choice i 'm very happy with that decision dvds look great on my hdtv with the upscaling feature be forewarned if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive hdmi cable and your tv will need to be support it i bought a belkin cable instead of monster and it was still over 100 dvds also sound terrific the surround is impressive for a wireless solution like any stereo it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker and i pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel the subwoofer as others have stated is pretty powerful for a passive speaker there could be more depth to the sound however it is an out of the box solution and i think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it 's default sound level others have complained that cds do n't sound good i disagree i 've played several cds and i think they sound great i also input my ipod through the audio inputs and that sounds pretty great too again like any receive you 'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking overall i 'm very happy with this system
i purchased the sony system over the internet it surprisingly arrived in only a few days assembly and wiring instructions were done well it looks good and matches well with my sony hdtv the sound quality is just fine for movies and tv programs but fair at best for listening to music on cd 's or from the fm tuner and compares to an inexpensive stereo the base is not tight and kind of whoompy although there is plenty of it i actually had to decrease it by 3 db the many sound stages are remarkably different and have a true sense of being there such as the sport '' which does sound like being in a stadium most of the time it is best in auto '' performing in the method the audio was recorded the ir works well but there are still plenty of wires for the rear speakers such as ac power for the amp a wire from the ir receive to the amp and wires from the amp to both rear speakers not as clean as one might imagine from the product description as mentioned in previous reviews the 5 disk changer is very slow and rather tricky to insert a disk until you get the knack a 5 disk change is not necessary as the system would probably be used with dvd 's for watching movies as opposed to inserting multiple cd 's to listen for music i certainly would prefer my stereo for that ! over all i am satisfied with it and recommend it it performs well for what it was intended to reproduce sound from movies and tv again it is a good looking system
well i ended up buying mine on closeout from radio shack for i love mine the sound really is great and the price was awesome ! i use mine for dvd 's my tv 's regular sound for all tv i watch and also as a tuner to listen to the cd 's in surround sound some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers i do n't know if this helps or not but i will i had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and i did not put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit i thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference so if you have that whine make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment mine does not make any noise on standby or skip at all either i am very happy with mine
i have owned this system since march the sound is wonderful definetly a great value for the money the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers are n't used as much as i thought they would be but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money music sounds great dvd is fine for the most part no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time recycling the power corrects the problem it will also plays cd 's that i burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do and unless you are a sound snob this system will work fine for you and if you are a sound snob why are you even considering this one go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one ca n't compar
nice sound i will admitt for the price i get big sound with quality only thing is a humming hissing sound when machine is idle ohtherwise worth it
i puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance the dvd playback is fantastic you really feel the surround sound and the speakers work well it can get pretty loud too the only minor issue i have is when i 'm in tv '' mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low i 've experiemented with all of the modes but ca n't seem to be able to get them up to the volume i would like this is not a problem when playing a dvd or using the radio tuner however set up was extremely easy and a complete '' great system for a great price
this dvd system is sweet the sound system is off the hook its worth your doller
this home theater system is great ! it was fairly easy to setup with detailed instructions once connected the sound is phenomenal and clear highly recommended for the price you pay
the item ordered performs well in what it is supposed to do
great item for homes lacking phone jacks easy to set than trying to hard wire
the ipod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other ipods i 've had one break on me and my new one does n't work on the shuffle '' setting when listening to podcasts what i use my shuffle for on the other hand the ipods do n't do the things i need a shuffle for mainly be really really small and pretty indestructable however i have n't tried out any of the new generation of ipods so they may solve one or both of these difficulties
the shipping was good and the product too thanks to amazon for your commitment best regards hecto
this printer produces prints on postcard paper that look like they came from a photo lab the quality is fantastic and the relatives were in awe i am very very happy with the printer and the canon camera i use it with i now have a portable print studio do not confuse this printer with ink jet printers it uses dye sublimation a completely different printing process the result is something that looks and feels like a glossy photo postcard not a piece of paper you do n't put ink in it so there is no ink to jam your print nozzles since neither exist in this printer you buy the equivalent of ink and paper in kits made from canon for example
this printer was very easy to use just pop in the cartridge paper and plug in the camera the camera has to be a certain type of canon but there is an available computer cable i have not gotten it yet to hook up other cameras the benefit of using a canon camera with this printer is you can travel without a computer and still print out pictures these pictures look beautiful and the colors are true and bright printing could n't be easier and fast i was able to get a print while my 2 year old was frantically trying to pull the plugs press the buttons and all arms and legs struggling it 's fun watching the three colors slide in and out in the three passes the printer makes to process the picture instant gratification
this is very well designed it give you 4 usb port but two on opposite sides this is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides you webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right the cord that plug in from the hub to the computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the hub in all kind of angles it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires it also works great if you jsut want to charge you usb devices on the go it come with a plug in ac adapter so you do n't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices
i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must '' plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
this review pertains specifically to the targus 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub the cord is about 2.5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin
pros small cute comes with a power adaptor i have 6 devices hooked up to it including 2 usb hard drives and it works fine without the adapter a big plus for me most hubs would not work with this setup usb 2.0 1.1 6 devices hooked up 3 low speed and 3 high speed all work very well runs cool cons not sure why but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and ports on the other this is dumb if you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward all ports should be on the back and leds on the front here the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you do n't see them the hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated overall the best hub i 've ever had and i tried many
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue
you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires i keep my cpu under the table only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price
this hub takes care of old power issues i had with smaller unpowered hubs it is handling my pda usb jump drive high capacity external drive and printer and i still have 3 more ports and i have n't had any usb power alerts from my computer since i added this hub it does what it says
lovely my pictures are so nice an like the other cards i had where the pictures came out so blurry i would recommend this card to anyone who needs it thanks rvc n
i have been using this transmitter with my ipod photo for a few days this stuff work flawlessly and the transmission was strong enough i tune the same radio frequency from another car and the sound still clear enough if there was an interference all i have to do just to the empty channel this stuff will overpowering the other channel if available the only drawback for me is once you plug the arm connector to the transmitter it will hard to again it might broke the plastic construction if you are not careful
i tried two different devices before this one and they simply did not work satisfactorily in a big city with a very crowed fm band dlo transpond is excellent i drive through sao paulo brazil which is a huge city with almost 20 million habitants and consequently many fm stations in the dial occasionally i need to switch station but most of the time the same works fine all day long wherever i have to drive mounting was simply i use the extension arm provided to get a handy and firm location in short i am totally satisfied
the dlo transpod works perfectly with no static i was hesitant to purchase this i thought because it works through the radio there would be some interference or static well i was wrong and pleasantly surprised i was so pleased with this product i purchased one for my husband and my sister and two friends bought one too for anyone who has an ipod this is a must have ! another great feature is that the transpod charges your ipod while you are listening to it i have never needed to charge my ipod you can set this up any way you want it in your vehicle it takes up very little space this product is definitely money well spent and i highly recommend it to anyone with an ipod
i bought this tv for college and it fits perfectly in my dorm the picture quality is pretty decent though compared to traditional tv it is not as sharp the audio quality is very good i was able to play final fantasy 12 with this tv and the audio lives well for my expectations no lag while playing my playstation 2 console the only downside is that if you want to switch from av mode back to tv mode you need to press source '' on the remote or the tv 4 times and it 's annoying waiting for it but besides that it 's a very nice budget tv for anyone that wants a tv that can save you some money and space
first i would buy it again if i needed to this 15 '' takes up less space on the kitchen counter speakers are on the bottom second picture and sound are excellent clear i would not buy this item if i wanted a true vesa mount to monitor configuration the stand not the monitor has the screw holes for the vesa wall mount not enough or clear info in the description however it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall if you need counter space then buy something else
i was very surprised at how good the color is on this tv i 've has it for a year and love it and many friends have bought one and liked it as well it 's a great price for a lcd tv
for those who expect true 5.1 dolby surround out of the bose system please look elsewhere this unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area you need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised i bought this system probably a month or two after it came out maybe 4 or 5 years ago and it 's still going strong i owned an apartment and was n't to keen on marring the walls with multiple speakers for a 5.1 system or running a plethora of cable around the living room and mounting every speaker on a stand so this system fit the bill quite nicely did i know i was n't really going to get a spectacular surround sound experience of course i did the big drawback to this system is really the lack of component video i only wish it had component video but it was put out too early and then of course the second version came out and it had component and there i was kicking myself and still kicking myself for those who complain that it does n't play all videos i will say this i have also had issues with it not playing videos what i discovered was that it was n't the dvd 's but the transfers or the video type vcd has issues svcd mostly plays and of course every commercial dvd i have used has always played unless there was something wrong with the dvd itself like it was scrached or had too many fingerprints and such on its surface bottom line is that when i keep my dvd 's clean my bose system is friendly if you 've got bootleg dvd 's do n't expect them to play in your bose dvd they probably wo n't work more to the point they probably should n't work becuase you should n't buy bootlegs anyway
having owned this system now for a couple of years i have had my ups and downs but overall i am pretty happy with it for the price you are getting a system that produces excellent clarity of sound with very small speakers yeah ! on the negative i do n't really understand why they skimp out on the dvd side of i mean my 200 pioneer handles the range of dvd 's much better of greatest concern for me though has been voice voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem it does n't do a very good job consequently it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and dvd 's also just a small note to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud so if you do n't care too much for neighbours that wo n't be a problem overall my music sounds crisp and i love hearing every little noise in my music so i still have a smile on my face
i live in a small home and a large 5 speaker system with plus reciever and player was just too much true the does n't have a lot of the bells and whistels of a lot a less expensive systems but the size ease of assembly and most of all the sound was worth the initial sticker shock
bose 321 is a nice stuff and good for the room the sound is clear and crisp a lot better than a usual mini component no need to set up an elaborate sound system because this will do the and easy to use good quality sound for such a small piece thou a little expensive but no regrets because its a bose im a satisfied customer so far i dont have problems please dont let me have one
this charger is really good value for money this charger shows each battery 's status individually and charges them quickly i did not monitor the time to count the minutes and seconds but it was reasonably fast also refresh feature is best i like the looks and functions of this charger
we used this charger with a dc inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a sony camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges the battery is great
charging indicator actually works great and gave this little gadge quite a space age looking charges battery pretty fast although not like the fastest charger i used but those chargers could make battery over heat constantly the build of the charger however is a little bit on the weak side compare to the one i previously owned generally well worth the money good buy !
you can never ask for more from this product that 's huge runs my discman for weeks i roughly listen 1 hr everyday the digital display is very good and accurate the refresh feature is what makes it different from other similar products now forget about the memory '' bug in your battery given the price it is worth your while
if you are trying to get a good quality charger then sony is made for you pros 1 looks good 2 battery indicator 3 can charge single at a time 4 auto power cut off 5 also works with in europe 6 sleek and light wiegth 7 refresh button works really good to get ur battery back cons 1 its fast but not that fast it also depends on the batteries you are using 2 if started refreshing then will take more time still its good
this is the second wacom tablet i own and the third tablet in general the other wacom is the 9 x 12. which at the time i thought was the greatest and the hyperpen my first tablet for a starving artist well do n't do n't buy it stay away horrid thing save up and get a small wacom with the purchase of my 6 x 11 i realized that it just feels right the size is not so large it becomes unmanageable but big enough to use with my dual 19 inch monitors and with proportional aspect ratio on it does not waste a lot of the tablet area the touch stripes are useful but really not necessary only with it sitting in your lap pushed back from the keyboard does it really offer any usability the 6 x 11 is just about perfect
having the wacom has increased my speed and efficiency in editing pictures it is the best investment i have made lately in my business it saves my wrist from carpal tunnel and other problems related with high mouse useage i can be much more precise on my work in photoshop ! i would recommend this as a tool to add to any photographers must have list ''
this is a great product and company the install was free of problems and the tutorial on the cd got me up to speed in a couple of minutes
it 's a great item i 'm loving it it 's been veru helpful in my scrapbook
the tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad the mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks opening programs is one of them it also has a scroll wheel on the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling i use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with the pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines it fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser the only complaint i have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them the lower one is placed in a spot where when i 'm drawing my finger frequently hits it because of this i simply had to make the button inactive over all i feel that wacom has done a very good job of developing this product i feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price i would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet it is nice to have if you have the desk space i 've heard wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that i own one i believe it
i bought the intuos pen tablet couple weeks ago and i use it almost every day so far so good i do n't expect to have any problems with it i used to have a small wacom graphire and i used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now i own a new one the only advice i can give to you is to keep it clean wipe it out every now and then with a wet cloth jo
this product is wonderful i have had it for about a month and use it with adobe photoshop and corel painter ix and it still amazes me in my research i saw that many people were purchasing the size maybe for price however if you have a widescreen format monitor like myself you will be much happier with the once you are over the short learning curve you will find you even use it over your mouse for regular computer use
i 'm a cow and like most cows i use photoshop heavily all i can say is that i can not believe that i went as long as i did without this tool other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes one thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode i use a 24 '' dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and i was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration wacom definitely did their homework to be honest i found it to not be that useful in max but in photoshop it 's a wmd
ok if you have two monitors side by side or a single format this is the way to go ! i use this tablet with the mac with full functionality and 1024 levels of pressure from the pen to the screen i have used the smaller tablets from wacom and they work very well but this particular product is designed and constructed very well and makes the left right monitor design a breeze to use ! having the assignable expresskeys '' left and or right is really slick for repetitive tasks this model stands '' 10 and '' deep front to back and just under 16 and '' wide take two late model white mac keyboards and set them one behind the other and that is about the footprint this item covers width and depth so you will need some desk space or i have found myself using this item on my lap with the pen quite comfortable ! in any scenario this is by far one of the greatest products you could add to have the flexibility to be creative with whatever application you use thanks wacom
this card is not too fast but good enough for my camera well that means nothing to me i do n't have your camera and i could buy it for other things there are 65 reviews as i 'm writing this and nobody has contributed speed tests not even estimates ! the ones that do n't mention speed at all might not care but those who do should at least give approximate timings the easiest way to do this is by plugging the card into your card reader not your camera or other specific device as the device can be limited in speed then select a bunch of image files or any other files at least couple of hundred mb worth of files and copy them to the card time this divide the total mb amount by the time in seconds and you will get approximate information of this card 's write time ! do the opposite to test the read time this wo n't be 100 exact but if at least 2 or 3 people do this we 'll get a pretty good idea of the card 's speed capabilities
the delivery and the product was good i got what i was expecting
sin mas comentarios me parece un producto de lo mejor lo unico que la supera es la de 4 gb y a pesar que no es de alta velocidad no he tenido problemas para grabar video con mi camara casio
after i purchased this card i have travelled a lot and have taken several pictures it just works perfect with my canon digital camera
so much cheaper than buying a flash player i 've had this and other similar sandisk memory cards for up to two years without a problem have dropped them repeatedly with no loss of data transfer speeds could be quicker for taking photos but overall a great buy especially as it expands the capacity of my treo 650 to five full length movies or cds worth of music i only wish someone would make a practical case that could hold multiple secure digital 're so compact i have to be careful not to misplace them
i bought 2 of these cards and use them in my treo i can fit several movies and tv shows on each card which makes for a quick commute on the or even a nice getaway over
this sd card is pretty good and of course very very cheap maybe the speed is a little bit slow comparing with other sd card but it wo n't cause too much proble
it is very good on memory storage it can keep my photos much more than 800 photos however with pretty big memory my camera is so slow that i have to wait for one miniute before it is ready to take photos
i love my 2 gb sd memory card i use it all the time and have had no problems with it
fabulous product now i can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range happy i purchased this one very trouble free
we really loved the item the size of the flash drive is perfect ! we have a tight spot to insert the driver and this item fits perfect
i like the size the speed on reading and writing is usually just fine but when writing a group of small files it takes ages
my opinion will probably differ from other reviewers this strap works well if you have the extended battery pack installed on the camera as to be expected it is quality and would be handy for those who like to keep their camera in their hand ready for action shots personally i went back to the neck strap because if using the hand strap the camera is tied to your hand and that hand is unusable for much of anything else without putting the camera down if you 're out roaming around the neck strap frees your hands up reducing your fear of dropping the camera eliminates the possibility of setting it down for a second and having it disappear and with the neck strap the camera is readily available i have to give it a 5 star due to the fact that it does exactly what it was designed to do and quality made mark h
alot better then wrapping the neck strap around your arm or hand it really depends on what kind of photography you do i shoot at night clubs and weight can add up i have a canon rebel xt hand grip with 2 batties canon flash and or it feels alot better using the hand strap
i originally bought this for my with the batterygrip and when it arrived found that no instructions on how to safely attach it were included after a bit of googeling i found those in the mkiin manual downloadable from canons web site and it felt pretty secure it certainly helps when you are using larger lenses and its good value for the money i have now upgraded to a mkiin and have moved the strap to that body if you find it hard to use the main dial you have probably tightened the strap too much
i would n't be without this when i first bought the it was my first digital slr and i spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap in the end i settled for using both and would n't have it any other way with the battery grip and hand strap in place i find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold that 's all there is to it that 's what it does and it does it well on the down side and it 's a small and transient down side actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you 'd sort of expect it to be insecure i think the trick security wise is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap if used i also do n't like the attachment to the neck strap i do n't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use i use this on a which typically has a or lens attached you can only use this if you also use the battery grip or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location but since i always use the battery grip i do n't have an issue if canon read this you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price you normally pay close attention to detail and it 's a bit lacking here
i bought htis accessory because i do not fancy pretty much the neckstrap i hate to feel my neck aching after a while due to the weight of my plus battery grip and lens i rather to carry it in my hand instead so i thought this handstrap would give me the extra safety feel i was needing after receiving it i noticed it is only intended to be used with grand cameras '' like the eos 1 series film or digital or to those other series cameras that already have a battery grip attached to them fortunately that 's my case in which i always carry my with its i tell this since a drebel or body does not have a strap eyelet on its base only their compatible battery grip has it so be aware that this nice safe and comfortable accessory could not be attached to your prosumer camera if you do n't have the corresponding bg
i owned the canon eos which i sold to obtain the '' eos mark ii my first model came with this handstrap and i found it to be very very useful and incrediby imporant me being an imagine my dismay and anoyance at discovering that this item which was so useful and imho absolutely necessary as my wonderful handstrap which was included in the previous model had been left out of the newer and so much improved '' version i 've called and emailed canon repeatedly which i strongly suggest do trying to bring attention to this issue which to me is unexpected and a completly unacceptable discrepancy then consider the 30 plus dollars that canon is trying to charge for it and well here i go off to my old fateful amazon to get me one ! ! actually its from adorama and only about 20 bucks instead as for my review of the strap itself if you have n't yet gathered considering the cameras weight and me constantly running up and down dirt hills chasing motocross racers and the like i found it literally indespensible ! highly recomended ! ! bob moxion digital production
this is the best alarm clock i have ever had ! we live in the mountains and the self setting mechanism still worked within 10 minutes two alarms and more features than i ever dreamed of
the other reviews i am reading about this clock do not do it justice i just opened it 20 minutes ago and it 's on my desk already synched with the atomic clock i am very impressed the green led is awesome ! i own a lot of atomic clocks and this is the first led one i 've seen besides the one this thing is solid and it looks like it was made in the 60 's or 70 's when you had heavy quality electronics in a tight package this is worth way more than the selling price
when i received it i read the quick set up and plugged it in and within 5 monutes everything was running the digits on the clock were just the right size that i could see without my glass from accross the room the radio was not high fidelety but satisfactory
tengo ya mucho tiempo utilizando los discos memorex tanto dvd como cd y siempre han resultado ser muy buenos por lo general los compro en el momento en que estan en oferta que en amazon casi siempre asi es los recomiendo ampliamente los que tienen malos comentarios al respecto posiblemente se debio al proceso de quemado programa o quemador
i have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of memorex and so far i have not had any problems they work just fine on my sony dvd burner
memorex 's are the best price keeps dropping and never have a problem
memorex dvd blanks are my second choice and i bought two stacks of these because they had a great deal going on in a perfect world i would have gotten the same deal on stacks of maxell dvd blanks they are the best but you 'll have a hard time finding a deal on them since everyone else knows they are the best
i have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months i have only had 1 burn badly have n't found a dvd player yet that they wo n't play in
i bought this product after reading several reviews here at amazon the setup to configure it to my cable system was a little tricky but once we got passed that it worked like a charm i have only lost one recording on one of my dvds it 's strange how that happened since the dvd was n't in the player at the time but that was almost a year ago and it has n't happened since then this recorder is intuitive and simple to operate the conversion from video to dvd is flawless and the finalization process is easy to understand as well i especially like how you can adjust the recording time mine 's currently set to about four hours i am totally blind and needed a product that was easy for me to operate without sighted assistance this definitely fills the bill ! if you 're looking for a great product at a reasonable price buy this one ! you wo n't be disappointed ! i 've converted almost 50 videos and recorded several tv shows with this recorder ! great buy
this is an excellent machine i bought two of them there are a few things you need to do i have had 100 satisfaction using fujifilm up to i have had success with fujifilm up to also had tremendous success with tdk up to and some other brands may not work one thing learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little go recording 3 or 4 or dvds every day give it a rest between recordings one or two per day is okay definitely give it room to breathe if you stack your machines on top of each other put something in between so they can breathe be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides you definitely need to buy a panasonic dvd player to play back your dvds other brand dvd players may not play your recordings properly one of the greatest things about this machine is that it records they are for many many times and each program can be erased when watched you can even edit the recordings on the cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program only works on the i have over 50 discs panasonic brand they sure take up less space than vcr tapes ! get one or two of these recorders and a panasonic dvd player and got it made ! throw away your vcrs forever ! just remember to baby them
i noticed there are several reviews on various products here but this review is on the panasonic the s is for silver i am not a technological wizard and impatient so my husband set this up for me i 've had it about 5 months now and love it this is on the tv upstairs i bought it because i was having trouble with our old rca dvd recorder unreliable but that 's another review once setup it is complete the unit is very easy to use i read lots of reviews before buying and realized the cons that others had were not of concern to me we do n't have hdtv yet so ratio not important all i needed was something to record things from my tivo unit and a dvr that could record on multiple dvd formats dvd ram featues i like i like the ample space the unit allows for actually typing in the name of the show unlike the rca which only let you have a few characters i really use the flexible recording feature to exactly fit a movie or to fit lots of shows i did have to play around with this feature to figure out how to work it while recording multiple shows on one disk manual was n't useful with that part but i use it all the time the picture is really good even with a 6 hour recording time which i use for my decorating shows the change thumbnail feature is also great it allows you to select what picture displays when you browse through the programs this is a wonderful feature that is important to me esp with decorating shows where i have the thumbnail be a feature of the room that i like after reading some of the reviews here it seems my unit has a lot of cool features which would be great for someone who is into electronics i am a basic girl so i do n't need a lot of bells and whistles i just need it to do what i want without any hassles and without reading a manual my only quibble is that some of the buttons on the remote are kind of small even for my smaller female hands the rca that i put on the tv downstairs is starting to mess up a lot now so i will be purchasing a new unit i 've read reviews on the but since i am happy with this unit i am going to buy another one
i bought this for my folks for christmas it took no time at all to hook up and making dvds was simple everything from recording off the tv to recording movies and shows stored on the dvr to transferring home movies from the original vhs tapes i 'm sure for about 300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders but for under 200 you really ca n't go wrong the only flaw i could find is that the initial hookup according to the book did n't seem quite right after taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online everything went smoothly because of that i 'm still going to give it a full 5 's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life really if you 're new to this technology you 're not going to have any
a good add on to ipod compared to other costly or cheap products the sound is good it is loud enought to fill a medium hall with music the and sleep funtions are good the buttons are not smooth kind of make noise i wish we could forward and skip songs from the base you can dimmer the if not needed recommend it
this item is very nice its practical becuase have a gos size great sound and in only one iten you can have a radio clock and sound for your ipod i recommend i
im probably one of few people on here who has a positive review for this item ! i got this for christmas from my dad i believe he bought it at best buy ive had it for almost ten months and i havent had any problems it still plays the ipod the clock still works the date still works and everything else still works you dont even need to change the time theres a switch on the back that lets you change it from standard time to daylight savings time i dont know why people are complaining about that and the light the light isnt that bright if i encounter problems i will write another review but so far everything is perfect
this product was a corporate gift and the recepient loves the gift i selected this product based on the recommendation of from other reviews the product is easy to use holds nearly 200 songs and great for exercising or use in the car
i searched and searched for the right player to use when i work out and although this one had some bad reviews so did all the others i looked at so i was a little scared but went ahead and bought it and i 'm so happy ! it 's so cute and sounds great ! ! ! very glad that i choose this one
i 've had my sansa the white one with a pink silicone case very cute for about a month now and i could n't be more pleased i 've had several players an archos an iaudio ' and though both had their quirks especially the archos ultimately the problem with both was the same their rechargeable internal batteries wore out and would n't hold a charge anymore in contrast the sansa takes one aaa battery such a simple thing but what a joy i 'll have the player long enough to see if it wears out normally from use ! it comes with a battery and i have n't had to change mine yet radio reception seems rather good it does n't have recording as the iaudio did but i did n't use that very much and have n't missed it has voice recording which i have n't tried mounts right up on winxp without any need for extra software i 've never wanted an ipod because of the nightmarish software required to negotiate with them the sansa 's supplied ear buds sound very good but are a trifle large which is probably why they sound so good to me noticeably larger than ipod ear buds but are a little too large for my ears one more thing i am pleased with the sansa 's interface there are enough buttons to comfortably handle all functions the ' had only a few buttons a tiny display and no manual to speak of and was a little frustrating to use the sansa is much clearer has a very readable display and very straightforward function selection and settings cleverness and simplicity is all well and good in a gadget but take it from someone whose vision is not terribly good if you ca n't see it you ca n't use it i 'm glad i got this one
i recently purchased this item and i am very happy with its performance and quality i use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight
the software provided with the unit worked well i bought another player from another manufacturer that locked up the computer the menus are easy to use and it has a nice feature where you can pause the music and the sansa player will automatically shut off if you do n't hit the play button again my only complaint is the unit eats a lot of it is best to go with rechargables i get about 6 hrs playback time per battery
i 'd say the main strength of this player is it 's easy to memorize easily accessible buttons by the end of the first day i was able to perform all of the player 's features without taking it out of my pocket that being said the only complaint i have is that the equalizer is n't that effective although this could also be a feature of the headphones too they fit comfortably the headphones but the sound quality is only there 's really not that much bass but then what can you expect fron earbuds nevertheless i 'd definately recommend this player to anyone tempted to join the wonderful world of portable bliss
i 've been using neato and the 'mediaface ' software for years i love the ability to calibrate the output so i can create 2 sided cd booklets that line up perfectly ! sure you have to do a little test printing but that 's what gives you the control this is definitely not for the dumb and dumber set if you want software and label materials that are 'designed with your mind in mind ' and do n't want creative control then this is not for you i use it for cd booklets cd labels and jewel case inserts all on glossy paper and folks think the results are professionally done if you do n't want to put in the effort the get something else but if you like the freedom to express your creativity this will give you the room you need
and i 'm still happy ! we initially had to get used to the software and the printer setup and yes you do need some patience during the learning curve of this creative process it 's not the normal daily routine of most people we never encountered any errors when creating the actual labels or printing them we also have not had any problems upon using the labelled cds or dvds we 're happy with the product
i bought this for my laptop and have been very happy with it i love the compact size it 's so easy to store in my laptop bag the performance is great
this usb hub is excellent ! ! its small and compact it actually communicates at usb 2.0 speeds and the best part is that it does n't need a separate power supply just to opperate this hub is designed to get all the power it needs from the usb port overall this is the most well designed hub i 've seen and with it having such a low price tag you ca n't go wrong
i have pluged 3 usb connection hp all in one optical mouse portable usb i have used the product for 1 mounth with no problems the size color are cool
this is a very usefull product performs well and stores easily makes a great addition to my laptop
the one i got in the mail was black very happy about blue did n't exactly go with my laptop setup it is very small and can easily be stored in your laptop case or anywhere else you might want to put it seems very sturdy and the usb cables do not come out easily which is very nice
this little hub is just about everything you could want it to be it 's extremely compact i do n't think it 's physically possible to have a smaller 4 port usb hub at the same time it 's also very solid and feels durable the hub provides plenty of power and charges my ipod a handy led light turns on when the hub is plugged into your computer i have n't done any formal benchmarks but my ipod updates at the same rate as it normally does when connected directly i suppose that the hub does impose a certain bandwidth limit so that you can not have 4 devices transferring at the full usb 2.0 transfer rate at once but that 's to be expected this would be excellent for any laptop user with a dearth of ports or someone who just happens to need to connect a few more devices to their already maxed out system
i have purchased this dvd player to replace an older version of sony dvd player that started to have problems playing dvds especially the scratched ones besides that i wanted to have a capability to play other formats including photo discs i think this was the right choice for the money the dvd player handles every task as expected sony did n't disappoint
the device works perfectly the picture quality is excellent the documentation is adequate and the overall robustness of the machine seems good loading is slower than my old dvd player a toshiba i really like the way i can watch one dvd part way through replace it with another and have the player still remember my place in the other one i also appreciate the hdmi interface but have not upgraded my television to take advantage of it yet in the end i was willing to spend a few extra bucks for a quality player and based on performance so far that 's what i got
this dvd player provides a picture to my 46 '' sony tv with that is very close in quality to hd broadcasts the only way to watch a dvd movie nowadays
using the hdmi output provides a hd quality picture i 'm not sure if more expensive units have a better picture but i doubt it save your money and buy this unit instead of investing in an hd unit that has only a few movies available in the new format
great and easy to use dvd 's look amazing via the hdmi on my sony 50 '' sxrd home entertainment at its best
i have been thrilled with the quality of this player i bought it for the hdmi connection high definition multi media interface the player has performed with everything that i have thrown at it the dts is incredible and i believe this unit is worth every penny do n't settle for a phony buy a sony
if you are looking for quality in video equimpent there is only one brand for me sony the dvd player has slick design great video output we watched the latest star wars episode iii and the pictures were awesame ! strongly recommend
recieved in 2 days paid 116.99 slim lightwieght takes a little time to load but produces a really nice picture hooked up to my yamaha reciever and then on to a samsung lcd hdtv both via hdmi looks to be a quality dvd player with nice finish and again a really nice picture watched the incredibles and madagascar with the kids and everyone was really impressed would definitely recommend also played 's on this player no problems
i just ordered but do not yet have my sony bravia tv and my dish network hd package so what i am watching at the moment is a sharp aquos 26 '' tv i took the sony dvd player out of the box connected the hdmi connections to the player and to my tv turned the player on and put in a digitally mastered retail dvd i did n't even have to open the operating instructions booklet the picture is so incredible that it makes it hard to watch regular tv with my tv dish network receiver i played a musical jpeg slideshow made with memories on tv and burned onto a not only were the 6 megapixel pictures beautiful but the hdmi connection gave me the full quality of the sound even without a surround sound setup i then tried a movie slideshow made with an old version of roxio the player actually improved the look of the little movies taken with an old sony camera these were very grainy as they were not really dvd quality they were over 100 improved when played through the dvd player installation took about 2 minutes because my tv hdmi connection is in an odd place i highly recommend this playe
i bought this ups to help protect my tivo and tv it worked fine out of the box and when i pull the power it keeps my tv and tivo going fine
i 'm not sure what happened with 's apc ups but i have had mine for over 2 years and it has performed flawlessly whenever i 've had an electrical power outage the apc 's software notifies me that it has reverted to battery power and informs when commercial electrical power has been restored i can view the stats for my ups when and how long the last event '' battery power activation occurred and the ups current charge status my has only 6 outlets 3 and 3 surge the current 350 model provides 8 outlets 4 of each while i can replace the internal battery of my when it does die and is unrechargeable i 'll likely buy a new in the near future primarily for the extra 2 outlets
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it

bought this to free up my dvr turn recorded movies into dvd 's etc it works pretty well accurate capture easy to use not crazy about the software that 's included capwiz is ok but limited ulead video studio is clunky and sometime awkward to use although between the two you can do just abou anything you need to it works best if you record the hd version of shows even if you do n't have an hd tv the converted image is much better
vhs to dvd disc is just one easy setup i set mine to record and recode just before i go to sleep when i wake up a finished disc awaits with the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct vhs that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape i have taken many vhs tapes that were never released as dvd and now have the start of a great library editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it the product works well ipod old music videos and movies for a real treat sound is perfect
with my pentium 4 windows xp system this was extremely easy to use and did not present any technical glitches very pleased
i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd only mpeg capture device i have tried that gives a good quality picture any other device i tried only worked converting to avi 's if at all ulead 's software is stable and it 's not a trial version if i use instead of composite video computer locks up but that may be a problem on my end there are 2 different capture methods capwiz and ulead 's video studio sound was a bit behind using capwiz use vs instead would be nice to be able to set bitrate rather than be stuck with variable but now i am just nitpicking
i have lots of analog video tapes from the 80 's and onwards this device works very well in transferring them the video audio are in perfect sync pro very good device very easy to use and install you need a very powerful processor to work it right also as i discovered and mentioned in the manual you must connect this device into the primary usb port i have a hub where i first connected but the light was not coming on and the computer did not recognize the device i opened the computer and made sure that it is connected directly into the usb attached to the motherboard and it worked very well the customer service is responsive but they will not work with you on your specific computer issues cons this device is processor intensive you must have the latest processor running at mhz or above and turn off all other ancillary programs while you are converting i encountered no problems when i followed the above guidelines the minimum requirments listed by the manufacture is probably absolute minimum it is a very good product and very easy to use i love it
this product worked perfectly transferring to the computer and then using the included software to put several home movies on one dvd it also worked perfectly to transfer directly from vhsc tapes to dvd without transferring to computer very simple set up and instructions the quality of the transferred videos was excellent ! you can also clip out parts of video seamlessly if you transfer to computer first very simply with the included software you can do or add just about anything music frames voice etc no problems with the box getting hot or malfunctioning after over 4 hours of continuous use
i tryed to use this on an older 1500 megahz and had a few glitiches during the recording loss of frames then i broke out the wifes new laptop and had no problem at all the s video from my old high 8 video cam came out perfect sound was perfect too the point is you must have the power i do not care what the manufacture put on the box i would have given it 5 stars if the recomended computer requirements matched what i had to use to get the results
it took a lot of searching before i decided to purchase a good printer and this one is a great one the pictures are clear and they print fast i showed them to friends and did n't tell them that i printed them at home and they were very surprised when i told them spend the extra money and get a good printer this printer also include photo ink which is really needed for a clean print make sure you also get the right paper
that said i 'm very happy with this printer other reviews like the one on have faulted the printer for mediocre text printing i ca n't really address that complaint have a laser printer for text and only use the for printing photos and i 'm very very happy with how it performs that function it 's fast i like being able to replace the ink cartridges separately supports exif if your digital camera outputs the encrypted data and the pictures are indistinguishable from those printed conventionally it 's the perfect color printer for my advanced amateur needs
we bought this printer to go with the canon we i must say if you are considering buying it from anyone other than amazon have dealt with amazon for years and they are the best at what they do no one comes printer is so easy to setup not like some of are other are using window xp it went like a lees than 30 minutes i was printing pictures i am still learning all the features but the quality of the pictuers is as good if not better than any and it is fast fast printed 2 pictures in less than 4 minutes i have found that you do need to buy quality used the canon bordless paper first until i ran out then i switched to another brand big the right paper and you to will be amazed
i 've had this printer over a month now i have a fujifilm digital camera the quality of the photos whether or is excellent the definition and sharpness of color are fantastic the creativity potential is outstanding i 'm thrilled with this purchase
i 've had this photo printer a few weeks now i do n't consider myself technically proficient i totally scored despite gross ignorance with this machine you can not go wrong the photo quality is astonishing i 've printed professional quality photos and framed them the results are fantastic for someone who is i had this up and running very quickly
i have the digital camera canon powershot and just purchased this printer set it up last night without any difficulty and the photos i printed were fantastic i am very pleased with this purchase would highly recommend this printer i did use generic photo paper to start out with and it worked just fine i am hoping that in the long run this printer will pay for itself and cut the costs of having pics developed at the store
i 'm measuring first and foremost ease and precision of scanning speed of scanning and ease of installation on the computer are in my mind about the same for both the wizcom quicklink elite and the they differ sufficiently however in the primary question of ease and quality of scanning for the record i bought both at the same time with the intent of keeping the better of the two you can just go ahead and buy the i have had one horrible experience with a pen scanner by siemens the pocket reader '' it was truly useless it scanned so poorly that i just put it aside by the time i though to return it siemens was no longer making it and i could n't get customer service here in the the wizcom quicklink elite is not so bad it 's serviceable i do n't think it lives up to its 95 accuracy guarantee but perhaps meets a 90 threshold measured impressionistically it 's interface is also reasonable and satisfactory however the is even more precise truly approaching 95 moreover if you discount errors in spacing from this accuracy percentage its precision is even higher whereas the wizcom is just as likely to make a content error misread letters the 's errors are more likely to be the absence of a space when there should be one a rare missed space does n't make you puzzle over the text when you come back to it two months later is also lighter and it 's rechargeable so while it 's more expensive in the long run you 'll save on batteries both have comparable dictionaries though wizcom has more built in or for free allows you one free dictionary including bilingual ones wizcom is a only a bit slower on the uptake but significantly more likely to warn you scan too fast '' i 've never had that from and again the precision at any speed is appreciably better with both have comparable pc and pda compatibility capacity
these are the basic clear cd dvd slim jewel cases that you are looking for they are not as easily breakable as other brands they are not recyclable
items were as advertised arrived ahead of schedule and undamaged in short the sort of product and service one should expect from any retailer
for slim jewel cases these are quite impressive their durability is outstanding and actually better than i expected usually i have been using slim cases primarily for data cds these are so convenient and durable i began using these for music cds i like them and continue to use them
these boxes are half the size of regular cases just right not too bulky like the regular ones
two of these jewel cases equal the size of a regular cd case buy them and conserve space there great
got my order quickly and found out that these cases are much better than the ones sold here locally and they were cheaper ! !
i like keeping all my stuff in one place but do n't like cd folders so these slim cases are great i accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack the case did n't break and the cd was fine all in all a great product
i bought this stereo for my daughter 's birthday it 's a great system with really good sound for the size it is easy use and is super thin and can hang on the wall it does n't sit on a shelf easily it tends to fall forward because it 's heavier in front so you should plan on hanging it
i have had this for about a year and it has worked well i specifically bought it to tune into radio so i have not used the cd player and whatever functions it might have pretty light 7 of 10 sound quality can hang on wall detachable speakers good for cost i would recommend and buy for a gift
i recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office the reception on this unit is great bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations the sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in if you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound
we were looking for a compact system and this particular system takes up very little space ! it also has amazing sound
i bought this stereo for my baby 's room i needed something unobtrusive with decent sound and that did n't break the bank this fit the bell just perfectly and just in case you 're wondering this unit is almost exactly the same as the 20 cheaper the only difference is that the can play cds whereas the can not both however will play and the speakers can be mounted directly on the center unit and the whole system can be hung alone or the speakers can be separated however when the speakers are separated they can not be hung on the wall themselves because there is no screw latch on the back of the speakers the speaker cords are long enough for most placements if you decide to have the speakers mounted on the unit then you will pleased to know that there is a special place for the cords to be hidden behind the main unit the only visible cord will be that of the electric plug it plays cds and cds on or cdrw well and the sound was crisp and detailed the remote control is about the size of the ipod nano but a little wider the buttons are rounded but here 's the first deficiency the keys are not backlit until you can memorize the placement of the keys you will not be able to use the remote in the dark there is a blueish backlit display on the center console it displays the track being played or the radio station in tune or in standby mode the time here 's the second deficiency the display can only be read when viewed head on i mounted mine a bit too high on the wall and i ca n't see what 's displayed there is a timer feature and a sleep function all in all this is a good system but even with the caveat that you get what you pay for the designers could 've been a bit more thoughtful in the implementation
positives design and looks good mounted on the wall songs burned on a cd sound loud enough not for parties serves the purpose well deal for the money negatives old cds skip all the new cds i burned worked perfect though turns off when the system is turned of
looks good sounds the dynamic bass boost introduces hiss but makes the sound more bassy 4 stars for looks and price -1 for sound quality
the tablet has been very helpful in my digital drawing classes and in my interior design business for quick sketching it is user friendly sturdily constructed and electronically dependable i prefer the large screen format and this size is very adequate if it should ever have to be replaced i would purchase the same model i highly recommend this particular tablet
overall this product is worth the price overview to begin the footprint of this particular tablet is 17 x 13 so you have to have enough desk or table space to accomodate it the overall finish and quality of the tablet had some issues mainly some rough casting of the clear plastic on the top ergonomically it feels at home placed on the lap with the dimensions making it quite stable the express keys feel solid though i do n't use them as much as the quick keys performance though i am a relative tablet novice i have taken to the intuos 3 better than i have with my sibling 's intuos 1. pressure sensitivity can be adjusted to suit one 's tastes making the tablet itself quite responsive the pen is light but solid i prefer the black felt tip stylus point rather than the standard plastic i have laid a sheet of vellum thick tracing paper over the tablet in order to simulate the sensation of drawing on paper i prefer some resistance the pen reacts the same as if the vellum were n't there the image area allows me to use my shoulder for more fluid movements when i draw and does not feel cumbersome at all however i have not used the tablet mouse it feels rather heavy and does not glide across the frosted plastic plate due to the layer of felt '' underneath the mouse installing the driver software is a snap and the customization menus are easy to understand note the option to switch from portrait to landscape is available in case you 're wondering which i was this tablet has made me more efficient and more productive software used photoshop
whether or not you are a or artist this tablet makes it all the more enjoyable i had an aiptek which died no less than 3 weeks from purchase date this wacom is so much better i love the customisation of it its fantastic ! only one gripe with it and it may be just me but i would love it if you were able to customise the touch strip and buttons to each program just as you can with the stylus throw your mouse away this one 's a keeper
i have been in the computer industry for well over 20 years and i have used just about every graphics tablet there is over that period i recently had a need to get a new one for my own personal use and i got this and it is one nice piece of equipment no batteries no power cords just a short usb cable to the computer and it truly is an aesthetically beautiful piece of work i have no complaints what so ever my mouse works perfectly i am even using it to play golf do n't expect to drop strokes right off the bat it will take a round or two to get used to the swing '' just like any new club '' would however i would not consider using it for any fast action games only smooth steady strokes billiards golf etc in short everything i expected and more i love this table
best ever i can tell my choice for a format was a decision taken based on my traditional arts background since i make oil paintings and traditional lineart drawing for concept arts i use very much wide strokes by a combination with wrist and arm wide motion '' so this tablet is well suited for this task not too much exagerated on size and not too small for the wide movements a wacom tablet would be more restricted to me but for those who like small area usage for drawing and painting this has a digital adjust so you can work with it as a but remember to have space on your desk it 's not a 'mouse pad ' definitively get a 19 '' monitor screen flat it down on the table that 's almost the same space you gon na need by the way for those thinking on something different from wacom tablets do n't think ! wacom is the only one you can trust 100 no doubts i 've tried many if you do n't know wich wacom suits best for you i suggest you go to they have a questionaire there to help you out but it is simple if you are a pro get this or better intuos available that 's the hardcore professional choice if do n't need much pressure sensitivity and make 'lighter ' work go to the graphire and if you are a pro and want something to work with milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get a cintiq this one is top expesive one other application will work perfect with it too like software i use xsi max maya zbrush this one only with a wacom please ! modo and many other applications for composing and editing like combustion and premiere it changes the way you work for a better productivity pen tilt is great with painter '' software what you maybe would take a day to finish you do in seconds literally with a wrist sweep and tilting the pen you can create amazing effects in one second also will reduce the stress on your hand and arm caused by the mouse it will improve your life quality by not harming you like a mouse does when you get to many our on computer besides it has programmable buttons on it and a smart scroll so you may use you mouse only for games after that another important point the usb cable is huge enough so you can work confortably away from your monitor screen with the tablet on your lap if wish so to finish i love my wacom if you buy it you will love it too and give it the accessories so this babe will get happier a travel bag replacement tips nibs kit and for sure if you can or need buy other pen like the art pen and the airbrush so you will make extraordinary artworks hope this helps on your choice best regards ! eduardo janiszewski cg artist and animato
this tablet is just great the only problem is that it 's a little to big when i want the cursor to cross the screen i have to move my entire arm not only my hand maybe inches would be the best size
this is an awesome tablet ! it has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator photoshop and painter the pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse the size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time
i 've been using the for a few months now and i have been very happy with the product 's improvements over the intuous 2 line i love the fact that it is only about an inch thick and fits easily into my lap the intuos 2 was monstrous by comparison the only reason i give it four stars instead of five is because the mouse which should be among the most accurate mice available suffers from awful jitter i am not even touching the mouse and it is jittering up and down about a pixel or two still a very good pen tablet but the mouse part needs work
i 'm a digital media student and freelance multimedia artist and my mom is a retired commercial artist we both bought the tablet after putting up with the aiptek version for a year cons the included mouse does n't have many of the movement control features of a regular mouse i 'd recommend using a normal optical mouse along with the tablet besides you 're not buying this for its mouse pros loads of included software that you 'll actually use perfect compatibility with adobe photoshop 's features a huge discount for adobe photoshop cs is included surface is washable and scratch resistant no batteries required awesome sensitivity at any pressure or angle two pens in one top of pen works as eraser tool in photoshop and above all it 's the industry standard choice all other reviews will agree there 's no better tablet and i stand by that i 've used it with everything from adobe photoshop to adobe illustrator to macromedia flash mx to alias maya questions welcome amazonreviewfortablet jak remove
i purchased this multimedia projector on behalf of a local organization after comparing its specifications with other projectors with similar prices several comparable projectors are available currently and i chose this one because of good experience with its previous model the and slightly better specs our initial experiences with this unit have been completely satisfactory the controls are easy to use the output is bright and sharp for an audience of around 40 people i was disappointed however to discover that it has only one adjustable leg toward the front of the projector that leg is used in tilting the projected image upward but we had to use found materials to level the unit two legs would be better !
excellent image for little money ! i bought the infocus to replace a worn out and broken high end '' crt projector my budget would not allow for a more appropriate replacement while the could never satisfy the true videophile who usually spend anywhere from to dollars on a projector it was never intended to that being said i will say that the infocus when being shown on my stewart 100 '' screen is projecting an impressive image that is pretty close to the unit it replaced ! a true videophile will certainly see the difference but your average person will not with my limited budget i am quite satisfied with the very good image quality dvds are sharp and clear tv is quite satisfactory also if you are looking to enter the big screen front projector market and you do n't want to spend more than a thousand dollars here you go ! but seriously folks even though it works stop shining your projector on a wall get yourselves a screen there are special reflective properties in a screen that a painted wall does n't have to really bring your image to life
bottom line best major purchase i have made since i bought a home with a finished basement ! i got the projector and mounted it on the ceiling in my basement projecting on a wall i expected that i would need to paint the walls white or get a screen but was shocked by the amazing picture quality here are the details 1 comcast cable with hidef box hidef program is so amazing it makes me want to cry sports programing blows the mind away i even enjoy watching boring shows with the wife like the oscars just because i am so amazed at how crystal clear the picture looks you feel like you are there ! regular tv looks surprisingly great too but setting it up right is critical make sure to change the aspect ratio back to native vs when watching channels ensure that the hdtv cable box has the following settings aspect ratio controls regular programming letterbox output type controls high def programming experiment with vs overide controls regular programming i am also using the expensive 99 monster dvi cable to connect to the cable box this is essential to make regular tv look great vs grainy get the dvi to connections wires and adaptors you must budget this into your overall budget or the projecter will not be a great buy see my problem '' section below 2 i purchased the from microsoft for 20 once you buy the cables you can go into the xbox dashboard settings to allow for and most games are in and format the few games in highdef look fantastic ! you can check to see the exact resolution of every game 3 dvd player since the xbox only outputs in i wanted to try the upconversion dvd players i first tried the denon 1910. that did not work when using a dvi cable ! ! ! it might have been because it was refurbished or possibly it was because the infocus is not hdcp compliant i 'm not sure but the 1910 warns against compliant units and infocus says that is so that 's my best guess next i tried the toshiba that worked and i hooked it up using the 99 monster hdmi to dvi cable i 'm not sure if it was worth it because dvd 's look great but not amazing compared to hidef comcast programming the verdict is still out but i have never seen any of the dvd 's like finding nemo that supposedly look much better with progressive scan dvd 's i ca n't tell much difference between when dvd is set to vs hdmi output once again everybody that comes over including the sceptic wife is shocked by our basement they all say its like a theater much bigger and clearer than a regular big screen tv and i do n't even have surround sound yet that 'll be my next big purchase infocus is highly recommended but be sure to check out the problem section below problems 1 my infocus does not have any component inputs that means to get premium quality you must come through the input if you have a dvd cable box and xbox like me it is a real pain to switch the cable in the back especially with a ceiling mount i got myself a step ladder to make it easier the dvi switcher for 4 dvi cables is too expensive almost 400 2 be prepared to spend at least after you get your infocus to purchase dvi cables for the cable box possibly hdmi cables if you buy a progressive scan dvd player as well as adapters to connect your dvi cable to the computer port its definitely worth it but just be prepared in my opinion the progressive dvd player is optional saves you approx 150 but the cables are mandatory 3 no way to turn off unit with remote and yes it is still a little noisy in whisper mode but once the movie starts you ca n't hear it anymore i have it so that after it down i just turn off the entire unit on the wall switch since it is ceiling mounted
the chip is unneaded as long as you use all progressive sources in fact when you input hdtv it uses the same scaler as the and projectors the image quality is great just dont try and watch tv on it you 'll claw your eyes out i ca n't push that enough the projector is awesome as long as you use no interlaced sources
i love these cases the colors are nice the feature is helpful they keep my dvds and cds clean and are great for mailing also not one of mine has ever broken but you do need to open them correctly so as not to destroy them i ca n't imagine any other way one would break unless you stepped on it bent one severely or beat one to death they are made of the same type of plastic in which commercial cds are packaged i always prefer to buy this exact type and brand of case
but i love these cases i have had no problems with them yet they snap closed stay closed and are fairly sturdy granted i do not go throwing them around or anything but for organizing things and keeping the dust off these cases do a good enough job for me
i 've used these and similar cases for years no problems even with the cats occasionally knocking them around and walking on them 1 i 've never had one crack 2 they hold the disc securely but not with so much force that you risk damaging the disc when removing it 3 as long as you open them properly from the front clear side by pulling near the corner s while holding the back colored side they open fine
they are okay for eight or so dollars but they do n't last very long then again i used these for a digital camera so maybe that 's why they get drained so quickly however for the price i still would buy them again
price ca n't be beat i do n't see the difference between this battery and some of the more pricier ones i have two kids under two and these batteries are a life saver
i have used about half of these batterys mostly in clocks and different items around the house but also i used them in the flash for my camera and they held up real good i have a lot of rechargeable batterys but these are better because they last a lot longer often the rechargeable batterys only last for a few months if that long alkaline batteries for me can last for up to a year and longer if amazon went back to free shipping on these then i would buy them up and give them to friends as a gift or a prize i do not know what the shipping is but it may still be worthwhile i just know so far these batteries have held up real good and i would highly recommend them
i bought three boxes of these and have had great success with them i ca n't tell the difference between these and duracell 's or energizers very pleased with my purchase i will buy some more
a ton of batteries for cheap they work great always good to have bulk stock on batteries pleased with how many come in pkg
nothing great do n't expect to have and high drain but if you want a bunch for use in all the kids ' toys clocks alarms good dea
it is pretty cheap stuff i did not expect excellent quality however in my speedlite 420 it works excellently and supposed to provide more than 300 flashes with a focal length average of 70
my daughter uses a cochlear implant that has the option of being powered by 3 aa batteries we have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest we have tried energizer duracell etc she needs to replace them every day and a half since the implant is a high power draining device every extra hour counts these batteries are one of the best values out there
i bought the for two purposes the first is to provide battery backup power for my home computer system on a daily basis the second is to use with my portable generator to provide clean power '' to all of my electronics when the power goes out and i 'm forced to use it the handles both situations very well the provided powerchute software installed without a problem and managed the computer system perfectly when the power went out completing a graceful shutdown when the battery got low apc only provides the most basic version of their software you have the option of buying an upgraded one it does n't have any reporting or testing features but given the size of the i do n't see why you would care this is a ups for workstations and small electronic not servers so i do n't see the need for robust ups software the ups hooks up via a provided usb cable and the setup was very easy the provide about 11 minutes of run time for my system which is comprised of a computer lcd monitor wireless router and dsl modem as for using the ups with the generator i have n't had any problems so far the generator maufacturer recommmends using at least a surge supressor with their product but i figured a ups would be one step better i would definitely recommend this unit
i own 3 compact flash cards by viking and bought them in this order and recently i have never had any problems with any of these cards and have always looked for viking compact flash cards whenever i needed any this card works perfectly with my ipaq pocket pc storing a variety of files from to mpeg video to word excel and maps for my pocket pc gps system i did try a lexar card once and found it did not work with my pocket pc as well as this one as not all the files on it were recognised i will always buy viking compact flash
i 've used viking compactflash cards in digital cameras for years and have had a problem with of them never a glitch every bit has always come through perfectly and i did have a glitch with a cf card of leading brand s '' i do not own this particular viking card but i 've owned and viking cf cards and used them in 3 different canon cameras as far as i know this cf cards uses the same technology as at least the card i use all the time all that said standard viking cf cards are '' write speed about write speed that is slower than many other cf cards that may be an issue for digicams with limited image buffers but i 've never found that to be a problem in digital slrs with large write buffers the camera continues to shoot more photos while the viking card finishes writing to the cf card for the price the vikings have been winners '' in my book a previous reviewer commented about difficulties with viking customer service i have to wonder what the problem was that he experienced with the that let him to call viking 's customer service in the first place was it anything serious or did he just have a question he never said not that the cust svc comments he quoted are excusable if true but they 're so outrageous that they 're a little hard to believe
batteries have quite a long life and recharging takes one hour
for the money this charger is a great deal it charges the batteries fully in a short time and comes with a car charger
works the batteries do get hot by the end of the charging period and it takes about 15 min to let them cool down by themselves i do n't know how long they would last if charged so quick but so far they look fine and the price of similar batteries is cheap this is not an extremely smart '' charger special wave cycle etc but it works
this charger is easy to use and you know when the charge is full and complete it also charges three aaa as well as double aa you can also use the two center charging terminals to charge two 3 aaa or two double aa batteries the price is also good as well as the shipping charge the four 2400 batteries seem to last much longer than the 2000 batteries cwje
i have not had coverage for this apple product however i had a washing machine covered by them the washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off throughout was great and made every effort to fix the machine when the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that i paid for it they did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that i actually had the machine
i like it works nice this mouse is small comfortable on the hands
very easy to use comfortable size i would recommend this product if you do n't need advanced bells and whistles ''
upon buying my notebook computer i immediately purchased this mouse the touch pad on the laptop is sufficient for basic navigation but for heavy use especially web browsing an external mouse is a must the mouse has an usb adapter that clips on the bottom of the mouse for convenient storage when not in use mouse works fine even several feet away from laptop the curved buttons that fit your fingers make using this mouse very comfortable to use for long periods of time i highly recommend this devise for greater laptop productivity enjoyment
a great mouse ! perfect size nice features simply plug it in and it starts working ! seems to be well made to install the battery you have to push in the silver logo button on the back end of the mouse really hard then the casing top pops off however for some reason at least on my hp when this is plugged in the screensaver will not come on if left there i need to unplug it if i 'm gon na be gone for awhile i love this winter blue color i 'm so glad that i chose it i have only had this for a couple months but it works fantastically i just hope it lasts as long for me as some of the other reviewers have said it lasted for them
use this mouse every day for over 2 months i 've never had to reset it and i find it to be very accurate battery life seems to be great as well have n't changed mine yet travels really well with the usb receiver mounting on the bottom of the mouse highly recommended
this little thing works ! the read and write speed are fast i 'm very happy with it
bought this to make use of all the spare sd cards i have around the house it is fantastic it fits in to my laptop 's usb port and all the computers at work the largest card i have used was a 1.0 gb card the speed of the card reader seems to be dependent on the quality on of the sd card
this device is great for carriying around with your camera you can review and share the pictures with any pc with usb available data can also be recorded and easily recovered
this is a super media card perfect for storing and transfering lots of extra pictures
esaki si ta campion un tremendo idea di e sistema pa por load up un potret digital ariba bo pc hopi bon y facil esaki ta pone cu bo por saca bo potret digital y pone ariba bo pc via e systema aki di chip tremendo
the convergence of electronics instead of spending in a memory card and a usb memory separetly you can use them both saving some money and space you also improve the video and picture downloading to any computer or xbox without cables of software installation
its very helpfull when you manage several sd cards its faster and very reliable !
i use it from 6 months with an microsd card and with my old reads and writes so fast and cheap wish it have an neck strap
i use this to read the card from my mobile phone with sd card adapter it works as expected but seems to have higher throughput the flash card than my desktop card reader i bought it on someone else 's recommendation to begin with very satisfied
this is a very good product and you can get it along with any other products on amazon up to 500 free ! participate in this special promotion and get a free 500 amazon gift card at this web site
it came comp with the purchase of a kodak dig camera what can i say it can hold a bunch of pictures i rated it a 4 only because i have nothing to compare it to
we needed an extra card right away and were happy that we paid for the fastest overnight delivery option the card came in time and we used the card extensively on our trip to australia
i am pleased with the card i was not at all pleased with the '' website that promised i could upgrade the size but kept refusing to lrt me
i would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again timely delivery and exactly what i saw on the website
bought this charger through amazon when we lost the charger that came with our canon digital rebel xt this seemed like a good option at a good price and it has proven to be so i actually prefer this to the canon charger which always felt like more of a travel charger to me this one can sit on my desk and i do n't have to get down on floor to get the battery it also includes a car adapter and foreign power adapter nice extras to me this is the right charger to have around the house even if you have the canon charger bring that one on your vacations since it packs up nice and small with the caveat that it 's easy to forget in a hotel or something get an extra battery when you get this charger too so you can always have a charged up battery ready to go
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
lowepro offers consistently products and this sliplock pouch is no exception it is secure and well padded i use it to hold a garmin gps receiver but you could easily use it for a small digital camera or other accessory it is a bit deep for the smallest cameras which might tend to get lost in the bottom of the pouch although you could put additional items like spare batteries underneath to raise them up the main pouch has a design for good security a drawstring closure is covered by the main flap with a velcro seal a front mesh pocket is a good place to store small things like spare aa batteries or in my case an external antenna for the gps a cleverly designed sealed belt loop allows you to easily and securely attach the pouch to your belt or the of a backpack without having to remove your belt two on the sides also give you the options of using it with a shoulder strap note the photo of this pouch has recently been changed and no longer looks like the pouch i reviewed i do n't know whether it is an error in the photo or whether amazon has used the same description for a completely unrelated product note correct photo has been added again
even after reading all the reviews on this product i was still amazed at the sound quality and loudness this little speaker set offers perfect for traveling camping parks etc i would buy it again ! oh also comes with a set of plug adapters to use in other countries and also a pair of nice earbuds
first of all these are good speakers nice design but it has one flaw batteries it eats them up fast if you use batteries instead of the wall plug in it comes with it wont go as loud and if it thinks your playing it to loud it will or something of the sort but it has good sound quality and honeslty when your on the go when do you really need it blasting also they are large enough that you cant put them in large jean pockets sadly but it doesnt weigh much at all and i really like how if i ever my ipod somehow it has a cd player walkman so they wont become useless if i lose the ipod the wall hook up also comes with many different adapters
amazing sound with surprising light and portable i invited a group of friends over and they counld belive the sound coming from this small unit
i was replacing a portable sony devise that i really liked but busted one of the speakers this is a very attractive unit with excellent sound i can even plug in my mini disc player it is very portable with a nice black bag i was very pleased at the sound of this small unit includes earphones an adapter to play other devises besides ipods and universal outlet powers up the ipod while playing also runs on 4 aa batteries ''
i purchased these speakers in order to be able to have some music on an upcoming vacation and boy was i happy the speakers fold up into a very compact size and even come with it 's own case the extra adapter plugs allowed us to it in french polynesia to charge our ipod and since the speakers work with 220 voltage i did not even have to get a converter outside of the hotel room we used batteries for power without any problems most importantly the sound quality is great ! ! !
i am a graduate student in linguistics working with an indigenous language in oaxaca i brought this speaker set to mexico with me this year as a replacement for a bulky panasonic cassette transcriber it worked like a dream instead of using cassettes for transcription we used recorded on an edirol digital recorder instead of a transcriber we used a laptop with windows media player and these altec lansing speakers the sound quality was perfect for transcription and the whole package was lighter and easier to manage than a transcriber in my down time i got to listen to music ca n't beat that
worked great for my ipod unpacked plug in put my ipod in press play and i was good to go using it in a 12 x 12 office at low listening volume and find it to be just fine
this review is a little but i am going to share with you my experiences after burning hundreds of dvds after all many of us are archiving data video we will want to be able to access for decades into the future and currently there are no other reviews for this product on the site i have used just about every type of recordable dvd media available and have concluded fuji offers the best value i recommend you stick with the fuji made in japan this is important since there are multiple manufacturers who make recordable dvds for fuji not uncommon in the industry for the end user the dvds from the different manufacturers all under the fuji name look nearly identical you might want to take the time to google and then download a free utility program named dvd identifier you simply put your recordable dvd into your computer 's dvd writer and dvd identifier will tell you who actually manufactured the dvd many of you might be surprised the brand name on the disc and the actual manufacturer are often different for example the fuji dvds made in japan are made by taiyo yuden one of if not the most reputable manufacturers out there the fuji dvds made in taiwan are made by an entirely different manufacturer both the japan and taiwan fuji dvds look nearly identical in packaging and share a common proof of purchase code however one set will note made in japan under the proof of purchase code and the other set will note made in taiwan under the proof of purchase code the other way to distinguish between the packages is the made in japan dvds will have the plastic spindle cover flush against the black spindle base the made in taiwan dvds will have the black base stick out slightly i have heard some people say digital is digital and all dvds are created equal this is not true you want to buy a dvd that is manufactured with quality you might save a few cents buying a cheaper dvd however you have to factor in bad burns and lost data with the cheapo dvds you will have more coasters and more dvds that initially burn fine but lose the data after a few months in the past two years i have burned over of the made in japan fuji dvds and have only six bad burns and have not yet experienced lost data from any of the hundreds of successful recordings i use these fuji dvds more than any other brand i also use the panasonic also manufactured by taiyo yuden as well as unlabeled dvds from an online wholesaler that are also manufactured by taiyo yuden the fuji dvds have an attractive silver color top the panasonics have an attractive gold color top the panasonic dvds are also much more expensive than the fujis in terms of compatibility i have played the fuji dvds on over 20 different dvd players and have yet to find a player that does not play my video recorded on a fuji dvd the 50 pack fuji spindle regularly goes on sale for 20 at a variety of retailers
like the other reviewer i also have a nec dvd drive i 've tried sony memorex verbatim maxell and tdx discs but none compare to fuji i 've also tried generic ones but was every time i got another unintended frisbee one brand in particular mentioned earlier would not hold '' what i wrote on the disc on the first day the disc was fine go back to it in a month the data is gone ! the others would burn fine but more times than not the quality of the picture would be downgraded the video skiped jumps etc and yes i thought so too but nope it happened on more than 5 dvds i tested thank goodness i found these at the store on sale ! what the heck i 'll give it a try ca n't get much worse i got ta say fuji is all i use now i have n't even gotten 1 coaster and i 'm on my 100 pack ! i archive movie and picture files and the picture quality is as good as the first day i highly recommend these ! spend a little more and get the quality and longevity you 'd expect from writing on your dvds do n't risk seeing your data one day gone the next
i got this for free after rebates when i bought drive last xmas time i started using these very recently 15 days back or so i have burned about 25 dvds so far and all of them came perfect not a single item is wasted etc may be some of the credit goes to nec drive i am very happy with it so i got another 50 pack from local fry 's for about 20.00
it has restored every disc i put into it that includes dvds cds and games it takes exactly 1 minute to restore a disc and it 's much better than the versions what more can i say except buy this pruduct
i had one cd in 2500 training set that would not read the scratches were deep enough to be felt with the finger after running the disc through the skip dr it read just like ne
this is a very good product ! instructions are very clear and easy to follow i was able to repair 6 cds with minor scratches
i 've used this to repair several music cds and a couple of dvds with 100 success it 's easy and fast to use i love it and it 's saved me easily 50 because i have n't had to replace cds or dvds
first off i do n't give 5 's for anything if you expect this remote to be able to duplicate your other remotes based on a predetermined code for the manufacturer of your equipment it wo n't happen it works for some but not all and did n't recognize most of mine correctly however it has the ability through computer hookup to learn all of the functions that any of your remotes have takes some practice and bravado but will work my wife loves it and wo n't let me put the multiple remotes back on the coffee table if you are computer literate this thing is amazing the two downsides are 1 it is heavy you 're not likely to hold it in one hand while lying on the couch and flipping around it pretty much has to sit on a table 2 the keys that appear on the screen can not be renamed so if a key name does n't match one on your remote you 'll have to remember what you programed the key to do
this remote does its job well i had eight remotes to control the gear in my living room and this thing took the place of all of them i no longer lose them in the couch or forget where i put them last and it no longer takes me five minutes to set up just to watch a movie or listen to music macros allow one button press to turn on or off all required equipment and set them to the correct mode the backlight is pleasant i like the audio feedback of button presses and the sheer size of the thing feels good in my hands and prevents misplacement that being said this thing was a royal pain to get working properly right out of the box this may be because i have some less mainstream equipment but the previous reviews do not exaggerate the pc program interface with its endless mouse clicking even the wizard '' has multiple mouse clicks for one simple button which can get very tedious if you have a remote with 40 buttons on it like for a reciever here 's a recommendation skip through the initial wizard as fast as you can then make a new profile and start out in advanced mode even if you go through the wizard most of your time will probably be spent in advanced mode anyway because you have to tweak alot buttons to get them working this may save you much time and headache this is also where you program macros the shining star of this remote software installation is straightforward the interface aside from the points mentioned above is relatively simple you can drag and drop components to pick the order you want them to show up on the screen everything is clearly labelled and easy to read macros are simple too but only after you get the buttons working properly it took me a couple of hours to get it to do all dish network remote commands after manually programming each button for the dvr i had to make a macro to get to my recordings '' with one button press and it took a few tries to get it to do page up and page down when browsing the guide the remote itself has a nice finish and weighs about like a largish paperback book in your hands the touchscreen is large enough to poke at it without worrying about hitting the wrong button the physical buttons are responsive and do not feel cheap or clicky '' after some use fingerprints show up on the touchscreen especially when eating popcorn however the display is bright enough when backlit that they are n't really a distraction the menu tree is easy to learn and get used to as well this remote would get five stars if it were n't for the subpar pc interface and sparse documentation the actual remote is fantastic however and well worth the time and effort it takes to get it up and running just make sure you burn a cd with a copy of your profile once you get it going !
initial setup could be complex for some but considering all it is capable of i 'd say it 's worth the time investment
my husband told me he would like a sony home theater remote control for father 's day as father 's day approached i realized i could n't remember what it was he 'd asked for so i asked him again i was nearly out of time to locate this product but i checked and they had them listed i ordered one and had it shipped quickly but i did n't think it would be in time for him to open on father 's day the package arrived on saturday the day before father 's day and amazon saved the day for me thank you amazon for all that you do ! kathryn
this is a great remote but the software that comes with it is some of the worst i have ever seen published by an international company be sure to download version 1.1 of the software as the remote still ships with it is slightly less painful to use sony rm ax 4000 software update http
i ordered the simpletech cf for my canon digital rebel xt because the price was great and because i had read that simpletech made cards two weeks after placing my order with no word from simpletech and no tracking number i contacted simpletech via the amazon website i got a very prompt response explaining that they never received the order from amazon some technical glitch but to make it up to me they would refund my shipping charges and send the card overnight the card arrived as promised i put it in my camera and nothing i put it in a card reader and got an error i contacted simpletech tech support through their website and got a very prompt response saying that the card was dead and they would gladly replace it they sent me a ups shipping label for the return and a few days later i had a new card the new card works perfectly and although the fates conspired against me i would definitely recommend simpletech to anyone looking for an affordable product their customer service was extremely quick in responding and they replaced the defective card quickly and without hassle
this is a great card to use for your 8 megapixel digital camera i have the olympus and at the camera settings i can get 254 color shots from this card simpletech is my favorite brand because i 've never had any of their cards fail on me even after repeated washings oops this cf card is totally dependable simpletech is pricey but you 're paying for quality which is cheaper in the long run
i had a 512 simpletech card and loved it i got this card a week ago and it has worked great the 512 card was used very heavily for nearly 2 years and so i purchased from simpletech again the card maxs out the meter which suggests how many pictures i have remaining to take unless it is on the highest setting it says i can fit roughly 950 pictures from this camera on the highest settings but i have not been able to take that many yet ! batteries only last for 300 pictures so i probably do n't need a card this big it is nice for videos though and it can hold about minutes of video at it also seems to write very quickly much quicker than my lexar card for most users i would suggest having cards rather than do n't keep all your eggs in 1 basket
excellect price and fast read write works great in my canon digital slr
i purchased this card for a canon digital camera primarily because canon sells this card at their website and because i read somewhere that simpletech makes the cards that come with some canon digital cameras you can read about the card 's specifications elsewhere just let me say that this is my second simpletech card i also have a 256 mb sd card that i use in a hp calculator and both cards work as well as advertised i will definitely buy from simpletech again
the advantage of this surge strip is that there is a 2 outlet phone jack surge protector on board i actually had a modem blow out due to a surge and it came through the telephone line now i use a protector so i do n't have to unplug my phone when a storm is brewing note that most surge protectors baring the kind with huge capacitors can not protect against lightning hits but surges from power problems coming over the lines are common especially in summer and these devices can help
i got this stuff as a gift for a friend of mine he seems to be happy using it so i am giving this a 5 star
i have 4 of these to use with my ipac and also my player which they are full of all my music and are interchangeable with both units
its a great product and so compatibly i tried several places before buying this product and as well all the items i buy amazon is a good place to try their prices are 90 lower what you can find elsewhere
if a disk works and gives me a clear picture and clear sound it is all that i ask for for the size of the disk compared to the price i just do n't know how you could beat this product in my opinion sandisk is one of the best never have had a problem with the sandisk brand
the one gig sd card works better than i thougt it would it is by far the cheapest one i 've ever found and i 'll probably get another one soon fyi i use the card in my nikon digital camera with the pics set to 6 megapixals and using the uncompressed format approx 1.8 meg ea i have 190 pics and 10 short 1 min movies and the card is about 80 percent full that is awesome
it was really cheap the cheapes around also it works fine no complaints but it looks a little weird the packaging and the sticker on the card maybe a nock off since it says made in china but it works none the less
i bought a with my new camera because i was giving my other camera and it 's 256 memory card to my sister the smaller card would fill quickly and i 'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them i paid about 9.00 more for my card in and thought that was a deal now you can get this card for 20.00 that 's a steal for a 1 gb also i like the little case provided to keep the card safe when i take it to the store to develope the pictures love it
i use this storage card in my canon sd 600. get 968 mb of useable space on my camera a card is necessary for people who want to take lots of pictures and not fuss with downloading only complaint that these cards are still a little pricy and hope that it continues to come down in price
the product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what i wanted i have not yet been able to fill up the memory with my camera but will try to soon
working perfect amazing the amount of space in pictures you can have ! ! great product more than enoug
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
these batteries have been awesome my digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100 's of photographs flash recharge is very quick highly recommended
so far i have been very pleased with these batteries my last digital camera had it 's own battery and held a charge for a very long time these batteries have met or surpassed my expectations
i bought these batteries along with the sony worldwide battery charger with 4 aa nimh batteries exellent charger excellent batteries a real money saver
i use them for wireless devices and digital cameras with the sony charger they are excellent much better than the rechargable canon batterie
i bought these for my sony digital camera and i am very pleased with them exact fit into the camera and with great capacity they simply seems to last forever so running out of power is no longer an issue for me the sliding case is a nice touch for storing and transporting your batteries highly recommended
these batteries are far stable and durable in long term use i have owned name and kodak rechargeable batteries they are either unstable voltage output or die out much earlier than their publicized sometimes one in pair die out then other remains not sony i ca n't use them for the digital camera power source because it requires delicate and stable voltage supply those sony batteries seemed not to go down voltage levels and when their charge are drained the pair 2 batteries go down together it 's perfect use for an equipment that needs constant and stable power supply like digital camera
this was the best deal i found on rechargable nihm batteries and that too these are made in japan by sony it has a capacity of i do not think it gets any better than this i would suggest anyone looking out for good nimh batteries to go ahead and buy these
the reason i love this printer is because of its ease of use and that 's due to it 's number one feature tv output i 've had a tendency in the past to neglect photo printing because once i get our pictures onto my computer i want to fiddle with them endlessly to improve '' them before i print them out in the end i never do get around to it now we 'll come home from a day of photo shooting look at our pics on the tv and print out the good ones then i can touch up the photos that need it at my leisure and if i am too lazy to even do that it 's simple enough for someone else to take over meaning it 's much more likely to get done it was great coming back from a hawaiian vacation with my family and printing out pictures that day for them to take home ! this printer does n't get 5 stars because of photo quality cost of goods you can get the printing packs for half a buck per photo but professional printing will cost less the photos from pros will usually look better too while this is a dye sublimation printer it only uses three colors of ink so better inkjets and professional prints will have better colors than this machine based purely on tech specs this one should beat out most of the cheaper inkjets including other stand alone photo printers in the same price range but i have n't seen any comparisons on the plus side the sony does print '' a transparent layer over the picture that 'll keep it from fading for quite a while as for my personal opinion of the printouts as a casual pic taker with a canon i would give them an the colors could be a bit more vibrant but i have also been surprised by just how much they will pop in a good pic ultimately however i feel that the convenience of having everyone sitting on the couch and picking out the photos they want through the television means the minor issue becomes inconsequential because without that convenience those pictures might never see the light of day in any form overall i would recommend this unit to friends who do casual printing and want something that is very simple to use i 've even considered sending one to my mother for christmas while the interface as a whole is perhaps not quite as intuitive to use as an ipod anyone who is n't scared by a cellphone or basic computer use should be able to handle it easily it 's also flexible taking a variety of card formats and providing different options for choosing the pictures you want to print though i would be surprised if you ever used anything but the tv out and ultimately i think that anyone who gets it will be printing more photos than before finally a couple of notes for those who decide to take the plunge do n't count on finding the paper easily i have n't seen it anywhere all of the paper is postcard paper '' i was a bit confused at first looking for normal '' packs the paper has edges on the left and right it 's so you wont get any rough edges but it 's a bit of a pain to tear off without fingerprinting '' or creasing the photo enjoy
i just received my printer tonight and could not wait to try it out i have had a sony digital camera for over two years and have only been able to print pictures via my regular inkjet printer i decided to purchase this photo printer so i could get much clearer better quality pictures i love that this printer allows you to print from a memory stick without having to connect the printer to your computer it could not be easier just insert the memory stick in the printer and you are set to go it was extremely easy to set up and it comes with trial paper and ink i have only used it to print out 6 pictures but thus far i am very happy with my purchase the photo 's are extremely clear they look like i took them to a high quality lab to have them developed
this printer is wonderful and the picture quality is superb and they are so clear i have a cybershot camera and the combination is nice the printer speed was quick too ! i could n't believe how easy it was to connect the printer to the tv and view the pictures that i had stored on my camera and edit the pictures using a remote control i would recommend this printer because of the easy setup quick printing speed and excellent quality of the pictures
it is very small but comfortable to use i do n't have really big hands so i do n't know how a man would feel i hate the touch mouse on the notebook computer so this is great for me it helps me do things much faster
this mouse is great for laptop use on the go it comes with me everyday on the train and on buses on my way to work and still works with no problems after a couple of drops and banging into things my only complaint is the dimensions on this page are way off the mouse is very small for my hands i basically use it with 2 fingers but it works great !
i was surprised how tough these little critters are i got it initially because i did some travelling and needed something small and light my 2 boys 3 and 5 started using it because it fits their hands to play games and i was n't sure how long it was going to last and they can be very rough with it you know little kids when they get excited or frustrated with computer games ! to my surprised its been nearly a year and it is still alive and well and they used it most every day ! i bought my wife one and she loves it and i ended up getting an extra one for myself for travel purposes yes it may be a little small for my hand but not totally uncomfortable and it does its job i even used it through one complete project
when travelling you want it small and light besides you need it to be precise and comfortable all these features come with this handy or fingery ! mouse you wo n't regret it
i 've had it for over a month now and it works as well as i expected it to work i was expecting random quirks here and there as i continued using it but none whatsoever
i 'm a grad student and use a laptop every day at school i got this little mouse at staples over 2 years ago and it is still going strong ! it is very compact and fits easily into my accessory pouch you ca n't go wrong with this one
order this to try and save on money since i didnt need a whole lot of outlets i pluged my computer to it and tv on a full battery it was able to run for about with my 32 ' crt tv and 19 ' lcd monitor comp good enough for me to power down the computer would last longer if the tv was off im sure
i shot several hundred pictures at a wedding with a battery grip and 2 of these batteries and did not have a single problem with power
i 've had a pair of 's for over a year and the sound is great the bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles however it is just right for me i find the midrange and treble to be appropriate i have a pair of grado headphones and a pair of sony headphones each is a 100 conventional set of headphones and yet i actually prefer the sound of the sony earbuds the only problem i have is that the cord is far too short without the extension and far too long with the extension a free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones what were they thinking also the fact that the right ear 's cord is so much longer than the left 's is ridiculous do n't they have a focus group review these things
i 've been using these earbuds for several months now and they 're far better than the ones that come with the ipod they 're more comfortable and there 's so much more bass although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass my pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once and they still sound just as good as the day i got them ! i did have to glue one of the earpieces back together though i thought i 'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet but these things are industrial strength
i was pleased with the price happy with the time of delivery and so far have had no issues with the quality of these headphones the sound quality is good on airplanes when working out and they do not fall out of my ears nor do they cause any discomfort
i am a mild audophile and i love these headphones they have great base response treble and isolation if you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop do n't get get these ! you wo n't be able to hear a thing outside of the music
like i said above i am on my second pair of these the first pair made it over two years of daily 5 mile workouts on an eliptical crosstrainer believe me they held up well considring they got sweat soaked almost every day of their life these phones really bring out the bass beat and are for the money some of the best sounding headphones on the market when this pair wears out i will get some more they are light years ahead of the cheap foam covered earbuds in sound and comfort you do n't even realise you are wearing headphones with these on
these are great earbuds i have alswys used sony dj headphones in the past and these are the first pair of buds i have purchased i am impressed for the money the sound quality is very good full and well rounded with good bass and the treble is not too bright they are pretty comfortable in the ears but it does take a little getting used to the cord is rather thin and very flexible but seems to be sturdy enough for most use the included 'case ' is a little tough to figure out but could be good for keeping them clean in a purse or backpack definitely recommended
i bought this and other sony headphones noice cancelling i travel sometimes because my work and i prefer use the fontopia headphones because they are small and the sound quality is good in addition they isolate the outer noise enough good due to their design the small case is nice and protect them from scratches i recommend this product
i recently purchased an alienware computer with a dell 30 '' monitor and wanted speakers to match i wanted very loud speakers to shake the walls when i play games or watch dvd 's these speakers are the loudest i have tried the shake the walls and house with great sound some important pro '' features i really like the speaker cables are clips rather than rca plug in other words i can use my own speaker cable i need long ones to route the surround speakers to make it a professional installation all wires hidden each speaker volume is adjustable because of my room size i manually turned up the surround speakers volume to balance the sound coming from the front the remote is really cool to adjust volume quickly just point and turn it up
these speakers pump ! they sound great and can be used for almost anything since they accept multiple input sources the subwoofer is huge though make sure you have space for it
the logitech speaker set is one of the best deals around you get all of the features and benefits of a dolby digital decoder true sourround sound and a digital control unit sound is you may find that tweaking the equalizer settings on your media card will greatly improve and balance the sounds output the best part it can play loud too ! cranking it up to its full potential produces deep rich pounding bass without even making the amplifier 's heat sink very hot to the touch ! a best buy !
this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers but these speakers are n't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews i had a bose companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these but they do lack base and loudness but overall i am pretty satisfied with these
these speakers are the best speakers i have ever heard well balanced between power and clarity i recommend logitechs
i am using this system instead of component audio to do with my new hi def tv i ca n't believe the quality of sound that comes out i would have paid what this system cost to buy it in pieces and the sound would be roughly the same i would recommend these for whatever use you have they rock literally
after going through more than ten different manufactures of media i have to say i have had the best results with these close to 100 burn rate with excellent playback on most players except sony though i 'm using a sony burner one batch had some duds at the end of the cake and amazon replaced the whole thing promptly
have n't used any of these yet but i wo n't trust any other brand of dvd than verbatim
my current dvd writer nec i also use memorex media zero i have one gigabyte of ram inside my computer corsair makes the ram
i rarely write reviews but i could not believe what i saw with the 24 dvd '' players and it does n't work all i ever use are verbatim dvd 's and i burn on both a mac and a unit the windows dvd 's play fine in my mac and also i have two sony dvd players a and my roomies zenith dvd player none of which have a problem playing the discs if you truly '' had problems with 24 dvd players i am wondering if you just got a bad disc i have been burning copies of my older dvd 's this weekend alone having done 7 with not a coaster on my 50 pack in under a month and only have had one problem which was my fault anyhow verbatim 's in my opinion are the best media available in both and dvd dl
when i first got my sony dvd burner i had numerous failure with burns i tried several different brands of blanks with the same problem big stacks of failed burns when i called sony to complain they suggested i use verbatim i did and in at least 150 burns i have no failures so naturally i 'm hooked on verbatim it must be the best
i rarely write a review but i figure i should on this one first off the price was perfect for 100 dvd blanks next the quality of the blanks for burning backups of dvds i have worked fantastic although finding the right software to do the deed is tricky at first anyhow i also had to clean house on a 30 gig drive and a laptop so the file transfer worked fine to the dvd 's my only problem was with the shipment itself it came in some square box i opened the box to find some paperbags wrapped around a broken dvd container with the blanks barely hanging on the plastic that incased them was totally shreded and broken go figure ! they need to work on their shipping skills try bubble wrap next time boys and not paper sacks other than that i just needed to burn backups of dvds and get files to dvds so the item itself worked pro i highly recommend i do n't blame verbatim for the shipping issues go for it
thats right not even a single coaster as many others said i did have one but that was 'coz of some other reason there was no problem with these discs i have burnt about 80 of these no probs so far cheer
verbatim is great not a single coaster till now in abt 60 discs i use nero to perfectly complement the burning process i was sceptic when i did geta great deal ar heard from ppl saying these could be from a different production line excellent discs would definitely go for em was always a believer in ritek ridata before these got to get some of those rws
i find the verbatim media blanks to be an excellent are compatible with a large number of computer burners and home dvd recorders that use these you burn your home movies or data files they are there to stay highly recommended and inexpensive
this wheel does the job it 's not super fancy but you still get the driving experience enjoy
i bought this for my kids to use with nascar racing controls are easily reprogramable nice product for the money
dear seller the price was good the product was good your delivery was excellent ! but it did not come with even a sample of what it can do ! so what now i plugged it into my computer and everything loaded as it usually does but no games not even a starter edition pardon my ignorance but even when i registered with logitech there was no reference to an actual usuable and downloadable game for this device confused new gamer i bought this for my five year old who is as mystifyed as i am this product is not a recommend for the novice such as myself just go out and buy a complete system that has all the bits and pieces included time and disappointment
the relatively inexpensive logitech nascar wheel and pedals are analog a must for racing games like need for speed analog potentiometers slide along infinite voltage points between or right the wheel suction cups hold snugly for a standard desktop the pedals tend to slip slightly and may be at a slightly awkward angle but can easily be mounted to a small inexpensive piece of hardboard or plywood or car floormat you could also design a wood framework the try me '' wheel i returned was digital full or right as ineffective as using keyboard arrow keys
i purchased this product for my 3 yr old he loves it and it works with most of his computer games to my surprise it did not come with instructions so we 're having to self teach ourselves the features surprisingly i ca n't get the vibration feature to work with his nascar game and this is a nascar race wheel the vibration works for his spongebob game
i bought two of these wheels last month and i 'm about to order 2 more i 'm setting up a little company picnic racing rally i played midnight run ii windows with these wheels and did n't experience the force feedback either however when i played nascar 3 with these wheels then i got vibrations in the steering wheel when taking turns too tight but nothing when bumping the wall or another car the force feedback amounts to a 'humming ' vibration and is actually annoying btw there 's an option in nascar 3 you have to turn on for the force feedback to work the force feedback was just a 'nice ' feature for me but i really got it for the usb connection and table top design i have a couple of the interact racing wheels and their 'sit nestled between your legs ' design is awkward to deal with and it 's too tall to effectively use them on a table but the logitech wheels work great on a table top ! the logitech connectors are a little more reliable too the pin connector housing on the snapped off pretty easily on one of the wheels however i do prefer 's full size pedals to the logitech smaller pedals but it 's satisfactory
i have used these for over two years now and they work absolutely great i have burned movies games files everything have n't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the dvd players i tried them out on not much else to say
excellent flawless works great on my pc 's sony burner highly recommend no coasters yet
been using memeorex 's 's since and their 's since 2001. i have never had any issue with memeorex media so i never bother using anything else not one dvd coaster created with pioneer 's
these are the best 's on the market i have only had a handful of these not work out of the hundreds that i have used very stable and plays on most dvd players highly recomend ! ca n't beat the price
this unit set up great i am using it to backup my dvr and hdtv box these components wipe out various settings whenever there is the slightest power interruption this unit has served me well
i bought this belkin battery backup after a power failure disaster was narrowly averted by ms word 's autorecovery feature it 's worked fine at warding off power failures since i have n't really tested how well it does what it 's supposed to do i do have some comments on usability my wife finds the necessity to press and hold the power switch for several seconds i would like the backup outlets to be controlled by the switch so i could shut everything down for power conservation with one step
shipping took awhile but considering the weight of this item i still think it was excellent quick shipping service the price was excellent especially since i knew the model i needed beforehand and had priced it on other web sites too when i need to buy something i generally loook at amazon first now and seldom need to go any further
power ups ! everything you need to know first of all why do you want a power ups there are some very good reasons 1 you never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout 2 you want to work with clean power only 3 you want to monitor your pc power 4 you want to prevent your pc from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection the first rule about ups is to never trust the insurance claim get your pc insured elsewhere these companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims i have a pc running some very high specifications with over six usb devices lcd monitor printer and ethernet equipment with everything on at the same time i have never gone above of usage and average between and when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks even though i have a power supply unit psu i will be upgrading to a psu because it is better quality model the way i can monitor how many watts i use is with ups software and hardware so the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using the short answer to this is you do n't know until you install the ups and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time you need to estimate what it is i would say a domestic pc not a server would use max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on as soon as we add things like another pc or several printers or several monitors then we can start to overload a ups this brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any ups overloading and balancing the overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the ups capacity overloading does two things it can in theory eventually damage the ups and it voids the warranty most ups are but there are and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one pc setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups for a network so check the ups rating what ups you choose depends on how much you want to load on it next thing you need to check with the ups is if it comes with a usb connection if it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your pc and the ups comes with software now if the ups has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off ups sound alarms controlling how your ups handles a blackout how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation if it sounds an alarm or not if it run self tests data collection and monitoring notifications and sensitivity settings if the ups does not come with a usb connection and software then you probably should be looking for an ups designed for computer use rather than a ups for equipment most ups have led indicators that tell you the status of the unit the next thing to understand is that testing your ups is not done by breaking it out of the box connecting it to the mains plugging your pc in and then turning off the house 's power with the circuit breaker you must charge the ups first ! so read the instructions usually you must attach the battery to the ups plug it in firmly ! and wait before using it then perform the test using the software first ! then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the pc stays up usually a ups is programmed to shutdown your pc if the blackout lasts for a few seconds nearly all ups models with a usb connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the pc should hold for on the ups battery most ups devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem this is important because power surges on a ups that do not have this protection can damage a pc through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the pc somehow this is nasty problem with the degree of security that a ups can provide if it does n't have this function then it is not going to provide 100 surge protection with a pc that is networking a ups pc to another pc without ups can also increase the risk of surge protection problems it is not recommend that you network a ups pc to a pc unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue one last thing is that some ups have input regions on the ups for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot this is everything you need to know about an ups before you choose one it is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the ups and making sure it provides you with what you need the two top brands are apc and belkin
outlets are on top of case easy to plug in and change plug ins narrow case width allows backup unit to fit in the space available in my roll around computer cart switch is recessed and on front with lightup controls no bumping switch and shuting off accidentally
i had similar problem with tv not turning on after having purchase a year ago for almost year it worked great ! ! tried all solutions given to me amazon was helpful with contact info it took about 2 weeks trying to get service when samsung could not fix problem it was resolved by offering to send me new replacement this years model i am completely satisfied with service
it 's a great buy the only problem that i have is the dnle '' wo n't stay on and no one can seem to tell me how to keep it on i get a sort of cloudy look but it 's tolerable other than that it 's great i 'm pleased
pros three customizable video profiles movies broadcast tv excellent brightness and contrast good viewing angles l r of center generous input options cons big centered button cries out for my toddler to turn it finally put a barbell in front of it the biggest con has not to do with the tv but the dearth of hd content others ' comments about broadcast tv looking horrible on hd sets can not be overemphasized same for dvds on sd dvd players on the latter note buy a good upcoverting dvd player 150 the visual results were simply outstanding also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum hdmi preferred using or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the tv so the other 'con ' is that you will probably need a new receiver and cables so to recap if you want a good experience you need an hd tv upconverting dvd player receiver with component or better yet hdmi connections and hd broadcast content cable or satellite this is not a cheap endeavor
the tv is really nice it works easily i have it hooked up to a cable network my friend also bought one about a week earlier and i liked hers so i ordered mine i would recommend it to anyone who wants a first class hdtv the service is quick and efficient the picture is fantastic
wonderful picture quality in hd dvd displays well too standard cable signal not really much difference would recommend this tv to anyone just understand that you need hd programming for this tv to really shine the audio of this tv is ok nothing special but it gets the job done i have it hooked up to a surround sound and love it
i should first note that i am no expert on television sets and was more than a little confused by all the different technologies out on the marketplace after some research and a little help from a local home theater company i settled on this tv if 13 '' of depth is n't an issue for your application this tv offers picture quality on par with the more expensive plasmas and lcds could n't be happier with my purchase
the previous reviews are similar to mine all one has to do is watch the discovery hd theater and immediately they will realize what a great tv it is but also the picture quality is sharp color is beautiful and the tv is not 300 pounds in weight i enjoy my 42 '' samsung dlp hdtv way more than i ever realized possible
you may as well pitch the instructions because they 're worthless and the only reason i 'm not giving a rating for the ads tech video xpress i was about ready to pitch the product as well after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work ultimately i gave up on relying solely on the program it came with and i instead opted to try it on my windows movie maker yahoo ! perseverance paid off ! once i switched to movie maker this tool worked great ! to date i 've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that i was able to burn to dvds i just leave my xpress hooked up to the back of my television so i do n't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again doing that i can connect my laptop to the xpress and start the video converting process within minutes my movie maker program takes over the entire process the ads tech video xpress has been especially useful for me because i teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students before purchasing xpress i had crudely edited videos that i was reluctant to use my videos had lots of amateur points using movie maker with xpress i was able to download these videos to my laptop then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless pretty cool i 'm glad i took a chance on this product ! below are and program instructions i 've written to myself for easy reference later hopefully they 'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product first hook up the video xpress equipment as follows 1. buy one since it does n't come with the videoxpress goes from the back of your television to the videoxpress 2. use cords running into the back of the that is hooked up to your televion as follows all three plug into the video out '' column all three plug into the videoxpress tool at the other end 3. the usb plug for the videoxpress tool plugs into the back of the computer next open the instant video xpress program and verify the settings are as follows ntsc m '' for the video standard setting 640 x 480 '' and 60 fps vga '' for video format dvd vcr tv '' for video source video composite '' for video input under the program advanced settings low motion tv vcd dvd cpu support '' stereo system mts '' video decoder video standard '' under properties within the program advanced settings stream format video format '' frame rate 59.940 '' color '' outputs size '' finally close the instant video xpress program windows movie maker ca n't access the video until this program is closed and yes it 's silly to have to open it make those setting changes then close it but video xpress wo n't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps in case you need this information for windows movie maker the steps in order are as follows under file '' click on capture video '' use the following settings audio device set at analog audio device '' video input source set at composite '' under configure video capture device video format video standard '' frame rate 29.970 '' color '' output size '' under camera settings deinterlace method low motion tv vcd dvd '' cpu support '' stereosystem mts '' under video decoder video standard '' signal detected 1 '' lines detected 525 '' then give the file a name and indicate where to save it set it for best quality '' for playback then start capture '' if the video xpress is hooked up and running correctly you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television but you will not hear the sound when you finish capturing and play it back then you 'll hear the sound i know i know clear as mud but hey it 's better than the xpress instructions !
great product for getting all those old home videos on dv
this little unit is easy to use and ready to go ! ! ! ! not one problem with it so far i 've been using it for over two months now
aa batteries sure come in handy around here we have seven battery operated clocks and all seven use aa 's we also have remote controls and a small radio plus other items that use aa 's now you see why i bought this 50 pack the expiration date on my 50 pack is december 2011 and i bought these batteries from amazon a few months ago for what i use these batteries for they are holding up great priced right too definitely worth it !
batteries made in china good for everyday use for 10 a good bu
its really works fine for my items as well as my son 's toys we both are happy with this
wow 50 batteries for 9 bux is a deal ! and of course it lasts as long as a name brand battery if your going to use it for small devices cd player clock etc get sumthing else if your going to use these for a camera
how can you beat the price i bought this at from an awesome deal i found on
get them on sale they work just as well as the bigger name brands for a lot less money
i use these batteries when i need power immediately and i do n't have a set of rechargeables ready to go i also use them as backups so i do n't get caught without power and have to pay 1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores unfortunately my kids keep stealing them instead of recharging their own set
excellent sound system reminds you of being in a movie theatre great great system
i purchased this item recently and it 's excellent in all aspects it took me less than a hour to set it up and the super cool auto calibration takes cares of calibrating the speakers without having the pain of doing it manually the subwoofer delivers a meaty bass and the surround speakers are very impressive the centre channel could have been powered up a bit more so that it can deliver the movie dialogues in depth but still it does a good job overall i would say it 's an excellent choice when you compare the cost vs performance
i use them on ilo dvd recorder and also for recording home movies or data disk i have not had a problem with any of them ever i love them ! plus a great price !
i have been using memorex blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd not all of my recordings were successful no product i know is 100 perfect but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media this spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping moreover i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon after trying many blank media i found memorex spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance
i think those who are complaining have broken drives or computers i have been using these for about a year with zero defects
i use sonic burner program and these discs have worked perfectly fine good quality and quantity perfectly satisfied with this product
i see a lot of negative reviews here but i 've been using these discs for a couple months now with my powerbook 's superdrive and i 've had no problems at least none that i would attribute to the discs themselves one review laments toast titanium 7 which in my experience is a very finnicky buggy program i too had a number of failed burns with that program but i was able to remedy the situation by saving my dvd projects as disc images and then burning them later with disc utility after i had a chance to mount them and check them out for the price i payed for these discs if i remember right almost half the price of a 25 pack from other companies for a 50 pack from memorex i am very very pleased if you 're looking to play around with dvd burning and i guarantee you you will make a few mistakes and have to throw away a few discs before you get it right this is the best deal you 'll find anywhere
these dvd 's are really good i have yet to have any
i 've had this drive for a year now and i 've burned over 500 dvds the drive is still going strong with no signs of giving up i 've had a total of 4 coasters and they 've always been the fault of the blank dvds not the drive itself never had compatibility problems with dvds or cds and i 've even used some overseas memorex tdk fujifilm sony you name it and i 've burned it if you 're looking for a dependable good performance cheap drive look no further
the burner works well except when burning dual layer discs i have colleagues that also have this problem with dual layer discs when using other burners so it 's most likely a problem in nero and not the drive
all this has been said before but here it is again sony 's with accucore '' will burn at tdk will only burn at wherever you buy this buy it oem save the money for a better version of nero burning rom bundled retail software is junk i 've had mine for months now and burned most every format on dvds and cd 's no coasters it 's quite but you can here it run it has a busy light if it 's on it 's busy firmware updates for media are readily available present version is you can buy this under 50 and it works great with my amd and windows
very easy to install i 'm not very hardware literate i have used it to copy music with the and movies with so far no coasters it has done more than i expected and no problems my only complaint is it does n't have light scribe like the european models highly reccomend this to anyone looking to upgrade their computer
i bought this burner for around 40 i needed to add this for my system which didnot have the dvd burner part and also needed to backup my information this is easy to install if you are going to have two drives running then you need to set up one drive as master and the other drive as slave the white ide cable that is allready present in your system usually has this labels usually the top end of the ide white cable is the master and the middle point is the slave now also connect another power point at the same end as your previous drive and you are ready to roll if your computer doesnot recognise either of the drives then you need to change the jumper settings at the very back of your drive by the side of the ide cable slot you have another small slot whith three pairs of pins one end of them is covered with a black clip like jumper you need to change it to the other end and then restart your comp please donot forget to turn the power off now about this burner this is an amazing piece which burns dvds really silently it comes with nero 6 software which is easy to use i didnot need any upgrades of the software the older version works fine for me the reason i have given it 4 stars only is because it makes a funny noise when it reads my dvds funny looking at how silent it is when it burns them it also will read dvds that have scratches and other drives wont recognise all in all this is a very good buy for the price if it is to be your second drive and hey it is a nec so dont worry update 6 months later this nec burner works very well and is very silent when burning the dvds infact so silent that initially i wasnt sure if it was actually burning the dvds i would recommend nero software for this burner all in all a solid buy for the price and performance
i bought this dvd burner because my friends all told me that it was a great burner and i compared it to other specs of dvd burners without breaking the bank and by far this burner was the cheapest and was the fastest of all the cheaper burners i could find i can burn a full dvd in 40 minutes 30 minutes spent reading the disc and 10 actually writing it it works great with my memorex 's i loved this burner so much that i bought another one so i now have two burners in my computer i highly recommend this burner and the nero software that comes with it is great
not quite as powerful as i was hoping for but the sound is alright and in a small room it 'll do fine careful there is no at the back so you can only connect or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack otherwise it 's easy to use and pretty ideal for quiet listening lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff
i do n't know much about audio nor do i have a good basis for comparison but fwiw the system works fine and sounds good
we were very pleased with the system it arrived on time it was a present and we found it easy to use and good value for the price
this is an awesome little system for the size it was easy to set up even for an electronically challenged person like myself a lot of fine sound comes out of this compact system the price was great and delivered right to my door amazing
the product performs great it produces quality sound and offers excellent value for its price point the stereo does everything the manufacturer claims and it meets all my needs
i have just purchased my case logic dvd album this is the greatest way to store dvd's
everyone so far is right this is a great product to store your dvd 's you do have to trim the covers to fit beyond that is works perfectly i have 3 of them i would recomend this to anyone with a large dvd collection
caselogic has set the standard for media storage and this continues the tradition a few tweaks are needed however i am certain that i will soon fill the 20 slots therefore it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk the graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed actually i would prefer that the dvd companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around
if you have a lot of dvds or cds these wallets are the way to go i have over 800 cds and they were eating up my space after getting rid of all the jewel cases i can store all of my cds and dvds on one book shelf and since i organized them by theme it is easy to find what i am looking for by the way you can mark the outside of the wallets with a pen it makes it easy to know what 's inside each wallet for the dvd wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the liner notes but it is easy to do trust me once you start using these wallets you 'll love 'em for what you get with these wallets i find the price fair even better here on enjo
i was scepticle at first that something looking that flimsy could really hold the weight of 622 cds the assembly was easy though time consuming i would recommend that you use those plastic washers otherwise if you decide to move the rods you get nasty marks on the wood i would recommend this unit to anyone wanting all of their cds in one spot very stable even on carpet
this monitor is one of the best i 've ever seen it works perfectly the picture is wonderful the controls are great on the monitor this is my first lcd monitor and i just love it if you are thinking about it buy this one it is well worth it
i liked this monitor a lot the picture is good it 's also light enough for me to carry it was easy to hook up i have had sony monitors before and liked them
i am very leery about these flat screen monitors however i am enjoying the sony very much i bought a pixo and it blew out in only three months someone told me to get a sony they 've had it six years and nothing happened to it yet so your reviews are very helpful to me thanks guys
i searched and hunted this monitor for the best price for months i first saw this monitor at best buy i was so impressed with the quality of the picture i was sold on xbrite '' but i hesitated at the price of 399.00 i watched the ads for months checked other retail outlets searched other online retailers and went back to best buy on several occations to see this monitor hoping i could catch this item as an open box item '' i am very happy with this monitor set up was a breeze connect plug in and go when i do buy a new pc with digital for monitors this monitor is already able to switch the clarity is remarkable i am using 1280 x 1024 resolution that fits this screen perfectly i ca n't add anymore to what other reviewers have already said about it stats as far as quality and service and price from i give them 5 stars i have no complaints i would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for quality
whether you have a viao notebook or a sony plasma tv or a flat panel or even a crt sony offers one of the most striking and crystal clear images in this world it 'll cost you a lot more than brands like acer viewsonic or dell but mind you sony has been making tv 's for a lot longer than any of these companies so their technologies carry over to all of their displays ca n't go wrong with this japanese marvel of a company
after reading tons of info checking critics ' recommendations and comparing monitors online i went to check them out at a compusa store after seeing some of the monitors and brands the critics like many of the monitors appeared similar with only vague differences except this sony it outshined all others by a wide margin there are two sony models that have the same frame so be sure you look at the one with the xbrite '' technology because it 's very different i have never needed the height adjustment and wires are totally unobtrusive this was a plug and play unit no adjustments were necessary i changed the but went right back so far after about a month living with this monitor i ca n't say too many good things about it
i have started to use this with my new gaming computer and i have found it a very nice product i got it for 340 making it cheaper then the others and also making it a very good buy after spending so much on other things i would highly recomend this and hope you get it for as good a deal as i did from this site
i purchased this for my special needs son who is 4 and needed a case for his cd player it is very lightweight and soft and has space for a few of his cds the adjustable belt is very easy to open and close and make larger and smaller i am very pleased to have made this purchase
just wanted to note that the contract is available at the top of this page if you buy this service plan print out the contract and keep your receipt i have no idea how true they are to their contract but i read the service plan intensely since i nearly got it some notes on the contract 1. it is only good in the united states including washington dc but minus maine but it does not include guam virgin islands etc so if you are in another country or outside the 50 states this contract will be nothing but a waste of money 2. this contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple 3. they will only if the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item that is if the manu warranty is still good you have to use it 4. if the item needs to be shipped will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period if the item is being replaced you will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered product to our authorized service center reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to you '' i 'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you 5. no lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the same defect and a upon the time of a repair as determined by them they will replace it with a product of comparable performance repairs performed while the product is under manufacturer 's warranty do not apply '' does n't sound like a great no lemon policy your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you many electronics are covered by the manufacturer for 1 year 6. there are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans such as they do n't cover accidents and they do n't cover the elements or acts of god '' sorry i had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things but in all seriousness read the list before you purchase so now that i have summarized much of the contract if you want to get the service warranty please read the contract since i did n't cover everything ! ! ! do n't hold me liable since i do n't have much money anyways also i think this is typical in warranty contracts but you will occassionally see the phrase at our discretion '' in the contract assuming they are n't jerks with their discretion and are n't too tough to deal with i would give the warranty 4 stars minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy i did n't get the coverage because the product i was going to get it for had just made into the next price category so it was pricy for my product being at the lower price end of the scale
i have had three of these units for the past years one for my pc one for the wife 's and one for the tivo cable box we have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running however they do n't last too long on battery power just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things down the batteries wore out after about years so i replaced them using batteries from a web vendor now the first battery of this second round has failed so i 'm buying another round of three batteries hopefully these units will last many more years
had mine since december 1999 but noticed that the battery failed after about 3 years like the other poster wrote apc did n't list a replacement at first but now they do and i finally got around to replacing it battery type is for those wondering solid unit having a telephone and usb controller is a plus
this unit is my ups made by apc i out grew the other and decided on this unit the usb connection is what sold me on this as i leave my computer on most of the day it did shut down using the included software during a test i ran and the software as gives you a battery charge state a must have if you are in an area that has frequent power problems with the built in surge protection you ca n't go wrong
i have about 25 apc at my job where i am currently work for school when the thurderstorm hits my school many time it wo n't kill all of computer server and others important computer i am so gladly to have this apc because save my time to maintance if lost everything i want buy one of my own personal at home which i need
this is a great little disposable armband i say disposable because its so cheap you can toss it if you want and get a new one nice adjustable band although i can see this wearing out in the future as the band loses elasticity great for the gym it even comes with a little custom fit lcd screen protector which is a nice touch the arm band is removable so even if you are just looking for a skin this is a stea
i love this arm band i have had it for about 6 months now you dont have to take your ipod out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer i also only use my ipod for the gym so its nice that this arm band provides great protection better than ipod 's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on as well as not coming off while working out
there 's not really a lot to say about this product it protects your nano the material is good quality it is not too thick does n't bulk up the nano too much and not too thin provides enough protection i wanted this to go jogging with my ipod it fills that function perfectly the strap is comfortable the only flaw that i have found this does not bother me but i know it might bother others hence 4 instead of 5 stars the material does act as a bit of a dust collector if you put it in a dusty packet it will collect a lot of dust
way more affordable than what is out there fits ipod nano snuggly and adjusts nicely great for runners
i have used this item frequently on solo marathon training runs works fantastic a better buy than the apple brand armband by far
this armband was certainly the right price i use it everytime i work out at the health club i never have to remove it to charge the nano my only negative comment is that dust sticks to the screen cover and can not be cleaned off due to the compsition of the screen cover material
this is definitely a great investment i can take as many pictures as i want to and not have to worry that the stick is getting full i have two sons who also like to take pictures and in the past i would have to take my pictures off the stick so they could use it to take their pictures because the stick we were using had less memory and got full really fast now i can leave my pictures on the memory stick as long as i want to until i 'm ready to download them or delete them everyone should start off with a memory stick because it 's convenient and really worth the money spent
the sony 1 gb memory stick has tons of room for all my photos it makes it great when you 're on a vacation and you do n't have to worry if you have enough room for anything more you do pay a little more though for the sony brand than you would a chip with another manuf
the 1 gb card took all the pictures on a trip to hawaii over 300
really great the product got delivered before what i expected
we ordered this item to go with our new sony digital camera we drove all around colorado and this memory stick was perfect for storing all our pictures we even were able to do a 'slide show '' on our computer for our family and friends after we got home
i am very glad i purchased this and that too from amazon i just love the service i get from amazon
i purchased this for my new sony digital camera and so far all has been perfect just click it right in and you have a gig of space i 've been shooting pics like crazy ! throwing in a 640 fine movie mode to boot and still have room for a ton of pics ! love the card love the camera ! !
a memory stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a sony camera fantastic
i have no complaints about amazon on this item but i do with sony because their memory stick is not regular '' sized it does not fit into my hp memory stick slot so i have to use a cable connection with my sony camera my previous digital had a standard size memory stick that slid right into my computer i gave that camera to my son who loves that feature also for his computer it 's strange to me that sony would choose not to be a standard size in this memory stick business it just does not make sense to me
i 've been using this card with my canon for the past 9 months and am very pleased with it however about a month ago i noticed that the write speed increased from about a second to seconds per image it 's kind of annoying since it was so quick before but other than that the card has served me well
first i bought a sandisk and after a month of use got damaged i tryed to comunicate with them a lot they have the worst customer service then i gave up then i bought this viking like a year ago and im still using it
i bought this card for my digital camera and i have had it for a while now i have not had any problems with it it was fairly cheap and the speed seems to be fine i reccomend it for anything except recording full video at 30 fps because since this is n't a high speed card when i tried to record at that quality and resolution i only got about 15 or 20 seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow other than that i like this card and reccomend i
i bought the card mnths ago at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller ! finally it gave a 'error reading card ' message and stopped working customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt they replaced the card is 7 days they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered 'lost ' in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it ! i was impressed with the excellent support but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life would i buy it again yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well
i 've been using this system for a couple of months now and could n't be happier with it i bought it for my office so i could listen to my classical cds while i was working on my website and writing book reviews plus even though it only has a short external antenna i can get the npr classical music station on fm which is over a hundred miles away it 's small enough to fit on my bookshelf and has great sound for the size of its speakers of course it does n't compare to my big stereo in the living room with its 4 ' high tower speakers but who cares it delivers most of the sound i need in a small space for background music all in all well worth the money so far highly recommended at this point
it has become nearly impossible to find a compact stereo of any quality with a cassette deck and an aux input i mean what is with the marketing hype these days of and ipod compatible ! '' all you need is an aux line input for pete 's sake my old jvc purchased nearly 20 years ago had aux in and with the help of easily found adaptor still plays all my ipods just fine but the belt drive on the tape deck failed twice and repairing it is no longer an option so we bought this and it works but the build quality is less than stellar the sound is simply ok and the remote works provided you have a clear line of sight to the unit but all that given the price i think it 's a good deal hope this helps
out of the carton everything worked as advertized and the sound is pleasant the speakers are the weak link the day after i set it up to test it i replaced the speakers with an inexpensive pair of radioshack speakers i bought years ago model i believe 4 '' woofer '' tweeter in a small solid sealed enclosure of walnut veneer these speakers are half the size of the supplied sonys and at least twice the weight the improvement in sound was astounding it transformed this package which has a robust amp into something worth listening to for hours on end it reproduced a wide range of music from a beethoven string quartet to louis armstrong doing fats waller to renee ' fleming doing marietta 's lied '' with full orchestra all with surprising authority my only concern with the main unit is that the latch on the cd lid on top of the unit may one day wear out preventing the lid from closing the cassette player worked without any problems i have yet to learn how to set the timer for the unit to turn on but the instruction book is clear and the remote is handy and easy to use i wonder how my main system with axiom and a klipsh subwoofer would sound off this modest box from sony or the old jensen i use in my 'study ' system put a classic pair of jbl lancers on this unit and i do n't think you would be the least bit dissappointed as i said out of the carton the system works fine and the sound is pleasant enough but be aware that the electronics in the box are waiting to bloom if you have an old pair of moderately efficient speakers in the basement or attic dust them off hook them up and enjoy
i 'm very happy with this desktop system great sound great reception great price
i was trying to find a small unit for the bedroom to replace a previous unit the model 30 watts not the fits the bill the sound is incredible and loud for a small unit it sounds better than the bigger unit i had the design of the speakers with the special bass produces a very rich and round sound and that 's without the dsg activated the bass and treble can be adjusted -3 to +3 but only with the remote if you buy a unit used be sure it has the remote also i needed something with a tape player like another reviewer
as the previous reviews had said no frills basic functions good sound compact size clean look and a reasonable price exactly what i have been looking for for a long time and could not find !
for 100 this little stereo does everything i need it to this micro '' unit is truly small it fits on top of our microwave speakers and all the replaced a boombox that conked out to replace it i wanted something through which i could play my player that function works well it is an simple auxiliary input and allows me to play my podcasts at home without walking around with headphones on at 30 watts the sound is ample for the kitchen and significantly more powerful than what i had previously i did n't want something so powerful that needed to be played loudly in order to get full sound that is not to say it ca n't put out some volume however as for sound quality it is the very crisp balanced sound that sony fans have come to expect for the wide range of music i play the bass and treble settings cover it all the player may discourage some people but since it can play cds you can get some serious playtime out of it for myself my cooking is rarely so complicated that i ca n't stop to change a cd anyhow but i saved the best thing for last it has a cassette player ! insert cricket chirps here all in all i am very happy with this unit for its versatility size and sound quality it was the perfect solution for my needs
if you 're looking for bells and whistles look elsewhere if you 're looking for 3 or 5 disc changer not this one if you need a nice little stereo to play one cd at a time space saving full and clean tone this is awesome ! ! ! it looks really sharp has a crisp sound perfect for a small bedroom or office i am very happy with this purchase has a tape deck as well and radio eq settings are simple no presets just bass and treble there is also dsgx switch kind of like a loudness setting just leave it on very simple well made i like it ! ! no frills great price
this portable cd holder is perfect for me i work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym my cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd 's i like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch i would recommend it to anyone
i am currently running an online business the expandability that this piece of equipment provides for our laptops is a great asset
i bought it thinking that would help me entering ascii codes because my inspiron it 's uncorfortable with some programs in spanish but does n't work with alt key i do n't know why because everything is working good i 'd like someone tell me if ther 's something i should do
i hate not having a number pad on my laptop and this product ameliorates that situation good stuff
the objective was to improve speed when i 'm write down figures and doing maths 100 acomplished maybe the keypad it 's a solution for that kinf of stuff i use it for anything more but that was the idea for get it the price is reazonable the service of amazon good as usual considering i 'm from chile and always when i purchase something in amazon always come to me ok
i certainly wish it were smaller but i guess that 'd be hard to manage while retaining the feel of a normal keypad the unit works well and adds some features that would probably be handy for spreadsheet work like enter and backspace keys
i bought this to read my smartmedia cards and it worked very well as an added bonus it is also a nice looking product it is sky blue and has a clear usb cord sort of reminds me of an imac good little inexpensive card reader note i did't use it for any card type other than smartmedia
this system is not the most sophisticated or powerful you can buy but it represents a great value for the money i 've had no trouble operating it after a reasonably quick and simple installation a great feature is the changer after you 've tried it you will wonder how you did without it the ability to move from disk to disk without having to them is a huge conveinience factor highly recommended
i have this in the bedroom connected to a 13 '' tv it plays dvds as well as cds the sound is great and it has a classy understated look i am thinking of buying one for my office and once for the garage
first of all let me say that i love this stereo have had it for a year or two i do n't think you can do any better with this price range and more i highly recommend it i have a question does anyone know whether this stereo plays dvd 's of all regions i tried to write jvc an email but did n't get any response hopefully somebody has the answer ! thanks
when i saw this component stereo system in a good guys '' store i was immediately impressed with the overall look of the thing as i started toying with the floor model i realized how versatile it was and decided that it was something i wanted to own sadly the floor model was the only unit left in the store and there would n't be anymore coming since good guys '' was going out of business that was not acceptable to me so i went elsewhere to find the same system when i found the item for a much better price i was sold getting it only took a few days and it was delivered right to my place of work for my convienence what impressed me the most about the unit was the sheer depth of sound it produced when playing a movie with grand scenes and lots of special effects the little system did not disappoint in giving a theatrical experience in sound other features were also pretty cool to me such as the lcd light while it gave off a nice blue glow it could be dimmed which was a nice touch all in all with all the features this device has i am certain i will have many years of enjoyment it is a great system for the right price and truly impressive
i needed a small system for my office i wanted removable speakers good sound at all volumes and a sleek look this system filled that void i searched for about a month to get it and there is nothing less than fantastic about this system even the price in terms of sound i can understand music at all volume levels many cheaper systems distort at low levels and at high volumes it sounds great i ca n't use it at high volumes now that i 've taken it to work but i am thinking about buying another for my living room at home run the output of my family room stereo and i 'll have a system that sounds good in both places for parties in terms of looks this system is very cool i tried to downplay it by placing it behind my desk on the shelf where i keep my food so that people would n't question it because small stereos are allowed but not everyone likes us having them despite my attempts to blend it in i 've received several complements on the way that it looks silver casing and a sleek design are just the basics this system features a blue backlit display that looks great ! i thought that the dvd '' option in the stereo meant that you could play on dvd a great idea for someone who wants to never have to change cds but in fact it meant that the system is a dvd player and it has a video output to connect to your tv that 's a nice plus i have n't tried the idea yet so it may or may not support them the stock antenna is terrible but so are most stereo antennas i 'll buy a new one soon the other downside is that you ca n't switch between presets without the remote you can change the station but not using presets but with 30 fm presets i 'll never run out ! the only thing that was n't obvious about the is that the disk buttons disk 1 disk 2 etc on the stereo are the eject buttons not the select buttons like most other stereos overall this is a great design for a great stereo i used to work at a radio station as the engineer and now i wish i had this back then because i could blast music in my office and really utilize the system the way it was meant
note to brian the be configured as a bridge i have two of them in just such a configuration took me about 10 minutes to set them up major modes of operation are 1. wireless access point its default 2. wireless client connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the and you now have a wireless ethernet device 3. wireless repeater extend range of wireless coverage 4. wireless bridge connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them acts as one end of a virtual '' cable you need two to get the job done a pair of wireless bridges is just what i needed but hesitated to buy the because of brian 's comment that this would n't work because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that brian was wrong i bought a pair and they do work i rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons 1. i understand that more expensive equipment can be had with more range than this box got ta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment ! 2. one must dig very deeply into the users guide a pdf on the cd to find the default ip address in order to configure this device luckily i had read elsewhere what that ip address is other manufacturers make this info readily available even going so far as printing it on the device itself this will be critical info to any linux user also the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is admin '' well it 's not the only allowed userid is an empty field this had me going for a few minutes 3. something that 99 of the world wo n't care about i like to have more access to the firmware for example other linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do analysis of the box and the network it 's attached to i think there are firmware loads that enable this
this is a good basic wifi access point i 've bought many easy to set up and use it occasionally disconnects but a firmware upgrade usually fixes it easily i have many in service
i bought two the second one after realizing that one will not work as a bridge it plugs into the linksys cable gateway in one room and to a switch in the other room nothing more to say follow the instructions and it will work as advertised
i 'll admit after reading some of these reviews i was a little weary of purchasing this unit but i got it for 32 so could n't pass it up i was replacing a linksys wireless b in a nutshell i followed the instructions to connect the hardware popped the cd in my hard wired '' desktop pc took a couple of minutes to step through the setup screens which are totally simple to navigate enabling wep along the way when i was done i fired up my laptop which has built in card network was detected immediately all i had to do was type in the wep key which was generated from my passphrase entered during the setup and viola ! connected at 54 mbps ! ! awesome the setup procedure could not have been any easier i would recommend this device to anyone that already has a router with a free port and simply wants to add or upgrade connectivity in their home
everything it says it is and it 's not as bulky as the adapters with large wires strung out the back of a oval looking hub slick looking
this is a great product for those who need to transfer files from a digital camera without the hasle of software its easy and quick i use it every chance i get and it fits in your pocket what more can you ask for
i love the mobilemate sd i have n't had any problems yet it 's small compact and gets the job done
which turned out to be a problem for me since thats not what i wanted i was looking for a compact flash card reader for the older compact flash cards and just assumed that sd and cf were the same luckily i also has some transflash cards that i am using it with and it works great i especially like the small design with no cords like a lot of other flash readers have
this tiny piece of plastic with metal contacts packs more whallop than you could imagine sure memory geeks like me may find little things like this more than the next but practically speaking it is good for more than just the techno geek what this large amount of memory provides is a way to store tons of pictures movies ringtones etc over a long period of time and then you can dump '' it onto your computer the other thing you can do with it is store a lot of music to play on your
i bought this card reader to use with my sd memory cards from my digital camera and palm tungsten transferring pictures and music via the cables supplied with the camera and palm is a bit slow and who needs more cables this little device allows me to add delete copy and paste files using my computer it takes up virtually no room and i use it between both my desktop and laptop computers there was no installation issues i have windows xp on both machines and it recognized and installed the card reader immediately without any interference from me last but not least the price ca n't be beat
this gizmo is really cool i use it with my verizon phone and tranfer music and data back and forth as i wish with no problem
i purchased the elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i do n't have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of and sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
this one was purchased for my pocket pc have been storing files pictures and more important my recordings clearly it 's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam i got it at a really good price !
this is a great buy because i have a lot of space i use the card on my digital camera and i take a lot of pictures without download to the computer i can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until back home it 's a great card at a very good price
i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again
the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent
i 'm afraid i do n't know a lot about this technology i went for economy and i am getting very good quality photos i think i would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and i really do n't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow its still faster than my old one so i 'm generally happy hope this is some hel
i bought this memory card for my camera at first i was very dispointed when i only see on my laptop after googled around i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over i 'm able to see full after driver update just make sure you update your first
product has performed well and have experienced no problems with it i am using it in an hp 5 megapixel digital camera it will hold 248 pictures at best resolution or 26 miutes of video with sound
hi i 'm a tomtom addict i 've been addicted ever since i first plugged in my tomtom 300 and found a new way to work ever since i 've relied on my tomtom to get me from point a to point the user interface is easy to use intuitive and clever and allows me to find nearby restaurants hotels or even train stations nearby my tomtom is so great i 've even let friends borrow it at work when they have a meeting with a client they have never been to before there are some problems anytime i find my way somewhere using my tomtom i ca n't find my way home without the tomtom that 's why i 'm addicted it 's reduced my frustration in the car and made me really happy thanks tomtom your friend never lost dre
i used it around my city and even took it to hawaii and it was a lot of help people forget that the idea of the gps is to help you find where you are where you want to go and how to get there but like everything else it may not be 100 correct really is what i did n't like about it was the windshield mount broke so it no longer sticks on the windshield the biggest thing is that the maps are i live in an area where they are building a lot of new homes even developments that are 2 years old are n't on the map ! i do n't mind paying for updates i realize that someone has to get paid to update the maps but i will not pay several hundred dollars to buy a whole new set of maps
received the tomtom 300 before date promised in perfect condition even though the box was dented good packing ! i have used the tomtom to go from nyc to monticello ny and from atlantic city new jersey to philadelphia pennsylvania and home to nyc again the tomtom performed flawlessly in philly guiding me to the sites i wanted to visit and back to my hotel i also tested it on routes i knew to see how it would route me if i deviated and it came through with flying colors the only shortcoming is that the display is difficult to read in bright sunshine the voice makes up for that letting you know when a turn is coming up i have a who has used this device for two years and is very satisfied i bought it on his recommendation and do not have any regrets
the tomtom go 300 did a great job navigating me around an unfamiliar city i 'd be lost without it for sure i would recommend anyone getting this it saved so much time i would have devoted to reading maps had i not had it
i 've been driving a logitech momo black for about 3 years and loved it until now this new wheel pedal and gearshift set is in a word awesome with 900 degree wheel rotation stronger force feedback a clutch and gated shifting the level of realism is unbelievable did you ever want to go racing but could n't afford the time or cost with this set and live for speed rfactor or one of these days iracing 's as yet unreleased programs you can and after some practice in the privacy of your own home '' you can go online and race live with folks all over the world you heart will pound and you will sweat ! okay maybe i 'm weird but at i still manage to find time to race hours a week ! and there are no long tiring drives to the race track no hotel and food expenses no long waits for the other classes to get off the track and no long drive home with a wrecked car on the trailer behind you an hour behind the wheel is an hour racing i have a heart valve problem and there are times i wonder if this is really safe after all
i 've had a few wheels before but finally logitech came out with a wheel thats simulation grade the 6 speed shifter works great and as for the clutch i 've found that there are plenty of games that support it including and need for speed carbon thats just coming out besides the lengthy setup and steep price this is a great wheel for a great racing experience
first the good the feedback is strong and prescise very smooth steering and it will immerse you into the game nfs most wanted and gtr 2 are great with this wheel the shifter is awesome although you do not want to beat it up a ginger approach makes it work best the pedals are very solid with good tension although you have to have very small feet if you are going to use all three i use my clutch for the brake forgetting the middle pedal now for the bad the clamping system works but for how long plastic screws are only going to last so long and you have to really tighten them for the wheel to stay put there are mounting nuts on the bottom but are you going to drill 2 holes through your desk microsoft has a superior clamp in my opinion the shifter works well and i am sure it will last with care be nice to it though the pedals are to close together other than that they are perfect overall i highly recommend this wheel for the money you ca n't get a better wheel
supposedly someone listened at the logi office of the nascar momo discontinuation for a cheeze model of nearly equal price that does not excuse this exorbiance the clutch pedal is not implimented in games and until it is you are paying for a dead hand or foot this wheel and the transmission hump style gearshift is quite cool and gee whiz is the first the console buttons are only useful again if the game does n't back out of it hard truck series backs out of any digit button or other past 10 with in a few minutes play time as it is not designed that way and can cause software corruptions one would usually need this for race car games but it can be used in other driver games making it more diverse and no need to buy a separate unit for compatiblity probs however in as and most games do not even use more than six or eight buttons or macros at a time the extra buttons are redundant gimiks the styl'n corvette style shifter with the console buttons is nice to look at stick a virtual transmission hump of carpeted cardboard on the ground under it for realistic effect and the gear can shift better than a rudder better used as a turn signal other than that either go down on price or give us config in games that do not support it shift is simply a way of saying shift with the clutch how lameo is that
considering the logitech website states that this product is n't available until i do n't know why people are ancy mine came 3 weeks ahead of amazon 's estimate anyway phenomenal build quality largest diameter wheel available and sturdy pedal base are among the highlights the shifter unit feels flimsy but as long as you do n't overdo it it should last its still just cool enough that they were able to pack in a gated shifter with a sequential option i 've played rfactor and richard burns rally with the wheel and the feedback is awesome probably does it the best if you 're ready to step up from consumer wheels and you ca n't afford the prosumer brd and ecci stuff i do n't think you 'd be disappointed with this
same as everybody else i ordered mine a couple of days back and it has n't shipped i want it ! ! ! ! !
i just got my email saying it shipped and am tracking it to receive it tomorrow so look for similar ones
i placed my order on october and for several days now it says 'the item is shipping soon ' which normally means it 's being packaged but it has n't actually been shipped i have n't called amazon yet but might do so today to find out what 's going on i want this wheel so bad
received notice last week that it was in the shipping stage it still is shows but it 's not actually shipping thought he page says it is contacted amazon and they say it 's shipping on the but the page still says and available for shipping i have no idea what 's going on here they were not at all clear did they
first of all let my point out that mine came with demos of crimson skies and mech assault and the full version of xbox classic arcade mine was new in the certified microsoft box etc maybe they just updated the games anyways it is in my opinion a better deal to buy the pack but i decided on the just because i 've got the trial already and did n't want 14 months built up in the box there 's the communicator headset a subscription card the game discs and several manuals on connecting to xbox live the communicator purely awesome i have read many people 's comments saying that it breaks at the little clip i grant it that the clip is thin and could potentially break easily but it is not uber fragile do n't be afraid to put it on the headset weighs next to nothing and is really comfortable it has great outgoing voice quality and great sound quality through the speaker xbox live itself do you have broadband do you have a router and a switch or hub if needed if the answers are both yes you need xbox live it is incredible buy this or the kit if you are just starting but do n't forget to start your account first with the free 2 months after you have live already renew with the subscription card
so far the item has worked excellent it looks very nice and was inastallation friendly i hope you keeep this item as i restore a lot of cars and this unit works well for me and is at a good price point thank you don snyde
i recently installed this unit into my 1995 geo prizm after the factory stereo lost its fm capabilities installation was a snap with the purchase of an adapter plate and power wire adapter i left the speakers from the previous radio in the car boston acoustics 5 '' in the front and jbl 6 '' in the rear am stations sound like the factory 's fm and the fm is so clear that i hear instruments in the music that i did n't hear before i must say that the dual unit lacks a low end unless you turn on the loudness '' and then it is adequate a large part of the problem is the jbl 's in the back i do not believe they are capable of cranking out bass the stations pull in great on both bands and there are plenty of stations to program 6 am and 18 fm i do n't know what the feature does in this unit it does n't seem to have an effect the cd player is very good very clear and has n't skipped when i am gone down bumpy roads and potholes there are claims of the brightness of the radio when driving at night well yes there is no question about the brightness it 's a nice blue and it does n't bother me a bit as a matter of fact it is easy to use the radio in the dark because the controls are easily seem and identified a weird feature '' about this radio is that when you have it turned off any button will turn it on any button ! this dual is worth every penny that i spent on it i did n't want to spend a whole lot of money for a radio in this old vehicle but i really got my money 's worth and more with this purchase
i liked the unit it is very well built materials and workmanship are close to perfect sound quality is also very good at least more than enough for a car player is quite fast it takes seconds to recognize the disk random play '' is not really random the sequence is always the same and very predictable controls are convinient radio reception is also very good the only issue which is very annoing blue leds highhlighing are extremely bright there is no way to dim them or swith off it 's hard to drive at the night time with the unit on i had to make a small black paper cover for it to get rid of this bright light
i was purchased this item for indian car the installation is very simple if you have a knowledge of installing such products then it is much more easier it plays all song formats without skipping is also good tuner is very good it tunes all stations bad regarding time display there is not time display in this item if you want to see current time you need ot click on disp button
ca n't ask for more clear sound nicely finished easy to use and the best part is the iplug just plug it and you are done your ipod does n't get power from the oultlet of the car better for ipod 's helth no interferience like fm modulators it does n't get any better for the price
i too was looking for an ipod connection for my saab that was original i could n't believe the price on this unit but the reviews convinced me anyway it was fairly easy to install took me an hour from start to finish all i needed were 12 solderless connectors and a wire tool i 've been using the unit for a week now and will agree with some reviews who say the lights are too bright great for daytime way too much for night i 've considered a couple options one was dark window tint overlays but i 've decided to alter the removable faceplate provided with the unit to fashion a cover i 'll slice the fp cover in half at the hinge giving me two covers some velcro and i 'll have a cover that will work at night set the unit how i like and place the fp cover over it using the velcro to secure should be a breeze to do i owned a 350 eclipse cd player and the dual does n't sound quite as good but the feature set price and ipod connector make up for the slight difference in sound quality the skip protection in the dual seems better than the eclipse all and all a great buy i 'm very happy with the dual
after reading reviews on this and other products i decided to go with the dual i got it from amazon for 79 and free shipping i 've been using it now for about a month and have not been disappointed by anything ! i was already expecting the ridiculously bright lights from the other reviews this stereo has so far been one of those purchases that keeps surprising me with it 's versatility and features i 've found that a quick perusal of the instructions was enough to be able to use almost all the important functions cd playback radio station presets radio scan eq customization switching between albums on a single disc mute external audio source plugin jack ipod or even a walkman etc the sound tends to be a little on the high and crisp end and i have to turn the bass eq up to 5 out of i think 8 to get a decent frequency range but it 's not bad enough to take away from the overall value of this gem overall i ca n't understand why this stereo was so cheap ! it 's way better than a pioneer model i bought a number of years back the have my little chevy thumping and i love the features of being able to pop 8 albums on a single disc and quickly switch between them this model is a gem and i would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a car player but who wants to spend less than 100 buy it
i have to agree with other posters here who praise the sound but ca n't stand the bright blue lights performance great ! it made the stock speakers in my ten year old corolla sound absolutely amazing much better than the much more expensive pioneer i installed in another vehicle a couple of years ago likewise the controls on the dual are straightforward and easy to use with the pioneer i had to get the manual out whenever i wanted to do something as simple as setting the clock no way to dim those damn blue lights though they are so bright that you ca n't see the control illumination at night i tried the trick of taking off the buttons but could n't get them out so i guess i 'm stuck with that
installation was easy with the correct harness and knowing your speaker config it took about 1 hour btw i have never install a car stereo before it has all the features you can think of from a player many small details like able to save preset volume and prefered eq and seperate them in fm mode or cd mode i am really impressed build in 200 watts amp creates a solid and deep sound with my factory speakers of course with a speaker upgrade and preamp it will sound alot better but this is really pretty good with no other modifications the is a blessing ever tried to play your with a fm modulator or tape adaptor they gernerally sound really distorted and at high volume the treble will crack the iplug is a simple plug that can plug into anything from the ubiquitous ipods to the cheap players you buy from the sound is always solid with no distortion and you can tap into the eq and amp to adjust the sound the bottom line is you really can not beat the price and quality of this inexpensive cd head unit i have no idea about the durability but i am really happy about it at the momen
the first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it does n't come with software for handhleds that person chose to buy it without and save some and then complained about having to pay extra for it because bought the wrong software package delorme did the right thing and offered us options i just ordered mine and i have no plans on using with a hh so i 'm very happy that i did n't have to buy the hh software just do n't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it nemerous people have highly recommended this to me although i have heard that ms mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option storing data points without a connection to a computer is awesome i will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route elevation etc too bad it is only in
item was received in good on time and works well
i use this in my laptop with microsoft street with gps it works great when you have multiple usb with only one port
for the time being as i am in the process of purchasing a new computer the usb device will work for my laptop taking into consideration the fact that i do n't have powered up devices attached to it that would draw from the laptop
it works well but be aware that it is usb 1.1 only i am not using it for my epson which is usb 2
cool ! i can expand more flexible from single peripheral to be quadruplet i can plug flashdisk mouse external and digital camera in same time worth money for usefull gadget
works just excellent only thing is that a longer cord between the hub itself and the connection into the computer would be nice
we bought this device with the express intent of capturing old vhs tapes and putting them into dvd format for that it works and the bundled software meets the need however ! this vhs to dvd is a long and slow process so do n't kid yourself into thinking that the hw decoding in this box is going to make that a process the actual making '' of the dvd movie is still very time consuming as is the editing i 'm not so impressed with windvd but my son who did most of the editing preferred its ease of use over the ulead product which was also included we had trouble with one of the usb ports even though all of the ports on the pc purchased less than a year ago are supposed to be high speed 2.0 usb but using another port allowed the device to be found and connected i wish there were some way to tell if frames are getting dropped some video was pretty choppy and did n't look that way on the vhs but i could n't quite figure out what was causing the problem and it did n't repeat on later uses so far we 're happy we got it if the arrives too much struggle i 'll be even happier
i just make it very short ! i 'm very satisfied with plextor it is just i expected to be ! all my home videos are digitalized with no problem at all i even recorded shows from my tv and everything working as it must be ! i suggest warmly to use this converter
excellent product all my vcrs are dying of old age i am converting my home library to dvd with very good results once you figure our ulead and windvd conversion is just a matter of time spent running each video
i purchased the plextor converter on advice of nero they claimed that it would be compatible with their software after i plugged it in and tried to convert my tape the system froze that happened several times i wrote about this to nero they asked me to send them a report i did that that was almost two weeks ago i am still waiting for a reply as they are notorious with their responses you may want to contact nero directly however i doubt if it will work in future you may want to put some sort of safeguards in place referring to the software vendors with the description of your product s otherwise i am very satisfied with the service i have received from you as i bought many other items through you martha pelensk
one of the reviewers said that this product records the video as an file and compromises the quality of the video because it is not saved as an avi file actually it does save the video as an avi file ! the problem with avi files is that they can not be displayed on a tv set you have to convert them into a format that can be read by the dvd player and displayed on your current tv thus when you want to put that avi file on a dvd it is converted to so is as good as it gets right now for normal digital video for editing you should leave your video in avi format because editing causes further degradation of the video i have used this product for about a year now and it works great i initially had some problems with quality but once i updated to the latest drivers from the companies website it worked fine this is probably why some of these reviewers gave it bad marks because they did n't download the newest drivers available i got this to convert my old vcr tapes to dvds and it worked perfectly the windvd software that is included is easy to use and works great my computer os is window xp remember to look at the most recent reviews of this product many of the latest drivers may not have been available for the earliest reviewers great product !
i really love these speakers the fidelity of the bass is terrific as per come on closer '' by jem say my regular system has magnaplanar speakers with a subwoofer and this system gives me much the same effect as the maggies that the music is n't coming from a single point more like being in a concert setting than hearing sound from a box quibbles the volume controls are nearly impossible to find but that makes them inconspicuous once you 've found them ! the subwoofer is not tiny in terms of fitting under a desk 12 '' diameter if you ca n't imagine yourself fidgeting with the fishbowl in stockinged feet you might pass on this item if you think you can handle that however you 're going to love these speakers
these speakers are both stylish and sound great a nice compliment to my first mac computer
i got the soundsticks to use as a home stereo in a small room i was n't expecting superb sound quality and the soundsticks really suprised me with the full and detailed sound they produce overall the product is great value for money and the space it takes up my only gripe is that there is no off button on them so the only way to power off is to unplug them i 'm not sure how much power they use when idle but not being able to power off is definitely a down side if you 're energy conscious
i just received my soundsticks yesterday and could not be happier with their performance i am using them to listen to streaming audio on my pc from a radio station in italy that plays jazz and the nuances of that style of music are well suited to the sound sticks the sleekness of the design is superb as well the nice price makes this purchase a home run
i first saw these speakers at the apple store and i really liked the sound and the look i went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them as long as you have a decent soundcard these speakers really are great i have had no problem with them at all they look really cool they 're loud they 're small the woofer gives you a lot of bass which you can turn down and the sound from the speakers is clear buy these
i 've owned several sets of the original soundsticks and purchased this set for my wife 's new intel imac as always the sound is amazing and plentiful with the subwoofer providing strong thumping bass and the sticks emitting crystal clear highs we both love music and we often fire up itunes on the computer in the den and the volume is good enough to fill the house our friends are always amazed at the sound these soundsticks put out i 'm sure there are audiophiles out there who nitpick the output but if you are just a regular joe who enjoys your music and appreciates good clear and strong sound i promise that you will not be disappointed with soundsticks ii
i 'm not one to explain or understand most audio specs compare systems or buy the most expensive audio components there are this 3 piece speaker system was recommended by a coworker and the user reviews certainly helped in the decision making process still i was doubtful of course as i love my gizmos and the price was under 120.00 what kind of quality could this be for that price let me tell you i am blown away especially considering the price ! roughly 113.00 shipping and tax included and my whole room rocks ! fyi i listen to everything from marvin gaye nine inch nails acoustic to beethoven it plugs in via the same adapter as your headphones so there are no delays in the subwoofer like what usually occurs with the usb connected woofers the plastic is a tough and heavy material so do n't worry about them cracking under normal use and since the sticks are tall the base of the sticks are made of a heavy rubbery material so they wo n't fall over or slide unless your on top of beer kegs the right sound stick contains the volume adjustment sensors that take some time to get used to considering most computers have 2 other sources of volume control operating system 's and the music player you use i call them sensors because they do n't move they are like those cool lamps that brighten and dim when touched overall if you a person who wants a nice sound system for your computer that you can hear from a few rooms away and are not sure what to buy or how much to spend this is the way to go
the quality of the sound is very good indeed i would say crystal clear they were also a very good bargain the design is also very different the only disadnantage i have noticed is that they do not have a on off switch i use them to listen to music classical or modern either from my hp laptop or from my i strongly recommend the harman 's for room use
the dlo action jacket is a must have for all ipod owners that workout or are on the go the armband is the perfect way to secure your ipod when you are running or lifting i recommend the dlo action jacket to everyone
i got this jacket a month into having my ipod i had to buy it because i had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when i pulled the ipod out of that case it was easy to drop one time i did drop it and within a month of owning the ipod i had it in fro repairs this case protected my ipod of another 11 months just fine my complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out it is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface it will protect your pod though
this case is made of nice material unfortunately the ipod fits rather loosely in the case also one of the velcro flaps on the top of the case covers the hold button on the ipod the case takes away from the ipod 's good looks and slightly hinders usage of the buttons it does n't do what i wanted it to do stay out of the way and simply protect the player however the case would be great to use just for jogging as it comes with a belt and clip that hold the ipod firmly
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
works great good coverage had a small problem setting it due to changeing my isp from cable to dsl called tech support and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptop it 's been two months since installation without any problems whatsoever
we currently have the linksys for our home network it 's been working great for about 4 years now but we 've now run out of ports i did some research on the 8 port product from linksys but the reviews were mixed the reviews were mixed for similar competing products also so i took the route of getting the to expand our existing home network i just plugged it into the network and it just worked out of the box no configuration needed it 's also very tiny i highly recommend the product
linksys tech support assured me that their were no limitations to this gizmos ability to route ethernet signals sure enough i plugged it in and it 's functioning exactly as i hoped our internet comes from a cable modem from that i ran the ethernet cable to the airport extreem which acts as a wireless router and it also has 1 out port for ethernet which i connected the switch to off the switch i am running a printer laserwriter pro 630 and a desk top i also have 3 wireless computers on the network and all are running all can access the internet i can print from any computer and fileshare between the whole lot i could n't ask for more
i have nothing to report that is the device has performed flawlessly in the years i have owned it i subjected this thing to almost every scenario except mac read on i used it at my office at a major research university where i connected among other things a vintage circa 1999 windows xp desktop a dell inspiron 6000 laptop with xp two variants of the dell dual xeon workstations running redhat and fedore core an ibm thinkpad laptop running xp a custom built amd athlon running every major linux distribution except debian as well as xp and a custom built amd dual core machine running suse 10. network cards ranged from to 0 and 4 year old netgear cards i used cables from 3 to 30 feet long and connected this to both a brand new wall jack and a retrofitted jack in a cold war era building finally the room this equipment operated in was subjected to temperatures from 55 f to 110 f as my office was not air conditioned during the summer and it was colder outside at 100 degrees the above computers made a lot of heat we had major power problems which did n't faze this thing one bit but were able to ruin more than one expensive apc ups unit oh and i downloaded at least 100 gb through this card during this period
this little baby is just hook up my desktop wireless ap wired router together it just works nothing else tips if you 'd like to use overseas buy nokia ac adaptor model it just works with nokia phone charger that 's all no question aske
what else do you need to know you plug in your pcs and a cable to your router and go i used a netgear hub for years replaced it with this linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately
i have other linksys routers and switches in my house and this works great in conjuction with them i have never even had to power anything off the data flows nicely and smoothly
the product works perfectly the only problem is the manual only includes directions for the most common setups to use one port as an uplink '' to a router for example you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled 1 '' and then leave port 2 '' open the directions do not state this and i had to call linksys to get it to work other than that it is fast reliable and small perfect
installation and network was a snap the fifth port is really the upstream connection so you get four clients not five
purchased this product lookig for a switch that allowed me to connect multiple systems to my home network and it does that function exceptionally well i had multiple printers pc 's to connect and this switch handled multiple connection speeds flawlessly stylish and extremely small it fits on my desktop without taking up very much space approx 4.5 '' wide x 3.5 inches deep all cables and connectors are on the back the front panel led 's for each port display duplex and connect speed the only thing that needs improvement on this switch is the user guide '' included with the product there are 6 ports on this ports and an 'uplink ' port but use of the uplink port disbles the use of port 5 leaving 4 ports for your peripheral devices this is a bit confusing as the device is advertised as a 5 port workgroup switch a quick trip to downloading the guide ' which was not included with the product did a much better job of explaining the use of the uplink and ethernet port overall buy this product if you need a small switch for additional devices ca n't be beat for the price in my opinion
i purchased this printer with the intent to use it for both photo printing and regular text printing photos look great and print relatively quickly but i had a problem with white streaks when printing text i ended up calling canon support and they sent me a new printer head for free since the printer is still under warranty i 've had no problems since i give the printer a high rating mainly because i was very satisified with their tech support
my brother has the netgear super g 108 pc card for his notebook and it works great so after i thought my dell notebook internal wireless chip died i decided to order a notebook adapter for it instead of getting another netgear i decided to go with the cardbus adapter my first experience with a product the works great plugged the card into the adapter slot turned on the notebook minutes configurations and wola i got on the internet the card works flawlessly without any signal dropped or any compatibility problem with my westell router i notice the wireless signal is stronger and the connection is faster than the notebook internal wireless adapter or the linksy adapter which i used prior to obtaining the the supports wep wpa security encryption and comes with an intuitive and easy to use configuration utility
i could n't find this adapter locally so i turned to naturally i found it the price was right i received the advertised rebate and the product works as advertised what more can you want
all i have used this card to connect to various routers and it works well the extreme g mode is problematic to enable sometimes new drivers are available make sure you the right one how about having an automatic update command instead of letting the user figure out which card version he has bria
the main reason i got this card is because it working in linux it has an atheros chipset and it delivers it works great and the range is awesome for windows users it works great in xp as well overall i am very satisfied with this wireless card
my setup dell latitude intel chip win xp pro wireless router with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna enabled the wep feature i unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in windows found the new card and did its thing not only was i was able to get on the internet immediately but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that i could n't 'see ' with my cisco aironet card this i sort of expected but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers the cd installed just fine but when i went to the site to check for an updated driver it said i was i ran windows update and it claimed i had an updated driver available for my new card i 've never had a problem with 's website or customer service while we 're on the subject so i was a bit taken aback that microsoft was ahead of 's site either way install the card and get onto the internet then have windows update check for possible updates be sure to enable the encryption feature if you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors ca n't go snooping through your stuff or worse lift the signal and ultimately your personal information i 've had no problems with my current i highly recommend this card to bring your
i decided to dust off a old laptop winbook the other day and install ubuntu on it i selected this card because of the atheros chipset i ca n't believe how easy it was to get it working i plugged it in installed ubuntu and the new os recognized the card with in minutes i was on the internet thanks to my neighbor 's open wifi after a few hours of reading some wiki 's and messages i had wpa running and my new '' linux laptop was on my network piece of cake ! great card and great chipset
this wireless wireless airplusxtremeg adapter is amazing the first amazing thing is that it seems to lose your connection all the time this seems to be because of some problem has with authentication '' if you want yours to work turn off authentication once you have it running reliably it is amazingly fast i run on a cable modem and get about 1.1 megabytes per second on a wired connection normally and yet i have exceeded that with my airplusxtremeg about 1.15 my point is that it works like a wired connection without the hassle of wires but with the added hassle of needing to set it up exactly right this doesn 's seem to be a problem if you do n't use security but with security be prepared to visit at least one forum for tips on i recommend they have many people who are experienced with this adapter and the routers that are used with it
this is very well designed it give you 4 usb port but two on opposite sides this is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides you webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right the cord that plug in from the hub to the computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the hub in all kind of angles it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires it also works great if you jsut want to charge you usb devices on the go it come with a plug in ac adapter so you do n't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices
this review pertains specifically to the targus 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub the cord is about 2.5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin
pros small cute comes with a power adaptor i have 6 devices hooked up to it including 2 usb hard drives and it works fine without the adapter a big plus for me most hubs would not work with this setup usb 2.0 1.1 6 devices hooked up 3 low speed and 3 high speed all work very well runs cool cons not sure why but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and ports on the other this is dumb if you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward all ports should be on the back and leds on the front here the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you do n't see them the hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated overall the best hub i 've ever had and i tried many
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue
you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires i keep my cpu under the table only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price
this hub takes care of old power issues i had with smaller unpowered hubs it is handling my pda usb jump drive high capacity external drive and printer and i still have 3 more ports and i have n't had any usb power alerts from my computer since i added this hub it does what it says
i have been using the sansa player now for almost a year it 's a great item especially for the price was very easy to download my music and set up i purchased a better brand of earphones seeing i would be using mine mostly on an airplane it holds more than enough songs i am going to purchase one for my granddaughter for her christmas present this year
as you have read other reviews the earphones could be better sometimes you will hear music out of both sometimes one or the other the only issue i have with it is if someone downloads music on to it with another computer you can not pull the songs off with your computer maybe i am missing something or doing something wrong but over all it 's not bad
i purchased the sansa player for a hinking trip and i have to say it works great the only complaint that i would have is that the unit is a bit bulk for todays standards but not to bad if you are looking for a player than this unit is a great value ! plus it comes in larger memory sizes and a built in radio to boot ! the single aaa battery that the unit takes goes a long way too
i purchased sandisk about 2 months ago and so far i am very satisfied with its performance i was looking for a chepear alterantive to ipod as i am not an avid music listner and sandisk was the just the right product loading music on it is real simple using windows media player battery life is excellent i also use it to tune into fm channels while at gym or when i want to catch up with days news at work the fm reception is quite good for something this small without an antenna i even have dropped it atleast on three occassion and so far it seems to work just fine touch wood ! ! overall a great product for its price !
this is wonderful i really like it very portable and saves alot of songs
beautiful electronic item bright colours easy plug and play
i have about 5 players so far this one is the best the battery life is excellent has plenty of space for easy to use
i will buy an ipod in due time but for right now the sandisk sansa is the perfect one start off with i did n't want to spend a lot of money for an item i never use before i just want to listen to music without carrying player and the fancy stuff examples video viewing combination cell phone the is easy to program your music make sure you have windows xp on your desktop computer or laptop this player is also a recorder and has fm radio the items that come with this are instruction booklet mini cd to on computer system i was able to program music without this cd plastic cover velco strip earphones and the connection cord usb simple and basic this is the one ps because the sandisk sansa does n't look expensive pickpockets and theives are not trying to to steal it like an ipod
i just got my mouse today i was ecstatic about the performance i had initial problems installing the mouse but after i unplugged it and plugged it in again the problems went away i have to agree with my other comrades from this site this is the best mouse for the price and i have no problems whatsoever except for the look which i thought was the result from damage from shipping but it was designed like that so i have no complaints
i had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it it had gotten very good reviews ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some highly recommend it
the mouse is perfect for games i use it to play et and is great the software provided by logitech is configurable in all ways
i was using a prior to getting this there is a slight upgrade in performance from the 510. the ability to adjust the sensitivity on the fly was n't that useful it was hard to adjust to the different levels and it would change the sens setting in game so i set the mouse software to the highest level and adjusted the in game settings to where it felt good the biggest difference i felt is it 's easier to make longer range shots i 'm sure because of the higher resolution of the 518 over the 510
alright i got this mouse to replace the shoddy touchpad on my laptop this thing is certainly worlds better than any touch pad lol what made this mouse appeal to me over any other is that the traditional logitech shape of it is very comfortable to me the internet navigation buttons are very conventient and the high resolution optics that you can switch on the fly since i use my laptop for playing games i 'm a fan of the gaming mouse and after using it for so long i just ca n't go back to a normal resolution mouse without cringing the provided a cost effective alternative over the since i would be taking it around with me it would matter less if it got broken in transit or solen also the button layout on my laptop is different than my desktop keyboard so i wanted both the forward and back internet navigation buttons my only gripes are mostly that this is n't a lol there 's no dpi indicator the resolution buttons are n't ergonomically placed the forward one feels like it 's a mile away when you try to press it and as a user of wireless mice for so long and a fully weighted i like heavy mice and the is just too light for me to really feel natural with it i hate to say it because the mouse performs great but it just feels cheap because of how light it is so as a portable gaming mouse i give this a 4. if you 're looking for a cost effective gaming mouse or something for graphics design this is a good bet but if you want to go all out buy something higher end because you will be more satisfied with the higher end product
it 's cool to own SMILE i 'm a die hard though i 've not had time to serioulsy exploit its high just using it in with default settings is buy it only for games and all for desktop use there are better looking less expensive options
this mouse plays great for my games like cs source and 1942. it is real nice to be able to change the mouse speed in game which helps a lot if your playing games like 1942 and you need to go from first person to flying a jet however the reason i give it a 4 stars is that after playing for a few hours the mouse 's design is such that it has a sharp bend right where your right ring finger rests and it can get to be hurting especially if you play a lot of fps type games where your holding and moving the mouse constantly
i 've gone through about 6 different mice and each one had their pros and cons mostly cons i finally found the and trust me you do n't know what you 're missing until you 've used it how did i find it on there are tons of threads about what 's the best mouse '' this mouse came up so frequently that it seemed like a this is the first time i can use a mouse and never have to worry about unexpected friction or hiccups it controls with extreme precision and ease at first it was a little hard for me to get used to the shape and size since it feels different from other mice i 've used but once i got used to it it 's flawless i am also a pretty avid gamer and since i got this mouse my performance has gone up noticeably in fact that 's the reason i got this mouse to begin with my biggest weakness was my inability to consistently click quickly on small units in battle with the those kinds of dumb problems go away another thing i love is that even if i used it for hours my hand feels completely rested and fresh no more taking quick hand breaks stretching it out or what not it 's also very easy to customize the speed and feel of the mouse using the software i 've read some complaints about it but i ca n't see any way to improve it coupled with my steelpad s s mousepad it 's so much more fun to get on the computer like upgrading car audio you really do n't know what you 're missing until you get rid of your outdated junk and try the best
i am very happy with my purchase the ipod is so expensive and not nearly as efficient my sister has one and i have 3 times as many songs on my bean i have found that even dropping it several times im clumsy that despite what i originally thought it has withheld very well i do not like the fact that you pretty much are forced to use sony software but it is quick and easy to use
short and quick software is easy to use but because sony uses atrac you ca n't play the songs on another program windows etc you downloaded or saved from a cd to the sony program but the program is very easy to use the player itself is very small including the buttons i purchased it strictly for the gym and long plane trips it hold a ton of songs why you need more that that i do n't know it also has a fm stereo receiver so it is cool as well in total it is compact and easy to use perfect for the gym running fanatic
great player but the earbud set that comes with it is lousy
i purchased this item initially because of the price compared to the ipod 's i love it ! my husband has the video ipod and his battery needs charged every day i have never had to charge this player yet ! it goes for 50 i ordered the mini sony speakers for it so i can listen to it at work on my desk or anywhere the only downside is that sony quit making the armband for it so i am having a hard time finding a holder for it it fit my needs perfectly
i use it when i and it really keeps me in stride my only problem is that amazon does not have the arm bands but i hope that they will have some in soon
the walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses the sound is excellent but i use an older set of sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set the unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time it is quite small and the only disadvantage i 've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket
i just ordered the second one for our family it 's the sony player to join our househould they 've been very dependable and they 're easy to use the software is simple the sound is great and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time my teenagers girls love that they come in colors and they 're different than what most of their friends have mom loves that they 're affordable
this is the greatest little player ! ! ! the sound is great good bass the size is very convenient and everybody who see it wants one it fits in a pocket has an armband option or a key ring option even little speakers as an option i 've taken it on so many trips there is a caution though even though the software is good for windows plus or better you can not download from the web unless you have windows xp
this is my first portable player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls i did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what hold '' meant on the screen but other than that very nice little product good price and very easy to use
well to begin with i am a complete ipod hater the whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features does n't sit right with me but after robbing my bro of his for so long since i had none it was time to get something of my own i chose this walkman bean player the size is sick ! fits between a few fingers also it is sony a trusted company unlike apple who will give you the runaround the navigation and menu is so simple i did n't read the manual and i figured it out the only thing i read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio but that is negligible anyhow i looooove it great bargain sound investment
for those of you who bought minidisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording this product is wonderful especially good for recording lectures voice lessons etc it works quite well with the mono mike or you could use an external one one of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike you toggle which setting it is in the settings section i record my radio shows by plugging in the from the station 's tape deck to my iriver for those who recorded live music with their minidiscs it 's a little trickier you have to set the record input before you ca n't change it on the fly i 've recorded live dj shows with the and agc on of course the booming bass distorts horribly but overall an easy record of the show very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show i 've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results a bit of trial and error which i 'm still refining with later iriver products the single aa batter lasts a good long time summer school involves 2 classes and i can record several days of them before battery is low if the battery runs out during recording fear not the file is saved ! the negatives are the requirement to go through the special iriver music program but there are now firmware updates that will change your iriver into the typical usb external drive files are recorded in a file which one then converts to a file after transfer to your computer i do n't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the file but you ca n't trasnfer files off your iriver even if you made them yourself so do n't think you can use this to transfer files from one computer to another also the molding where the input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some rca to '' adaptors so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way i 've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day whether just playing or recording classes i 'm only just starting to have some trouble with the button after so many presses it 's starting to wear out but it 's still working reliably i just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention i have the model which is great i was able to record a radio show marathon i produced with it previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs i 'm quite happy with iriver and plan on buying from them in the future
it got to me quickly even before the estimated arrival date in perfect condition it blows away my last player and best of all microsoft apple do n't have their hands in this device no playsforsure no that 's the best part i pity all of you with and playsforsure players you 'll never know what it 's like to not be a corporate lacky unless you get an player like this one it 's worth the price
i had this exact iriver and when i loaned it out it got lost so he offered to replace it with even a better '' player that would show photos etc i asked for an exact replacement because i love everything about this player it fits my needs perfectly the features i love are that it has both voice and radio record and you can also record from your stereo or cassette or whatever audio source using the feature it has tons of space more than i 've ever used and the small size and sound quality is great ! i have seen some people write that they did n't like the buttons or had problems with turning it off and on accidentally but i personally have never had that problem as long as i slide the hold button over to the lock position i like that it gives a cord to hang it around my neck or to put it on my however i rarely use the armband the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can not view photos on it even tho you can store and transfer them i personally do n't need that feature but others may prefer it i love my iriver
very good player can do everything you need good for sport joging the only thing i miss a little bit is rds feature also if you upload songs on it you can download it back to pc to friends pc so ca n't be used as a usb key well i guess it 's not the main feature but would be nice
this player is great all around small compact size with sport arm band included makes a whiz ! the only draw back i 've found so far is that is does n't play files the sound through my upgraded sony headphones is awesome and equalizer can be set to your desired mix the battery lasts at least 1.5 weeks with daily use lp chicag
i 'm very pleased with this player it may nota have a very big storage but it seems to be enough of course it depends of every person i think it 's better than any other player of 1 gb got fm record from almost any device uses aa batteries it 's got a great sound the only con is that it is not recognized as a removable disk it needs the driver !
i wanted a digital music player and found this to be a terrific option it plays a number of different formats and includes a lanyard which is nice when commuting on the train or for plane travel i have only used alkaline batteries so far and have had excellent battery life the menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu it 's pretty easy i have also enjoyed the built in fm tuner and have not any trouble with reception even on a moving commuter train the sound quality is very good i 've been using 128 bitrate songs so far the software for transferring music is pretty easy to use although i did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue the included earbuds are n't the most comfortable especially since i already lost the foam padding but i will probably get a better pair anyway they do sound good though also the included cases are pretty cheesy and i did n't even bother with them a little hint one thing i did not like was that because of the location of the on button the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket to combat this simply turn the hold on the unit wo n't turn on accidentally when it 's on
for the longest time i really didnt think 12 a month was worth this kind of radio but after buying the and getting it all hooked up in my car i soon changed my mind biggest thing for me is hardly any dj talking they really keep the music going i noticed on a couple other reviews this was not the case i listen to only the rock stations so i cant comment on other stations i live in the seattle area and using the fm modulator really sucked every station had static i found an audio input cable online to fit my car stereo for a direct connection and oh man what a difference ! ! crystal clear ! i did have to play with the bass and treble a bit to get the best sound and since i have a i used the fader a couple of clicks to the front away from the sub and really got it sounding great it doesnt sound as good as a cd but much better than regular radio so i bought another car kit and i have the boom box for in the house i did notice the unit getting a little warm but nowhere near hot
this unit performs well both in the car and home it performs best at home as you can plug it right into your stereo using a unused fm frequency this might work ok in rural areas but in urban areas how long is the fm frequency unused '' in my experience living in chicago not very far then you get static and fumble to change the frequency to another unused station plus you have this thing hanging out from your dash very noticable expecially to theives so it 's then one more then you have to remove and hide or take with you if you want sirius in your car invest in a head unit and be done with it this unit works great at home and if you get an extra kit you can take it to your office and hook it up there it has a remote and i 've had no problems with it whatsoever at home like i said for the car i ended up getting a separate head unit and would advise people to do the same
i think this is a very good receiver a number of people have complained about issues with the wireless fm modulator and the static that is causes i would say that there is some static at times but most of the time i have not had this issue however i will clarify that statement by noting that if you are traveling long distances you most likely will have to switch the fm frequency a few times during the trip in my case it was a two hour trip from sacramento to the bay area as the station you are set to will likely not be free for that entire time however it is very easy to switch the frequency so i was able to adjust it without any difficulties as for the receiver itself i like the compactness of it and it does not take long to figure out how to go through the various menus save stations etc i did not care much for the suction cup that is part of the car kit although it worked fine on my car window i really did n't want it there so i actually just use the cradle and place it in one of my cupholders but this is a personal preference i would definitely recommend this receiver to my friends
i bought the boom box and the car kit the fm modulator has a much better reception than when i have it in the boom box at home unlike others i have perfect reception with the wrieless least for now i 'm going ahead and buying the home aentenna to get a better reception for when i use the boombox at home all in all great buy and i ca n't wait for stern
i got this for hubby and me over the summer we used it for our trip to rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it we have a tape deck in the car and used it a cassette adaptor we had not problems whatsoever in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter i did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next but i do n't think anybody can improve upon that i had the same problem my itrip we chose sirius for several reasons i liked the classic vinyl station my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007. the only problem i had was i could n't read the red lettering in the daylight the sunglasses on but i did n't give them less than 5 stars because of this this is the way to go plus it has a suction mount not a permanent mount also if you look on ebay someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat ! ! definitely go satellite the music is great and no commercials depending on the stations
this sandisk realy works to save a lot of information in one stick it 's very handy thank you
this was the first flash drive i bought and i liked it enough to buy a second one i 've since given both of them away as i am using a other brand with a retractable plug in however i 'm buying a few more of these right now so that i will have them on hand to give to student advisees who really need one as they are so inexpensive the only thing that keeps me from giving it a rating is that the caps are easy to lose altho each drive comes with two extra caps which helps the slim line also makes it very easy to carry or store and it fits easily into usb ports that might be a tight squeeze for other brand flash drives
works good small and comes with handy little stickers to put on so you can write contact info in case you lose it though slightly costl
it 's little it holds a bunch of data it 's so easy to use even my copilot can understand it it 's the perfect way to transport lots of data in a really small package throw those floppy disks away forever ! if north korea could make missiles the way sandisk makes flash drives we 'd all be in deep kimchee
just the like the reviewer below i accidentally put my cruzer through the washer and the dryer i pulled it out after my clothes finished drying a i was sure i had firstly waterlogged it and secondly fried it when i got to work and plugged it into my computer it started right up no problems whatsoever i do n't know whether or not it would survive it i did it again but for this one time it performed brilliantly thanks cruzer !
i 've had this device for two years just today i sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry not on purpose the thing still works ! ! i will not however try sending it into the dryer though beause i 'm pretty sure that would fry this thing
what else can i say other than i 'm impressed ! thank you everyone for placing your reviews here that helped me to decide on this item for data storage it was hard for me to believe something could be so quick and easy to use but now i 'm convinced
very portable comes with three different colored caps and a lanyard easy to use just plug into usb port and save your data shipped quicker than expected cheaper than local store no shipping and tax no complaints
i have had no problems with the drive i like the small size
i have n't had the chance to use this plan yet but i believe it is a good price for the item that i bought and i trust that if it does what it says that it is a good thing
replacement plan here a month before product finally receive
absolutely fantastic my recorder stopped formatting my disks i had used the recorder approximately 1 yr after using maxell 's dvd cleaner disk all is back to normal great product even a simpleton can use it follow on screen instructions and you are home free
i 've had my dvd player for about a year and use this a lot haven t had any problems out of my dvd player yet
's hub works perfectly you plug it into a usb port and it 's ready to roll it 's that simple
no matter how many usb port i had i always seemed to need more i had ports on my computer more on my monitor even two on my keyboard and still i needed more after researching a number of hubs i chose this one and it is great i am not good at the technical workings of a computer so i was worried that the installation would be hard or that there would be conflicts with other hardware nothing like that happened i followed the set up instructions it took 10 minutes at most and i was in business right now i have four usb devices plugged into the hub and all work just as they should i have not had trouble with anything i added to the hub and miraculously i have three open ports to use later this hub does exactly what it should with no fuss or bother
i purchased this hub back in september i plugged it in and i 'm running two printers and my mouse off of it at the moment i 've had no problems it does n't take up too much room even with 7 ports my only complaint is n't with amazon it 's with after i sent in the rebate info i got a card from saying my request was n't valid because i had n't purchased it from the right store but i called them and in about 10 minutes i had the problem cleared up and had my rebate a week later i highly recommend keeping copies of all the rebate info just in
i got this hub to deal with the overflow of usb 2.0 devices i have been accumulating it came promptly the rebate was great and it is working beautifully ! i really recommend it
this hub has worked exactly as anticipated i 've had it for a month or so now and it is hooked up to my laptop i 've got a wireless mouse epson printer ipod fuji digital camera all plugged into it it performs amazingly when syncing my ipod i even had it unplugged from the power source and it performed without issue i was hesitant to purchase due to some of the reviews but it has been perfect for my needs !
i work with a laptop computer and i have 3 external harddrives to backup my data other than that i have several usb devices i have used all of them at the same time this hub works perfectly and it just takes one usb port i had one before that used two ports but this one uses only one giving you room for another device if you work with a lot of usb devices this is your produc
i bought this tv for use in a computer room kid 's playroom and it works nicely i looked at several similar models and was drawn to this one for the price and picture quality i do have two complaints my dish network universal remote wo n't operate the tv when i called dish network they said that it could n't be programmed my other complaint is the sound quality it is really bad i ended up buying some bose computer speakers and they plugged right in a vast improvement overall i am pleased with this purchase
i am a dentist who uses these monitors as tv 's for my patients to view while having dental procedure done i have been very happy with them there is a headphone jack which i use for patients who do n't want to hear the drilling i 've only had them for about a month but so far they have been great
guess you can sometimes pick a good one over hundreds of bad ones i might say i was lucky or for the price this litte lcd is worth the price paid this lcd is filling 2 pairs of shoes very nicely it 's used as a kitchen tv and used as a computer very satisfied with the tv very clear and great good back lighting not dull or dim as some other lcd 's i 've seen sound is ok but a little thin for my liking so i added some cheap amplified speakers which really great as a computer monitor just as clear and functional as my high end hp refreshes at with no issues would i buy or another perhaps but i would test it out before the purchase if at all possible as there are some bad apples in every overall my purchase of this lcd tv was a complete success for my
at my house during rain storms there will often be a quick flash of the lights as a branch somewhere falls on the power lines that type of event would always cause my pc to turn off and i could loose quite a bit of work or even problems on the hard drive this little device has keept that from happening for some time i am very pleased the battery that is in it does not keep the best time '' estimates for battery life but knowing that the short spikes or loss of power will not cause me issues makes it worth the price
this is a great product i bought it after losing my old computer to intermittent power one more time than i was able to revive the pc the new apc back ups has work flawlessly since i installed it several weeks ago and has already intervened for 3 power losses and 19 instances of noisy power the apc control panel says i have 45 minutes of estimated battery time with my compaq presario and 19 '' flat panel monitor i think i will get another for my television and vcrs
first of all why do you want a power ups there are some very good reasons 1 you never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout 2 you want to work with clean power only 3 you want to monitor your pc power 4 you want to prevent your pc from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection the first rule about ups is to never trust the insurance claim get your pc insured elsewhere these companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims i have a pc running some very high specifications with over six usb devices lcd monitor printer and ethernet equipment with everything on at the same time i have never gone above of usage and average between and when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks even though i have a power supply unit psu i will be upgrading to a psu because it is better quality model the way i can monitor how many watts i use is with ups software and hardware so the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using the short answer to this is you do n't know until you install the ups and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time you need to estimate what it is i would say a domestic pc not a server would use max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on as soon as we add things like another pc or several printers or several monitors then we can start to overload a ups this brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any ups overloading and balancing the overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the ups capacity overloading does two things it can in theory eventually damage the ups and it voids the warranty most ups are but there are and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one pc setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups for a network so check the ups rating what ups you choose depends on how much you want to load on it next thing you need to check with the ups is if it comes with a usb connection if it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your pc and the ups comes with software now if the ups has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off ups sound alarms controlling how your ups handles a blackout how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation if it sounds an alarm or not if it run self tests data collection and monitoring notifications and sensitivity settings if the ups does not come with a usb connection and software then you probably should be looking for an ups designed for computer use rather than a ups for equipment most ups have led indicators that tell you the status of the unit the next thing to understand is that testing your ups is not done by breaking it out of the box connecting it to the mains plugging your pc in and then turning off the house 's power with the circuit breaker you must charge the ups first ! so read the instructions usually you must attach the battery to the ups plug it in firmly ! and wait before using it then perform the test using the software first ! then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the pc stays up usually a ups is programmed to shutdown your pc if the blackout lasts for a few seconds nearly all ups models with a usb connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the pc should hold for on the ups battery most ups devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem this is important because power surges on a ups that do not have this protection can damage a pc through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the pc somehow this is nasty problem with the degree of security that a ups can provide if it does n't have this function then it is not going to provide 100 surge protection with a pc that is networking a ups pc to another pc without ups can also increase the risk of surge protection problems it is not recommend that you network a ups pc to a pc unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue one last thing is that some ups have input regions on the ups for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot this is everything you need to know about an ups before you choose one it is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the ups and making sure it provides you with what you need the two top brands are apc and belkin
after losing a computer to a power surge i purchased the apc for my new computer i am runninig a tower pc with a 17 '' lcd monitor i have approx 15 minutes of battery runtime on my system the software that is very easy to install manage saves any open programs that i am running safely shuts down my computer when the battery gets to within 5 minutes of running out of power if i am away from it money well spent ! you do n't need to spend a fortune on larger units unless you want a longer runtime on battery
fantastic take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality
i have been using 3 1 and 1 card with my 2.1 megapixel camera that got me about 648 photos which has been great for vacations etc with the purchase of a new 7 megapixel camera i found that my photo storage dropped to about 202 photos which was definitely not enough with the card i can take a minimum of 650 photos without changing cards with my existing cards that totals at about 850 photos that number goes up if i use my macro or supermacro settings they drop the image size to the medium setting i have had no problems with any of my compact flash cards all of them being sandisk all have worked consistently and without issue
how many pictures will it store it is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about well considering i worked in the memory industry for over 7 years i can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as i have since changed industries the sandisk compactflash card type i like most cards will store on average 2275 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera 1706 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera 1024 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera 819 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera and 640 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera these numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality jpeg setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera one last thing to consider when buying a card do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available a card should be an investment you need to consider quality reliability and speed with a card of this capacity worse case scenario would be you taking this card and only this card on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted then what do you do purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button i truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs
i have had this cf card for nearly a year a year ago it cost nearly 300 boy those cf memory prices have dropped ! and it has worked without incident where i use it for storage on my ipaq pda it does not appear to cause a significant power drain on my ipaq battery so it must be a fairly efficient chip the write speed of this chip is roughly 40 slower than a sandisk ultra ii cf which is preferrable for digital cameras for reliable storage and backup applications though this cf is now an excellent value
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
i have had excellent results transferring my vhs tapes movies etc to memorex discs i have a philips dvd and it will only record on discs i have been through several other manufacturers discs and none were as reliable as memorex and of course philips i ran into a problem recording on the disc however that was due to a problem with the recorder i just bought another 50 memorex discs disc spindles and when they run out i will still go for memorex chuck a
of all the dvd disks i 've used this summer memorex came second to sony but at half the price i use memorex now because the quality of the recording is very good and the disks are very reliable
nothing special about it except that it just works in my nec laptop burner and in my philips dvd i am satisfied
the item does what it should do as advertized the media code is somewhat few medias use nowadays and it works fine with all my burners i used it on tss and nec no coasters so far i only burned 5
no problem burning with nec drive so far can not properly on old dvd players
i love this now my dvd 's are in order and they fit perfectly
i bought one of these a year ago and have really liked the fact that the spaces will hold up to 5 dvd cases so i can store sets as well as individual disks also i do n't use this as a carrying case so i have had no problem with anything coming apart in fact i like it so well i have just ordered another one
the product is a good value it performed well and was fairly easy to use i only wish it would allow importing play lists from itunes all text had to be manually input overall i 'm very satisfied with the product
i recently purchased this labelmaker system for use on my imac and have had no problems at all i printed out my cd labels on an epson the quality of the printouts is n't as clear as i 'd like most likely due to the quality of the paper but it 's not bad for a home system that cost under 20 it 's easy quick and has lots of cool graphics
i am using the cf card in a mictrotek digital recorder works just great
i purchased this flash card to take on vacation so that i would have enough room for all of the pictures i planned to take i had no problems at all with the card with the images it produced or any transfers i used the card in a nikon 8800 and now use it as my primary memory i recommend this card to anyone for its high quality and low price it is a good value
i bought this card from dell i worried once because some complain it do n't work then i learned the card supports only then i did a test on my pda hp format the existing card to found the pda supports and bought i found the card works perfectly with my pdas hp and dell axim no problem so far must read before buying this card you need to do a file system compatibility test you need to save the card 's content onto host then format the card to format then put the card into the device if the device can use the card right away without formatting you 'll be fil
i previously owned the lexar cf card and thought that was the fastest a cf could get i was completely wrong this card is one fast sucker and it can hold an enormous amount of images in jpeg mode i am able to store over 1000 images in raw mode which i 'm converting to thanks to this large capacity card i am able to hold 444 images all on my ! ! ! if your thinking of buying this card do n't hesitate it is one awsome piece of equipment and one heck of an investment ! !
i ordered this for my daughter for her digital and it was a great price for the size of memory card i have always been very satisfied with purchases from a very good online company with good products and great prices
i am satisfied with this product much better than my 128 card lots of pics i use for ebay big time saver excellent no worries here

just place the ipod dock in a convenient spot plug in the ipod power adapter and connect it to the dock with the supplied ipod dock connector to firewire cable plug the monster cable into the line out connection on the back of the dock and then into any available audio input on a home stereo receiver dock your ipod and rock the house ! this kit includes everything you need to connect ipod with click wheel or ipod mini to a home stereo system includes ipod dock ipod power adapter ipod dock connector to firewire cable monster cable to rca cable bring your music library into your living room this kit includes everything you need to connect your ipod to your home stereo including a monster cable audio cable supports ipod models with dock connector does not support ipod shuffle
this stereo connector is fabulous i already had a very good kenwood stereo system with great speakers now i can play any of the songs from my ipod through my stereo the wires from this kit just plug into the back of the receiver in an open slot i use the video 2 '' slot on my receiver the connecting wire goes into the ipod cradle then simply put the ipod in the cradle select video 2 on the receiver and all of my music at my fingertips without getting out hundreds of cds also because the ipod will shuffle now my stereo shuffles too either through all of my music or through any genre finally not only does it play the songs but it also charges the ipod as well this is absolutely the best accessory i 've purchased for my ipod it 's well worth the investment
ok here 's what you get 1 power supply brick 1 ipod dock 1 cable to connect power supply brick and dock 1 cable to connect dock and stereo this version of the kit is compatible with and generation ipods those with a dock connector on the bottom and with the ipod mini although the dock connector is electronically the same for all these ipods the dimensions of the ipod itself differ by model thus the dock comes with different plastic tops for the different sizes of ipods and you snap on the top for your ipod check the size carefully before snapping on the cover it goes on easily but it does n't come off easily the cable that connects the power supply brick and the dock is a special apple cable but the cable that connects the ipod and the stereo system is nothing special just a standard stereo minijack plug on one end and two rca phono plugs on the other you can get a compatible cable from many different vendors and in many different lengths which in my case was a good thing because the length in the kit was too short is the kit a good buy well it depends if you price all of the components in the kit separately you will find that the kit is cheaper than the individual parts even if you have to replace the stereo cable as i did but the question is do you need to buy all the parts let 's assume for the moment that you do in fact want to attach your ipod to your stereo and consider what you might be able to do without 1 power supply brick your ipod and dock will in fact work fine without being plugged into the power supply the is that without it you will drain the battery of the ipod while it is plugged into your stereo you can get a dock and a stereo cable for substantially less than this kit so if you 're ok with the battery issue you can save money by not getting the kit 2 ipod dock you can plug the ipod into the stereo without the dock the same stereo cable that connects the dock to the stero will also connect the ipod to the stereo there are two disadvantages to this first the dock gives a true meaning that the volume control on the ipod does n't affect the volume coming out of the dock so you just use the stereo 's volume control to control the playback volume the jack on the ipod however is affected by the ipod 's volume control so if you connect it to the stereo you have to be careful about the fact that there are two volume controls in the system which is annoying at best and there might be some risk to your stereo if the ipod 's volume is too high it is also worth noting if you have a power supply brick you do not need the dock to recharge your ipod the brick can plug into the ipod directly if you are ok with the thing and whether and how to keep your ipod upright without it you can save money by not getting the kit and doing without the dock 3 brick to dock cable if you do n't have the brick you do n't need the cable if you do have the brick you need the cable or the brick is n't going to do you any good if you have decided you can do without recharging the ipod while it is connected to your stereo you can skip the brick and this cable both 4 cable this is the thing you ca n't do without if you want to connect your ipod and your stereo but you have a lot of choices on vendors if this is all you 're getting even if you are n't getting a dock the cable that would connect the dock to the stereo is the same one that would connect the ipod to the stereo directly one more thing to consider is that your ipod might have already come with one or more of these pieces and if you are n't using them elsewhere you could use them as part of your stereo and just buy any other pieces you need and not get the whole kit for me i did n't have any extra pieces and i wanted the works to recharge the ipod and not have to worry about a double volume control so i got the kit i also got the navipod ir remote which you can get right here at amazon so that i could control it remotely like the rest of my stereo gear to make your decision just figure out what you want to have what pieces you have already and what you might be willing to live without and then make your decision hope this was helpful
a lot of space my computer is over old so i use these cd 's as a great back up for storing all my old documents my ebooks and my pics
100 cds is a lot of cds though you 'd be surprised how many it takes to back up a pc uh when did you last back up your data you can put pictures files music on these cds we use them just for data backup and use fellowes software and labels to make custom labels with contents these are filed in an album and it 's easy to reload or retrieve data in this manner we have not had any problem writing or reading these cds
i do all my burning on a standard windows media player and it 's almost entirely data and music no video for my purposes these cd 's sound great in some cases it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat that may be a trick my ears are playing on me but nevertheless i 'm a big fan of the memorex and they 're a steal if you catch the sale price recommended
this product has not had any flaws from day 1 ! quality is great
these cds are always a great price and a good buy no complaints
as a person who has used lots of writable cd and dvd products i would highly recommend this product i have yet to have any problems of any kind while using this product if your storage needs are under 650 megabytes i would buy this product note this product needs several megabytes of room for formatting and does not hold exactly 700 merabytes of your data for the price listed this ad it is a great deal as
these and fuji are the best cdrs on the market very few bad disks in the batch the price seals the deal !
very good item for the amount of money it cost i would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a decent amount of space
the best value in memory stick is sandisk quality and very good price i will buy again sandisk products
first time to get into the digital age '' when investigating about what to purchase i was advised to be sure to memory stick that was fast '' this is blazing ! burst shots movies etc
this product has worked very well in my sony digital camera nothing has gone wrong after having it used for 3 months now good alternate to sony 's produo memory stick which works with the psp as well
when i buy flash memory i consider price speed manufacturer and vendor i got this particular memory stick for a sonyericsson phone i paid extra to get it from amazon no they do n't always have the best price this way i am confident that i can return it if i got the wrong one or have a problem with it the card works fine in my phone and since i have a usb cable that hooks up to the phone i do n't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader i have not yet experienced any problems with sandisk memory products i am told that the sandisk sticks are faster than sony 's but i have no way to confirm this nor do i know if my phone player camera is able to take advantage of faster speeds the longest process is transferring music to the phone and i was n't in a hurry anyway this stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format so i can use the stick that i replaced in my sony camcorder which had a stick in it no it 's not a typo it 's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick
i recommend this item to all them who intend to buy 1 gb memory stick for their cameras and cells
i have a sony cybershot i love the camera and use it for taking scuba diving pictures i bought this memorystick duo to use for that purpose i can take up to 45 minutes of video or close to 400 pictures on highest quality setting the memorystick comes with an adapter so you can use it in full size memory stick applications as i do in the camera or you can use this without the adapter for psp and pda or cell phones ! the price could n't be beat anywhere else and i received the shipment within a week at my fpo mailbox on base here in japan if you want a great deal pick one up i may even buy one more for when i travel so i do n't have to take my laptop with me to download and reformat the card at this price i can afford it
i could easily found amazon is the cheap seller of this product others will the same item for less online but they charge big amount of shipping and tax the product is real good and working nice with my new sony camcorder
earbuds are of good qualitywinding case is of no use i took it as a replacement for ipod earbuds the quality is much better than the one suppplied by apple along with ipod
these earphones are the best i ever had i never had to try other pairs of earphone because i absolutely loved these that i keep buying it ! after 6 years i buy the same one everytime of course i never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that i brought but ca n't seem to throw them out because it costed money it seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and i can answer why thats happening it 's actually static electricity i experienced it myself a couple of times because i was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form it 's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones i suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked the bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones hey for 10 bucks or less you ca n't except sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model i abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year i think these are the best rather than buying something thats 100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost broken or stolen
this item is the greatest bass is excellent suround i never got like this purity of sound from other headsets or earphones although i have another sony headset sports headset its good but its nothing like this and this one is only for 10 or less ! ! !
i bought these to use with my samsung player while the packaged earbuds were good the sound was just drowning in bass i like good bass but not when it completely overpowers everything else i had given the sony 51 's a try and promptly returned them they sounded ok but kind of made my ears hurt and for 40 they were n't worth it i had read some reviews on these 828 's so i decided to go with these the sound is incredible the bass is well defined but is balanced nicely with the midrange and treble i was literally hearing nuances in the music that i did n't with other buds they fit very well though any earbuds will start to feel uncomfortable after a period of extended use which is discouraged anyway a set of black foam earbud pads is included i always prefer to use the pads but it is of course your own call whether or not you use them the pads will wear out but you can buy exact replacements at radio shack pack of 4 for 4 that fit perfectly personally i usually end up replacing the pads every few months or so my only gripe about the 828 's and the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the cord is too short for my taste about another foot or so would be nice otherwise this is a great product and at around 10 is a steal
these earphones are incredible ! they are comprised of excellent bass and treble you experience everything much nicely these earphones compared to the ipod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things i bought these from ebay for 8 and for that amount of price you ca n't regret buying these sensational earphones
i 've been on the lookout for replacement earbuds for my nano and finally found these i think they are just awesome and believe apple should bundle these with their nano for the price this is a steal with the right eq setting on the nano i just love these buds excellent bass and with the 'treble booster ' eq setting in the ipod on these buds become perfect nearly before getting these buds i bought senn grado and koss and though all of these are really good for different kinds of music that i listen none of them compliment my ipod nano the way these buds too with the winding case their style their sound quality and an unbelivable price i think they are just the perfect buds for the nano as for their comfort i think they are well suited for people on the move and are as comfortable as the original apple buds go get these and soon you 'll be getting another pair
i had a pair of earbuds that came with my creative player last september that i really liked but for whatever reason the cord length was different between the left and right earbud either way i tore them up on accident and decided to go with these sonys the bass is n't quite as strong as it was in the creative ones but these are solid earbuds and worth the price the cord length is the same for both earbuds on this model and the nice little plastic winding case is handy for the price these are definitely worthy of a purchase
just my two cents i bought these from the sony store for 15 bucks two years ago they 've lasted me this long for light office use so at this seems to be a good budget earphones i 'm not an audiophile so i do n't need expensive earphones however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack the wires got loose and the sound just stopped moral of the story do n't twist or touch the pros lightweight comfortable fit for my ears cons eventually broke cheap earphone covers will get lost easil
i have had an ipod mini for over a year now and everyone knows ipods come with the classic white apple earbuds well one day i missplaced my apple earbuds and borrowed my dad 's earbuds the sony ones on this page i needed to borrow them 'cause i was getting dragged to my little sister 's softball tournament which was pretty far away the catch here my dad drives a huge diesel truck the noisy ones so we all got into the truck and i tried out the headphones and i was just blown away i could actually hear my music unlike the apple ones these were quiet and comfortable actually shaped like an ear they even come with a cool case and little plushy things the only bad thing about the little black plush things is they slip off the earbuds very easily and will eventually disspear it 's a pity too they were very comfy but even without the plushies the earbuds were still comfy basically i highly recommend these lovely lovely little earbuds
i received a previous version of this mouse as a promotional gift from microsoft and since have not been able to separate myself from it whenever i travel it is the most plug and play '' piece of hardware i have ever purchased for a pc noteboook or otherwise no software installation or complicated setup necessary it of course does not have the bells and whistles that the logitech revolution series mice have ie tilt to side scrolling customizable buttons and buttons for fast and efficient web browsing but for basic functionality this mouse simply can not be beaten as a travel companion it is extraordinarily lightweight and low maintenance with its receiver there are no worries of ever leaving for a business trip with unnecessary weight or having to account for multiple just to make offsite work more tolerable ie why bring a mouse when just using the laptop 's touchpad was a better option than having to worry about one more thing to keep track of this mouse however has me spoiled i even use it while working on my laptop at home sitting on my couch the optical laser even works quite well on the surface of a leather couch ! the buttons and scroll wheel are also amazingly easy on the hand when doing a ton of repetitive movements one thing of importance to note however is that the version i got from amazon does have the same adjustable receiver that my promotional version has while the receiver still easily and conveniently snaps into the bottom of the mouse it sticks out quite a bit more than the adjustable version does and resultingly would also not work as well with notebooks that have a vertical as opposed to horizontal usb port nevertheless this is such a great mouse i felt compelled to have more than just one
i bought this mouse about 14 months back ! ! ! and it 's been working great ! pros 1. nice design 2. good looks 3. ergonomic 4. i use it almost 14 hours a day and need to the battery like once in a month 5. good range i did not need to buy a rc because of this 6. light 7. can rotate the usb transmitter by 90 deg hence will work even if you have vertical usb slots on your laptop cons 1. would have liked it more if it had an internal battery and some way of charging it through the usb connection i use a rechargeable battery and need to charge it monthly
i bought 2 of this and its works very well in my home and in my office
muy pero muy bueno es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira
this is a great mouse the size is perfect because it is n't too big or too small also the battery lasts forever i 've had the mouse for over a year i use it every day and i still have n't replaced the battery i liked it so much that i got one for my mom when she got a laptop she 's a flight attendant so she travels all the time and she really likes the mouse too good portability and functionability
product works great fits nicely in my hand but i do have small hands battery life not that long though otherwise worth the money
have not had to use it yet so i do n't know did i really need it i do n't know but i bought it
after having two sandisk card readers and one lacie card reader die on me i invested in this lexar card reader for the money it has worked flawlessy with pro compact flash cards up to in size i am very impressed with the transfer speeds and the unit is not too big for traveling the door that covers the slot however is very flimsy and easily deattaches but fortunately easily reattaches too i use mac os x and it works just fine i also used it with windows xp without any installation or transfer issues
i 'm a mac user os 10.4 so i particularly like that this reader does n't require a separate driver cards mount on my desktop as any drive would and the software that came with my canon powershot senses the card automatically i have had no trouble with the cover hinge as another reviewer mentioned i love the fact that it 's small and lightweight and fits into a tiny pocket on my camera case so i never lose track of it the led lets you know when files are being transferred and when it 's safe to disconnect the device overall it 's inexpensive fast and a great value
outstanding little product good human interface able to use it immediately and much faster than cameral software
this little reader is fast and as easy to use as a usb flash drive pop in your card plug it in and wahlah all your files are shown transfers are very fast and easy it uses a standard usb cable so it 's likely you could use the same cable for a variety of devices player camera cell phone the device is somewhat flimsy however and the front always snaps off when you try to open the unit rather than working like a hinge as it should this is somewhat annoying to have to reattach the hinge everytime so it gets 4 stars still a very good buy especially for the price
a simple cheap investment this cf reader actually does what it should transfer info from compact flash to the computer previous kodak 1.0 reader had issues after a few weeks and stopped working after 2 months this one is much faster and is still working ahhhhh
this reader is very fast compared to my and pcmcia compact flash readers this one is about or more as fast it is small and compact the only thing i do n't like is the required usb cable though it is included instead of a built in usb plug just one more thing to bring with my laptop
just some specs missing from amazon 's description usb 2.0 compactflash reader small and travels with ease led status indicator indicates when files are being transferred data transfer speeds up to backward compatible with usb 1.1 ships with removable usb 2.0 cable features designed for large data transfers like images music and video data transfer 5 to 6 times faster than using usb 1.1 portable weighs only 1.5 ounces protective cover case keeps reader pins away from external hazards compatible with windows and mac os x and 9.1 no drivers required with most current operating systems limited warranty
i was so impressed with the amount of memory on this media card i wondered if i could take a movie of my son 's 3 minute song at his school band concert i probably had at least a dozen or more pictures at the highest quality on the card already so was so surprised that i had 23 minutes of movie memory available ! what a price to pay for peace of mind
i have had this memory card for a little less than two months and i have had no problems using it with my fugi camera i would recommend this card to a friend
the holds soooo many pictures and videos ! this is so compact and my pictures are downloaded quickly ! buy it you 'll love it
this was the least expensive 1 gb memory card i have ever seen and it works as well as it should
product was just what i was looking for and at the right price could not have been happier with my purchase i will look for this vendor again in the future
this card seems to give the same excellent photos as my other fuji cards love the huge number of photos i can take very handy when traveling outside the us with no access to back up
i found the service fast and the product great it was a very good price thanks i will use your service again
this card is the largest size that will allow clean video with finepix cameras from 2004 or earlier the lag time is minimal with this card and video is excellent from fuji website note for owners of finepix cameras made before 2004 check notice below for the operating compatibility of older finepix cameras with type m and h
great card crisp clear shots fuji continues to provide the best in pic cards
i love this printer simple to use and great for the price cartridge does n't last more than 2 months if you do a lot of printing but inexpensive to replace and easy to find
i 've had this printer for about 3 months i do a good amount of printing and still have nearly half the catridges left i 've only printed papers and images that came out never tried photos yet but i would n't be surprised if they come out decent ! not to mention there are only 2 catridges compared to 4 on my old epson ! that are a decent price compared to other brands it rarely jams but you should keep an eye on nothing too extreme it 's small lightweight and prints from the last page to the first so it 's all in order once it 's finished printing i bought this new on amazon for around 30 dollars and would say it was the best purchase i could have made better than my old epson i spent 200 on that guzzled ink after two photos and died after a year !
this is a very nice printer especially for the price quick printing good quality
printer exactly as advertised small and easy to use was delivered quickly along with the black ink cartridge it is perfect for my use
i only paid 30 including shipping and taxes the ink cartridges alone are worth that printer works great set up easy but do not use the cd provided it loads and incredible amount that you do not of which is impossible to get off your computer once loaded instead google a driver off the internet and download it
there are so many times we often see the musts of having a quality printer for all occasions although it is n't actually a bad thing it does become a important tool for our everyday computer use that has been the case whether you need to fax a freshly printed version of a resume or show a graphic chart of sales for your company well the folks at know exactly what they 're talking about they 've been making quality printers for all walks of life but with the hassle of finding a inexpensive printer for those on a strict budget than this is your key to a quality printer at a inexpensive cost the deskjet 3930 color inkjet printer is arguably the most convient and easy to setup printer right now on the market it just simply hooks through your usb port either or 2.0 and it will print anything you need to save on paper it is easy to operate and runs smoothly without any messy problems the copies it prints up are neat and near flawless on a color or a black inkjet cartridge 21 and 22. still there are a few disadvantages though with the printer one of them is that it does n't come with a standard usb cable you 'd have to buy that on your own and the same goes with the black inkjet cartridge although that is a must you can still print black and white copies for your convience with the colored inkjet cartridge 22 by itself despite a couple of you 'd need to buy the hp deskjet 3930 is a printer for anyone who needs a good printer without a inexpensive price i needed this to replace a problem i had with my previous printer and it works like a charm i definitely recommend this printer a whole lot price convience easy to operate b instructions b overall b
i was looking for a cheap dependable printer and found exactly what i needed just to print out invoices that 's all we do with the printer ca n't beat this printer for the price and quality of print we also received it when in a timely manner in good condition i love ordering on amazon ! !
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
the advancements in technology never cease to amaze me they continue to get smaller and smaller even when you did n't think it was possible such is the case for the panasonic sd memory card as well not only is it small but it has a large capacity for adapting to a variety of digital content types this sd memory card can write data at a rate of 10 mb per second ! i mainly use my sd memory card to save music from my player i normally get about 5 hours out of the card i highly recommend this to anyone who uses audio video communications and information devices and appliances it is the wave of the future
when i bought my ipod this part was included fortunately when i sold the ipod i forgot to include it because we are getting a video today and now i learn this item is not included way to go apple i believe it is called fleecing your customers at least there is an alternative way to charge these very useful item i agree as much as i hate paying more i also hate burning out a high dollar piece of electronics because some company had monkeys putting them together in a remote jungle in indonesia or something i have had too many friends lose cells in particular because of the 5 charger they found online or at the flea market
functionally this works fine compact design ac plug folds in for a smooth case easy to pack hard to damage and since there is no cord associated with the input to the ac outlet there is one less thing to lose or damage there is a usb cord from the unit to the ipod but that is it a little more expensive since it has an apple logo associated with it but it works
yes apple should include this thing with the higher end ipods at least but they do n't the point of this post is to remind prospective buyers this with electronics you tend to get what you pay for so you 're tempted by those usb adapters stay away from them you have probably a couple hundred bucks tied up in your ipod s it does n't make sense to now and take a risk with shoddy electronics for your ipod same ipod that you scrupulously protect from scratches and such apple designed their usb power adapter to work with their ipods and they do work very well shame on apple for fleecing us though but shame on you if you damage the electronics of your ipod by using some flea market power adapter just buy apple's
this should be included in the box when you buy the ipod shame on you apple
when you use the video function on your ipod it depletes the battery pretty quick i can keep this nifty little gadget with me and juice up my ipod anytime i want great product i highly recommend it
not much to say about the item other than it works as expected without any issues whatsoever
not a coaster in the bunch i started using these a year back and have stuck with a winner i wo n't buy anything else and a bargain at that too
i have had no problem using these disks i have bought several packs and all disks seem to work and have been great in transferring home movies doing computer backups etc
i have used over 100 of the dics to burn movies and otehr files and have never had a problem with the quiait they work great
i 've burned about 200 memorex dvds and havent had a single works for me
the memorex discs are great i have a lacie external burner that i use with my mac and i have not yet burned a bad disc i would reccommend this product to anyone looking for lots of media for a good price
manufactured of a soft gray felt like material a tough leather bottom and draw string closure at the top this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements i store my lenses in a camera bag and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space this case is meant for use with the canon usm usm lenses these l lenses normally come with the case when sold new there is no need to buy one as amazon often suggests however if your case is worn replacing it to protect your lens is recommended pros protects your glass investment cons i can not think of an
i bought this flash drive about 4 months ago and it 's worked perfectly i use it everyday it has a great feature for hidding important information a password restricted area on the flash drive it 's perfect because you do n't have to worry anymore when lending your flash drive about compromising your info
this flashdrive does its job well under normal circumstances it works fine for transfering data between computers running windows when network is not avail or when large filesize is involved its impressively quick at uploading big files and best of all you can take it right out of the package and use it no fuss or setup time involved windows xp recognizes it in seconds
i 'm a school teacher and use the cruzer to store all of my lesson plans and school related documents the 2.0 gb replaced my 1.0 gb that went through the wash twice and still worked but was starting to come apart they take abuse and keep going the amount of memory is great its very simple to use all you need to do is plug it into the usb port and its ready to use just like an old floppy disk i have 3 years worth of documents on it and i have n't even made a dent in the amount of memory i would highly recommend this product its a great buy for the price
i have had 2 different brands of flash drives one was a lexar that i went through 2 in about a 4 month span i have 2 of the sandisk cruzer mini drives and i had no problems what so ever with speed and durablity in fact both of the drives accidently went through the laundry and they both still work greatest drive i ever got highly recommended !
i 've had this drive over a year and have used it continuously to store notes and documents both at school and at work this device is slender enough to fit in a laptop usb slot and allow the slot beneath it to be available for another device mouse thumb drive etc also i 've accidentally sent this baby through the washer a couple of times i do n't think it 's been in the dryer yet but the fact that it 's been in water twice and still works makes me glad that i purchased the device i did by the way i use my drive to transfer files from every computer i work on which includes my mac mini my dell at work my macbook pro at school and my linux box serving my web site no drivers were needed for osx xp or suse linux one last positive statement the lanyard that comes with the drive works great it 's soft and has a great little clip that has worked hundreds of times for me this is a very appropriate drive to wear as a necklace if you need to move a lot of geek tools or data around daily one negative for thumb drives in general they stick out of your laptop and if you tilt your laptop towards them they may bend or crack external devices should have joints to mitigate this problem
when i was shopping for a flash drive i saw that someone complained about the slow speed of this drive it almost scared me away from buying it but now i 'm glad i do n't believe everything i hear this is the fastest media i 've ever used and if someone has one that does n't run fast the problem is with their own system or files a hundred megs in the blink of an eye is plenty fast enough for me i 'm a hands down believer in the sandisk cruzer mini usb 2.0 flash drive stop looking cause you just found the best buy
i use my cruzer mini constantly at work it 's great for quick data transfers small utilities drivers or patching systems that are off the network it 's slim and lightweight enough that i tend to drop it in my shirt pocket and forget about it you probably see where this is going but yes it 's been run through the washing machine at least four times what may be even more impressive is that it 's been run through the dryer three times once i did catch it after being washed and saved it from the dryer allowing it to air dry instead it still works as well as the day i took it out of the package never missing a beat
like any good piece of technology this card stays out of the way operating fast i have a canon digital rebel xt so far and behind the scenes i bought this model because it was the best price per storage space solution for the format at the time i 'm sure that very soon that magical price point will shift to 4 gb or higher
bought this cf card for my new olympus back in may so far this card is great really fast transfer rate from the card to the computer about a month ago 3 of the photos i took corrupted i just reformated the card with the camera so far so good
i use this with my canon rebel xt and it works fantastic with mp camera you need to have fast media or you might miss a moment i have had many sandisk cards and they have all worked flawlessly this one stays in my camera all the time and i am to fill it up on a single shoot this is the equivalent of dozens of rolls of film i dont shoot in raw but even if i did it would be fine
with the large file size of pro dslr 's shot in raw every little bit of speed counts whether at capture or download there are faster compact flash cards out there and there are definately slower ones but for the price this is a great card
i use this card with my nikon the card writes data incredibly quickly saving my raw 10.2 mp images with no problem i 've used this card in all sorts of conditions from below freezing to well over 100 degrees with no problems the data recovery software included is equally amazing i was able to salvage pictures on my card i accidentally erased quite long ago with no loss this comes with a warning pictures you deleted '' remain on the camera so it needs to be wiped securely before exchanging hands finally this card while fast is only as fast as the camera if you do n't need this speed there are slower cheaper ones available
i purchased several of these cards they work great and as advertised the has a memory buffer but these are still fast cards ! i have used them in the as well
i usually purchase lexar cards for my the sandisk was a better price so i decided to try it it is fast with its write speed i can pop off a number of images without having to wait for it to write to the card the image quality is excellent i think that the colors may be a little more vibrant than the ones i have on the lexar cards i think that i am going to switch to sandisk
i purchased this card to go with my canon dslr initially was worried about the speed of transfer from camera to this card then from card to desktop my concerns were unfounded
after having great experience with the extreme iii card i ordered the just before i went on a short vacation i love the speed of the extreme iii cards writing to the card i can actually exceed the camera 's stated continuous frame manual says about 9 but i 've gotten over 20 in a row with before a delay and reading the large amount of data off the card is similarly speedy when using a good usb 2.0 card reader sandisk just released the extreme iv cards but for the price difference i think this card is a better deal
i am hard on cards and these take it well they keep up with my and have the space promised i like the soft keychain protector case they come i
sandisk leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one it works excellent on my phone samsung would have bought a but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it so bear that in mind for pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent for music as an lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video data and in general is terrific just like i said sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card i will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions only sandisk is extremely reliable personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly
it comes in the retail packaging and a little clear plastic case which holds both the card and the regular sd adapter i got it for my lg phone and so far no problems at all
it does what its supposed to do but its kind of slow i bought it for my lg fusion phone i am not sure if it is the phone or the card but when it is pulling images from the card it is extremely slow have no problem playing through
did n't realize exactly how small this chip would be has worked well with no problems so far have had it about 2 months would recommend to others
it seems that the micro age really is here these microsd chips are big on storage i bought this chip for my lg chocolate phone of all things its a cheap way to store pictures notes music 's etc great price
the transaction was easy and the response was immediate i received the product well within the time it was expected and i have been happy with the memory card since i received it
bought the card from emartbuy since they were the cheapest i got the card after like 4 days later their great yea the card seems to be good sandisk does n't make garbage unlike other brands good card get i
i bought this card to replace the card that came with my garmin gps works great ! i was able to use the included sd adapter for my card
i use the memory card in my samsung phone works perfecty
for the price i doubt you could do better true there are devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance but if all you 're after is a significant improvement in the quality of every channel and dvd you watch you ca n't beat the ads for it 's price the biggest flaw is the device 's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my philips plasma set to for moments this aside i 'm very happy with the ads especially it 's under 300 price one day maybe i 'll upgrade to a unit by dvdo but not until they come don to the 500 range
this is about the least expensive scaler you will find period i have a home theater system which includes a front projection system with a jvc vcr and a high end dvd player the projectors native resolution is i set the hd vcr for and use the hdtv to downconvert the to my projectors maximum resolution the picture looks great i also use the scaler to upscale dvd and it does a good job when you enlarge a dvd image without the use of the upconverter on a 100 '' screen it doesnt stand up too well and normal televison fairs even worse this scaler upconverts both and i cant begin to tell what an improvement this scaler makes on quality one improvement they should make is to include an rgb connection my projector does not have a component connection so i use a kds transcoder while there are scalers that do a better job they dont come close to the bang for buck you get out of this unit
i still have to review some of the finer functions of the unit but overall it does its job one major bonus that most overlook it eliminates a ton of wires going to the that is a huge saving right offthe bat the native of looks good a looks great upconverted too i found the remote to be a bit clunky when changing inputs and using pip it might be just a case of getting used to it i am looking for a way of hiding select inputs overall this product simplifies installation of multiple devices and looks good too
i have had this kodak charger for almost 2 years now i liked it so well i went back and order another one for my daughter i use mine to charge aa batteries for my olympus and s series canon digital cameras my daughter recharges her olympus camera and for battery operated toys for her twins between the two of us we have 3 years experience using this model charger we like it because it is so portable just fold in the ac prongs and toss it in your bag purse or coat pocket no need to carry the charger plus an ac adapter and cord with you this charger easily fits in our camera bags i have used the kodak rapid charger to charge various batteries rated in power from 1600 to 2200 milliamps ma with no problem it usually takes about 3 hours what sold me was the portability and the trickle charge with some battery chargers you have to be sure to unplug it after so many hours before it overheats and becomes a fire hazard the kodak rapid charger can be plugged in and it will not overheat or overcharge the batteries so if i forget the batteries are charging it is no problem i can unplug this charger whenever '' i especially appreciate that when i travel and can recharge the batteries in an afternoon or overnight in my hotel room when i travel is when i am most distracted and not following my normal routine so that is when i am most apt to forget that i have batteries charging not a problem with this charger you can leave the charger plugged in indefinitely this charger lights up with green lights when it is charging when the batteries are charged the lights go out so it is easy to see when the batteries are fully charged even from across the room some folks have mentioned that the batteries fall out i believe that is because when you plug this charger into a wall outlet the batteries are in a vertical position in the charger gravity will tend to pull them out of the charger if the batteries are not firmly seated in the charger or you slap the charger against the wall so hard the batteries will bounce out of the charger i have had this happen too however all i had to do is put the batteries the charger and gently insert the charger into the wall outlet when i am in a hurry is when i have had the batteries fall out besides i figured if i can not gently insert this charger in the wall i can always use a short extension cord so i can lay the charger in a horizontal position however that would mean i have to carry a cord around and i think that would defeat the portability of this charger though i have found it is easier for me to slow down and put the charger gently into the wall so the batteries do n't fall out i highly recommend this battery charger
this cf card is perfect for anybody who needs a high capacity for pics but does n't care about the transfer speed it may be a bit annoying though especially if you try to download all the from the card to your hard drive because it takes some time i do still consider it a real good purchase
i am new to digital photography till now i have mainly used point shoot film cameras i purchased this card for my canon slr and i am completely satisfied it stores more than 500 photos at highest quality and i found no delay whatsoever in storing images the card perfomed very well in continuos shots ! people who are complaining about speed must note that this is one of the cheapest branded cards available in the market and should not be compared with higher speed costlier cards
i had bought a lexar professional 512 when the digital rebal first came out at a whopping 230 it has a write speed of i needed to buy a bigger card becuase when i took pictures at events i did not have enough memory and had to keep changing my jpeg quality the kingston was a great choice not only did it have four times the memory but a great price to go with it i would recommend this product to most photographers the only down side i have had is the write speed claims to be and my lexar at seems to be faster if you are a action photographer this is not the card for you this is why i did not give it a five star rating i went on vacation this month and had plenty of room to spare on the card it did everything i needed it to do
i have been using this on my canon rebel xt for about 9 months i also have a similar cf card made by sandisk ultra ii which i paid much more i 'm fully satisfied with this and do n't see any difference in performance between the two btw i shoot in raw format and the 8 megapixel raw files are pretty big
i love the memory size of the card but however when you want to shoot withing a very shot time frame the card is slow an excellent example would be a birthday party you take a snap and want to take the next one you may have to wait at times and you may end up losing the shot initially i thought it was okay but when it kept repeating i felt a bit disappointed i have the sandisk ultra ii 1 gb and it has never had a delay i would used this card for situations where i have plenty of time between shots maybe a still life
this memory card handles the job really well unless maybe you 're a professional sports photographer it 's plenty fast enough no problems using it with my canon rebel xt it holds about 550 pictures jpegs at the highest resolution 8.2 mp
the card works well in my camera and was purchased at a good price compared to several other sources no problems with delivery
lots of i do n't have to worry about running out of even in raw format and a ton of pcitures in jpeg format plus it was very affordable i have no complaints i shoot with a canon digital rebel i 'm very happy with this purchase
cost is low because the company no longer exists no tech support no company website just be prepared for win 2000 and xp you must download your own drivers http has at least the xp driver it takes some monkeying to get used to have to press a little harder than you first expect to get it to do anything draws like a charm best value for mone
i bought this recently not knowing much about what was out on the market in terms of tablets and i have some advice if you 're going to buy this product pros it 's a shame wacom does n't make tablets that are since i have found out that this is the perfect it 's not so small that you have no room to draw properly and it 's not big enough that you have to hurt your arm with long movements after a tiring day at work the i bought this for 20 c dollars at the local radioshack but you can get one for much cheaper online compared to a wacom graphire which is and upwards of around 50 us dollars it 's compatible with almost every graphics software and works remarkably well unless you 're a professional graphics designer you wo n't need any of the costly wacom tablets if you 've got this cons when i first unpackaged it i was tearing my hair out for two days trying to figure out how to make this work in windows xp for all of you out there with a similar problem download this driver for the newer versions of windows and relax http the pen sensitivity will need to be set to your desired first so do n't try it out before going to control panel and changing the settings i find that the best setting to use for the barrel button option is left SMILE hope that helped a bit
i 'm a computer artist and use the jam studio a bunch yes there are driver issues if you tinker with it some you 're fine the software bundle is useless but it works with any application i 've tried most tablets a lot of them make me feel like i 'm etching glass the jam studio has a more natural not to mention perfect size ! drawing surface than the rest i even like the corded pen i do n't have to go far when it gets dropped more pressure levels would be nice but not a must hey at this price i would buy two it 's a shame the company went under this product got written off rather quickly it 's too bad
i just received my sketch pad mainly for the use of playing isketch but i tried it out in my psp program and it works just fine in there also i did n't even use the that came with it i have winxp and got the drivers for it http and everything works just fine ! SMILE it does take a little bit to get used to using been using a mouse for so long but i love it
this is now my bag it has excellent build quality and it 's pretty much the perfect size i really like the style and the way it fits staying very close to my body and it it easy to pull around to the front i have mine holding my digital rebel with my 1.8 efs and kit lens that pretty much fills up the main comparment the front pocket is big enough for all of my accessories except flash i have only 2 minor gripes 1 the color is a little different than in the online images 2 the shoulder strap starts off nice and wide but becomes very thin by the time it reaches my shoulder carrying it fully loaded can start to bother my shoulder after a few hours i think i 'm going to have to try to add some padding or widen the strap myself somehow this should n't be a problemif you have lighter gear it 's probably the best value bag i have seen
this camera bag is better than my 140 tamrac bag it holds my camera with a 70 lens attached my lens fits nicely next to it and the pockets provide plenty of room for all the misc stuff the quality of materials and stitching are strap is comfortable and versatile
i have only had this monitor for a couple of day 's but i am verry happy with it it came well packaged and you cant beat the price i shopped around and this was the one for me i dont know about the other review but with in 5 min of opening the box i was using the monitor and it worked verry well ! ! thank 's amazon
i had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up but after a little tweaking it works beautifully previously owned regular crt what an improvement ! superb clarity and brightness for the money you just ca n't go wrong with this one
i first tried these blank dvds and they did not work for me and i was very frustrated there was clear labeling on the package that new firmware was needed for many dvd writers to work with these discs however my dvd writer was a variation of what was listed so i tried about 10 discs and only 1 worked tonight i downloaded the firmware for a variation of my hp drive and all works fine bottom line expect to download the firmware and these will work great
first time user of memorex a friend recommended them works absolutely perfect used over 30 of these dvds with only 4 defectives burns and that was because of an os problem
especially for dvds these have been working perfectly for me i have n't wasted one disk i had similar problems before when i purchased the incorrect media i would try and try to burn a dvd and got an error every time after tons of i realized that i needed this type for the hardware that i have i have n't had one problem since i changed check your prior to purchasing to make sure it is all compatible it will save you a lot of time and trouble
i use the pink circles to buff the and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd as i thought it would well i thought that those marks would disappear after i used the repair paste with the yellow circles but they 're still there is it supposed to be like this the reason i bought the thing was to make the cds look like new but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over could someone answer this question for me please
i 've been looking for a way to fix the dvds our toddler enjoys '' obviously he should n't handle them but he loves helping '' so how can i resist unfortunately he scratched up his favorite dvd to the point it wo n't play most sections so this device arrives and i run the repair buffer then repair repair and clean and to my disappointment the disc was n't playable until i tried using more than a few small drops of the repair paste using three big drops and his dvd is playable once again i 'm repairing and cleaning dvds from the library too if we still had netflix this would be indispensable the instructions are clear and the device works quickly its pretty noisy though
i had a rare dvd disc that had developed a tangle of faint cracks making later tracks unplayable i used the advice given in an earlier review to use two drops of the repair fluid aluminum oxide for the initial cycle and single drops thereafter this was good advice and made some improvements but there was persistent stalling and in some tracks the unit works by having an electric motor spin two cylinders each of which rubs an surface against the cd or dvd the set comes with each repair surface attached to a flat disc with three prongs mounted into a clear plastic base the buffing surface comes only on its to go between repair and buffing one must use an enclosed small plastic to pry open the surface between the and the clear plastic base this is not mentioned in the instructions also not mentioned is that one may buff more than once i ended up buffing four times this was probably more than necessary sometimes one may put on too much of the repair fluid which may find itself spread unevenly or left in small clumps the result is that areas of the dvd that had played all right before now break up because of irregularities or waves in the fluid coating itself my final cycle involved two larger drops followed by using the repair cycle without putting any extra fluid on this may have smoothed the coating without the more severe action a buffing would have given now the disc works all right throughout there is some loss of picture sharpness but it 's acceptable along the way i sent the customer service rep at aleratec two seeking advice the responses were fast courteous and helpful the product does work but needs more complete instructions and suggestions skill rises with practice be patient at first
with boys aged 2 3 and some poor disc storage procedures when i 'm driving it appeared i was in need of one of these units generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs but it occassionally happens and does n't take long for scratches damage and finger prints to hinder performance and when changing children 's cds in the car i do n't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also i read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products and finally decided on this unit because it runs on power is fully contained and automatic and was about 10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit both items had mixed reviews mostly positive but i found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products i 'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all and one that skipped this product repairs a disc to useable '' condition it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible i can still see but not necessarily feel the scratches it 's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance if a disc plays well but shows scratches i just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair i agree that the instructions with the unit could be better i saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity also some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair so i agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items but it is possible i noticed that i could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the pink disc process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair i ran one disc through 3 times in a row then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine my lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great i usually clean the disc manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime then buff then repair it can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable i think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use
i use this card in my dslr and it works as expected i have n't run into any problems
i 've used many brands of cf card and some others are slow and sketchy seem to need reformatting way too often these sandisk ultra cards however are blazingly quick when storing images or transferring data and have never given me any trouble at all with data loss or corruption
i brought this product for my olympus digital camera worked fine with camera sandisk can come with better firmware update i believe it can performe wonderful with camera tranfer speed of data is ok and sandisk can think about improvement by updated firmware my experience with product is far there is crash price difference between and is too high otherwise i will go for in the sameproduct come in sealed retail upgraded my camera firmware to latest in order to use this product trouble free
i have not had any problems with this memory card it is very fast when taking pictures as well as downloading them great bu
the card seems to be very high quality i have n't had any problems so far it holds about 600 pictures in the large format in my 3.2 megapixel camera i would definitely recommend it
so far i havent filled up my disc yet using it the disc that came with it would fill up after 3 minutes of talking so far its great
after purchasing this memory card i realized i should have purchased it with my camera instead of waiting as long as i did before this upgrade my camera had a maximum of 18 pictures now i can take 611. i can also now use the video feature of my camera without fear of filling it up why wait this is the best card i could find for the money if you 're thinking about more memory than this i would n't bother unless you take a huge number of photos or have an extremely high res camera
love the ultra ii card i use a lot of sandisk products without any problems
i researched what was the best 5 disc changer and this has all the needed features continues to get high marks from various consumer groups sometimes i have trouble with the automatic play the next dics but i think that is due to a setting i have incorrect this is the second one i have purchased first one the power switch is bad we think and it was less money to purchase new than fix will probably fix first on the cheap and give to a friend then if second one does same thing we know how to fix it overall a great playe
i received this unit via my home insurance after my rca changer was stolen the unit itself is solidly built and i do n't have any issues with the playback performance or picture quality i think if you get this unit you 'll be pretty happy with it what stinks is the documentation remote and setup the manual is your typical engrish guide that most people have come to expect from inexpensive electronics fortunately if you 've had any experience setting up a dvd player there 's not much different here unless you want progressive scan here 's what you have to do if you want to use progressive scan mode 1. connect both the component cables and an or composite cable to your tv hopefully it has both inputs most hdtvs do 2. put your tv on the or composite input 3. enter the setup menu not to be confused with the options menu ! and choose progressive output 4. now you can unhook the or composite cable and put your tv on component input mode thankfully this is a hassle but it 's still assinine that panasonic could n't have either designed an autodetect or used a physical switch like my old rca had with the rca i just hooked up the component cables flipped the switch and set up the dvd player for aspect ratio and i was done lastly the dreaded error i think i figured out what 's probably causing the majority of them when you eject the tray the currently playing is still on the motor and continues to play a neat feature for swapping the other discs without interrupting your music but the upshot is that the ejected tray has an empty slot in it can you guess what happens if you accidently put another into the seemingly empty slot by mistake to avoid this instead of using the eject function use the swap function this will stop the playback and make sure all the discs are out of the drive and avoid damage overall a great player for the price just be careful with it and bear with the tricky setup
after reading some of the previous reviews i wanted to state that this player definitely plays back multichannel discs if you 're only hearing sound out of 2 speakers then there must be a setting you need to change in the setup menu also i 've burned many 's on various dvd burners not panasonic branded and they 've all played back flawlessly on this panasonic player have n't had any problems with this player and i 've owned it for 18 months now
i love this dvd player a huge step up from my old one which was not a progressive scan i did n't have too difficult of a time getting used to the controller which is always a pain when you get a new system and the features are fun i like the ability to adjust the position of the subtitles i watch movies a lot with them on and it 's just nice to have some more freedom with that overall this dvd player is n't the absolute best '' dvd player out there but if you 're looking for a high quality player for a low budget price this is definitely the perfect item
excellent quality for its intended use the price was unbelieveably low you ca n't beat either
this dvd player is a great player that encompasses a wide variety of disc formats one of the best features is that it can store the exact position of playback for 5 discs so that if you stop watching one movie and move on to another you can go back the next day and pick right up where you left off i have tried playing dvds and with jpg images and all have worked successfully
i 've had this dvd player for over two years now and it has worked perfectly even with the scratched up dvds you get from a rental store i have never put a disc in this player and it not play not only is it a wonderful player but it can be set to region free this was a very much appreciated added bonus for me because i buy a lot of region 2 dvds if you are looking for a cheap very good and region free dvd player this one is the right choice the picture is great the sound is great and its performance is wonderful
i ordered the dvd on and so far i have no problems the quality of the picture is great i like the fack that the dvd unit is little and fits everywhere you almost do n't see it it 's light and easy to install thanks kati
i use it outside on my deck for watching dvds in the summer it is sturdy easy to move around and the quality is excellent i would highly recommend it
this is a nice product i buught it beacause i needed to play dvds from foreign country and my fancy sony '' dvd vcr player ca n't read them but this little thing can it reads all the standards i 'm glad i 've got it
i bought this power supply because the breastpump that i used did not have a car adapter instead of buying a new breastpump this linksys car cigarette power supply saved the day it works wonderfully and has a safety mode that will disconnect the power if you are trying to power something out of reach of what the power supply can do it would work wonderfully for laptops as well as other small electrical items that you need mobility with
it worked all the labels from the side of the power supply just fell off kind of looked cheap but it did the job
i use this with a dell inspiron 8600. it works fine even when the laptop is being used and charging at the same time i have n't observed the heating problems others have it gets only moderately warm
bought one several years ago for camping trips use it in a dodge caravan with a laptop and with gameboys it takes a beating by 2 boys in the family car has always been reliable and worked just fine
i bought these for my elderly father who does n't hear very well lets just say i 'm the favorite son once again
these headphones do not possess the latest technology but just work you do need 'line of sight ' to the transmitter for them to work but that is just about the only con i 've found they are really comfortable to wear even after a few hours but the best thing they have is the battery life with the supplied rechargeable batteries they are supposed to last up to 40 hours on a single charge the longest i 've used them is for 12 hours straight and for another 8 hours the next day before recharging them and did not fail recharging them is a matter of leaving them on the overnight and they will be ready for the next day if you go with regular batteries optional they are supposed to last for over 60 hours before they need to be replaced which is a great option allowing you to use regular batteries after the rechargeable ones finally wear out and get another set i bought them to use with my computer to replace regular headphones and installation was as simple as plugging in the connectors and the transmitter power supply they just worked i 've also hooked them up to my stereo and tv with the same ease and am seriously thinking about purchasing another pair to save me from plugging and unplugging them from different appliances
excellent headphone system the reach is of approximately 3 meters and it is listened very well it is also quite comfortable
great buy ! it is easy to use fun and helps motivate
this is a great product not olny that combines technology and sports also gives new meaning to buy it and hit the road
while the sports kit is very reliable and fun to use i found it still to be more of an player than a training tool better for the more casual run than speed work or keeping track of the details of a long training run this is not to say it 's not a great running tool the website is great and offers a lot of motivation and you do n't need to be wearing nike shoes to use this there are many options on ebay and in sports stores that will attach the pode to your current running shoe but i still like my garmin forerunner
and that is saying something this plus a nano is the ideal road companion
this device is awesome i absolutley highly recommend it especially since i used it on the treadmill and discovered the treadmill all this time has given me inaccurate distances i do n't wear nike sneakers but it was easy enough to make a little pouch for the transmitter and pin it under my laces onto the tongue of the sneaker i love that it tracks my runs for me and graphs them so i can see my progress if you 're considering it buy it you wo n't regret it
this is an amazing product that has pushed me to exercise at another level easy to use tried with old nb shoes and new shoes i did calibration only once tradmill shows a slighty different reading but at the end it has pushed me to record an amazing number of miles that i never thought i could do in a short period of time
the sport kit is an excellent addition to the ipod line unfortunately it only works with shoes which are hard to find and a number of us do n't like how they fit or prefer other shoe types you can still use the with other shoes there are a number of home brewed ways and retail products we like the 5.99 shoe pouch you can find the shoe pouch at it will securely attach the sensor to any type shoe otherwise way to go nike and apple great product
at age 52 overweight with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol i decided to save my life and buy new nano and unit here the unit is a joy to use your runs to the website could n't be easier note i have only connection watching your run data collect on the nice graphical interface is great fun ! as stated by several here shoes are not necessary i put my shoe unit in an unused luggage tag and stuffed between my new balance tongue and laces minor complaint during workout i ca n't within songs that are playing a minor complaint when one considers i am now running 2 miles daily ! try the podrunner '' podcast at itunes to find free and extended workout mixes tailored to your desired bpm
this is a very good sd card and is a great size for its value i am using it with the panasonic digital cam and it works perfect for it plays great and can handle video very well overall great sd card
i got the right decision when i brought it it functionned instantly when i put it in my hp 720 camera it is provided with a lifetime warranty and you recieve a plastic box to put the card in it is also the cheapest 128 mb card in the market beware the transfer speed is 2
sandeep 's review was informative but for photographers like myself i 'm not going to be too concerned about a difference of 6 mb actual 122 mb instead of 128 mb all i 'm concerned about is will the card retain the data in a consistent accurate and dependable manner not like what happened to the poor guy who lost his using a sandisk memory card the price is right too i 've had this simpletech 128 mb sd card for 2 years now and have n't had one single problem with it
i bought one of these for my magellan meridian gps green brown it works flawlessly and is much cheaper than the magellan brand secure digital cards note depending upon what version of the firmware you have for your magellan meridian you may need to upgrade to access this large of a memory card
some sort of insurance policy is always a good idea for expensive electronics so this was a no brainer
i was burned by another company with i bought their product and they did n't offer a replacement plan the item died and no one can repair it
i am very happy with my there are one or two things that i am not too pleased about number one being the mmc once you load one that you have stored books on back into your ebookman to read later on is that its takes forever for it to bring the books up to read also its makes up the ebookman you end up having to download the os applications again or it wo n't sync the second thing is its hard finding places that you can find to download music from onto your ebookman but since i mainly use mine to for ebooks that 's is great by me thanks again for this product i can carry so my books with me now to choose to read from now
straight forward you should buy this here 's the pro 's and cons pro 's 1 it has a nice screen even though it is b w that would never get in the way the screen is nice and large perfect for the person with 3 different font sizes you can see it in your way 2 it has a lot of features it has a book reader mobipocket reader a nice program player date book calculater audio book player and address book plus you can download programs from places such as windows market place or c net 3 it has handwriting recignition or a touch screen keyboard i always found this handy and while it 's not always right the people at franklin really got this down 4 the whole thing is touch screen this means you can play games on it and not be restricted to only a certian area i had this problem with my last pda this also means you can download games 5 mmc cababilty you can have gigabytes plus the on the ram the ebookman also allows you to back up data a handy feature for battery drainage 6 the software is easy to use the simple drag and system is a breeze while some people say that downloading the os operating system from the site is a pain they did n't mention that the cd already comes with the os 7 convienient side scroll wheel with push in ability you can use this instead of the scroll bars and you can push the wheel in to enter it 's cool ! con 's 1 the batteries go fast ! i advise to have a spare set and back up the data on an mmc do n't use the backlight that is what burns it up the handy thing is that it has a battery indicator so you know when it is time to change up 2 limited file types the ebookman allows mostly its own versions of files such as audio books and ebooks however it does accept notepad and music plus a bunch more 3 while it has a speaker if you plan to lisen to something you should bring some headphones the speaker is nice yet quiet 4 the date book 's alarm is very quick what is cool about the alarms is that there is over 20 alarms that you can choose however the alarm only does one cycle and then it stops it uses an internal speaker so you can barely here it while it is in a pocket otherwise the ebookman is pretty good while i got this from my aunt and did n't pay a penny i think that if this is your first pda it 's a good choice to get it for your money and if it is true that this is your first time you also want to get a case screen protectors and mmc cards for more memory this wo n't total up to more than 20 many say the batteries are drained quickly this is true in about 2 weeks for frequent users however if you do not use the backlight much you will be the backlight for the 7 inch screen is the burner of all batteries watch the convienient battery power indicator and you should be that 's what i think the desision is up to you
i bought one of these when they were on clearance for less than 30 and it works wonderfully a lot of the complaints out there are because people do n't know how to use this device correctly 1 you have approximately 30 seconds to change the batteries once the aaas are out of the unit the memory is kept alive through the use of a capacitor i know i 've tried it myself so do n't wait until the batteries are dead to change them that defeats the purpose and as with any electronic device you should have a spare set of batteries on hand 30 seconds is a lot of time if you ca n't change the batteries in 30 seconds well then 2 the little humming noise that i 've experienced is only when the backlight is on this is nothing more than stepped up voltage powering the el backlight 3 there is an onboard file manager if you ca n't find the file you 're looking for you can even assign to each file the folder under which it should appear to a limited extent works better with program files if that does n't work then the synch software should display your file 4 i have a game pacman periodic table of the elements a few songs on my mmc some books that were free off the internet and lots of other neat little programs everything works fine music quality is amazing for something that i think is slower than my ok it 's not that good but for less than 30 it makes one cheap '' player 5 the character recognition system is in my opinion much easier to use and remember than that of other pdas palm comes to mind it more closely matches how normal people write 6 you can backup all of your files to a mmc that way if you forget to change the batteries in a few months you can always restore the system from the mmc which is much faster and more convenient than reinstalling from scratch again all it takes is a standard backup like you would a pc all in all this is a great device there are a lot of free software out there for this device and if you know how to use it correctly it should be a joy to have
i bought the ebookman 901 without knowing anything about it and i have been very pleasantly surprised at how versatile it is just add a 128 mb mmc card which are now pretty reasonable on and you can have 2 hours of music to go ! i have another 64 mb mmc card in it on which i have all the books i have downloaded a 64 mb card will hold almost 100 regular books ! the mobipocket reader is great for casual reading and the franklin reader has all the navigation features to make it great for references i can read any book in html or txt format and there are thousands for free on the web the ebookman also has some nice accessories like a car stereo adaptor and an ac adaptor for home use the pda functions like address book and memo book and date book are very handy there are some really fun games i take this unit when i am traveling and am never bored i think if you read the manual and learn how to use it properly you will love this device and now you can find them on and heartland america for less than 50 bucks wow
i 've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed this is not true if you 're carefull first of all my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned off when you change the batteries pretty simple huh also do n't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it the main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner and i just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10 i primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and i love it
needed a large quantity of cds for a college course these did the job nicely
i used several high speed disks to burn music cd for my 1998 car however they just can not be readable but this has multiple written speeds so it can burn a great cd suitbale for the old cd in my car as well as new cd of course
i 've been using these memorex for years and have no problems with their reliability have used them with multiple cd and dvd burners without compatibility issues this was another and i continue to be happy with this product
i like these cdrs the payback sounds great only problem i have is that i use nero and i dont know if its nero or the cdr 's sometimes they dont burn right so i will have to assume its the program or my burner i like these they take abuse good cdrs for the money i reccomend i
we buy these because the price is low and you get 50 cd 's in a pack this is handy for backing up the pc uh when did you last back up your data you can put pictures files music on these cds we use them just for data backup and use fellowes software and labels to make custom labels with contents these are filed in an album and it 's easy to reload or retrieve data in this manner we have not had any problem writing or reading these cds
i have found that for the most part if i purchase a name brand product i usually get good quality these memorex cd 's have been working just fine for me
the product arrive to me in very good condition will recommend this product to anyone who needs blank cd
not sure what it is but my rom seems to find these disks quicker and likes burning to them because there done faster then others with the same ratings
best price great bargain for good quality medi
i use these primarily to record music compilations from my cd collection i originally intended to use them in the car during long trips i was very please and surprised to find that they sound teriffic on my high end stereo rig as well giving up only the smallest amount of resolution and detail losses that only an audio nut like myself would detect
first off i 'm old ish in my 50 's and i watched my daughter using her ipod nano then she started playing me songs from her ipod then i started really liking some of the songs then i got jealous so i asked for my own for my birthday so i got the biggest and newest and i love it it has fantastic sound i play it in my car i also use it to listen to audiobooks i ca n't wait to watch movies on it it is also very easy to use so i give it 5 stars
i love my new ipod i bought this one after my ipod photo was misplaced '' i had a library of about songs small for what this thing can hold and the first time i updated the new ipod with the library i got error messages every 700 songs or so i had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until i finally got al my songs into the ipod this was problem number one which i do n't expect to happen again unless i update the ipod whith more than 700 songs at a time problem number two if i 'm searching for a song by artist it wo n't display all the songs i have by that artist in the ipod say i have like 20 songs by madonna and i search for madonna on the artists menu i only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are that did n't happen with my old ipod but all in all it 's a great product and i would buy it all over again if i had to
i have the black video ipod and it 's awesome sleek sexy and built like a little tank i love itunes and the latest version is great
what else can i say but it 's excellent ! ! ! i enjoy using it traveling with it using it to carry music and video 's and talking books back and forth to work the only thing it needs is a convienient way to hook it up to my car speaker system with out major surgery
i love it but i think i would like the the ipod
i am happy with my purchase i have n't had a chance to test it fully yet but it has been performing as expected to this point and with twice the capacity of my laptop ! i 've got a lot of room to work with
i have a number of toys in my older age and the apple is clearly a favorite ! i use it in the car i use it with my home system i use it for music enjoyment first and then and occasional audio book i also use it during a workout when i travel or get stuck waiting somewhere for something i will use the video all the functions work great it 's easy to use and it does so much it 's just about ridiculous it 's the mother of all gadgets if you buy one and you will be glad i recommend getting a protective case for it just to keep it looking like new this compact wonder is one of the few things in life that will give me my moneys worth and more
hi i recently got this system from and put it with the philips 23 '' flat screen lcd tv i bought from together these are great i have had no problem with the dvd play and i love having a radio tuner built in one less appliance needed and with lovely sound granted i live in a small apartment and i doubt i would turn the sound up to really take advantage of the system do n't want the neighbors calling but for the price it is perfect and the two together look great in my home and perform very well
i purchased this amazing home theater system at sam 's club i also purchased a phillips plasma tv together these two make beautiful music when i first heard this amazing home theater i could n't believe how good it sounded it reminded me of a more expensive bose system for a fraction of the price my friends always ask me how much i paid for it thinking i spent a fortune but i did not i paid 189 on sale i even use it as my regular home stereo i got ta tell you my cd 's have never sounded better the subwoofer produces amazing deep bass and the highs are out of this world get this you wo n't regret it ! i 've had mine for 3 weeks with no problem at all ! ! !
works very well i ran my cd and dvd test subjects '' thru about 10 times and the discs would physically start to curl up like a potato chip which would further prevent any attempt to read them of course i was just playing around with this new toy but i think just once thru the unit will really mess up any chances at recovery of data also my box bought via office depot included five software titles reportedly worth 149.99 1. hacker smacker firewall 2. stop spam 3. internet cleanup 4. stuffit standard edition 5. restore it 3 and 2 more bonuses 1. free subscription to the spamslicer program home edition or 50.00 off the business edition i 'm not going to type it all out but details of what spam slicer is and the program available to anyone that buys this unit are available at 2. id theft prevention final conclusion i think this item is more than sufficient for the home small business user norazza company offers larger data disc destroyer units for folks that need to destroy massive quantities of discs on a regular basis 2 thumbs up
i was looking for an innovative product that could quickly and affordably destroy a large number of i work for a small business and we have lots of disks to be destroyed on a regular basis this was an instant solution and very affordable we are so pleased that we plan on making it mandatory to have on everyone 's desktop ! do n't hesitate buy it now ! ! !
i work for a small business and we ca n't afford the risks of data theft having this unit has put my mind to ease especially since i work with very sensitive data if you love gadgets this is an extremely cool product to have its sleek and within seconds destroys your data its very compact and heavy duty so its durable and can easily fit in a home office as well as any place at work you just insert the disc and within seconds thousand of tiny imprints are made on both sides of the disc making the disc unreadable this is a great product because it securely destroys the data without having to shred the disc and having shattered broken pieces of plastic everywhere for anyone who has owned or operated a disc shredder they are very messy this is an excellent alternative is so quick and easy to use anyone can operate it this should be a household requirement as much as any other appliance in your home i received my norazza data destroyer within a couple days of placing my order which was very fast service i strongly recommend this product for personal as well as for business use ! ! !

i dont speak english i am from your product is verry good thanks
for an inexpensive jump drive i found this one to be very good it was easy to use and convenient for transferring pictures from my computer to a printing station at the local photo developers
this is truely an awesome product it is so easy to use and holds a ton of data
pros than other flash drives a lock switch a ring so you can hook it up with your keys being washed in the washing machine i waited a day for it to dry up when i plugged it back in the pc the data that i had before remained intact cons purple body scratches easily especially if you keep it with your keys -128 mb might be a little too small for some people
i bought my lexar jumpdrive when the cost was much higher and i still consider it a bargain large enough for most storage requirements small enough to carry around in my pocket it 's a perfect solution to so many computer needs ! i have to switch files among several computers my mac at home my pc at work a mac laptop and a pc laptop i do n't know how i did it before i had my lexar
i puchased this jumpdrive over 2 years ago and i have no complaints in fact i would like to purchase the 1 gb jumpdrive
this is a fantastic product i use it to store work on and my boss and i swap back and forth using each other 's jump drives great for making your business portable
nine bucks for i still have a lap top with a hard drive this little baby is so low priced and convenient it makes zip disks and cdr 's seem just stupid the clear colored plastic is cool because you can see the guts this one is a no brainer if you want to be able to grab stuff on the fly do n't leave home without it
this product really does make a difference i had an older cd player that was doing a lot of skipping and sometimes it would not function at all i ran the cleaning disc through it once and now it 's working just fine great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year certainly beats having to buy a new cd or dvd player
i was ready to replace the cd player in my honda odyssey much skipping and would not even play many of my cds two quick cycles with this product less than two minutes and the player is as good as new
over the course of the last few months my cd player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a cd at all 5 minutes after my package arrived with this cd cleaner in it and i was playing cds again i can also play cdrs now something my stereo has n't been able to do for six months
my cd player was very dusty and it would not play very clearly i used this product and it helped greatly
when you first look at this cleaner one ca n't think how simple ! it looks like a compact disc with tiny brushes on it my cd player was not playing correctly after using the cleaner it works perfectly great product
i bought for our computer because it was n't working properly and once i put in my cd cleaner it started working very good so now everytime the on my computer starts acting up and just pop in my cleaner and it 's good to go
this product is awesome like another reviewer i had a problem with my cd player playing my homemade mix cds but i used this cleaner and 30 seconds later everything is perfect ! ! ! thanks
i first bought a monster product equivalent in bestbuy and it absolutely sucked after buying this i am very happy i did it works just how it says it does
before i had this i had a generic cassette adapter the sound was horrible and it made a terrible tinny echo i bought it for my ford taurus which costs 800 to add a cd changer to my wireless fm adapter sounded better than my generic cassette adapter and it was static city since the antenna is on the opposite side of the car station wagon i was pleasantly surprised when i got this adapter to replace my old one the sound quality is better than the strongest fm station here and the coiled cord really reduces the mess in my car i only had one problem with this and i think that is because of my car stereo but i will note it anyway after 10 minutes of playing my car stereo would switch to side 2 then side 1 and display and eject the tape after getting very angry i found a solution simply take the adapter apart spray on all the gears and remove the small gear assembly that prevents the rape from being rewound was this even necessary there is no physical tape so it does n't matter if someone tries to rewind it problem solved ! i would definitely get this over any other adapter
somebody was thinking when they designed this adapter the plug that works for either style cassete player the one where the small end of the cassete goes in first or the one where the wide side goes in first plus the curly cord that does n't get in the way the big bonus is the price it 's half the cost of the monster adapter and it works great the reviews of the monster adapter are very poor i first bought a dlo transpod 2 fm transmitter big mistake the sound was about 80 static as there was n't any line of sight between the transpod and the car antenna if you have a car where the antenna is molded into the rear window it probably would work better anyway this adapter and my ipod sound great over my car stereo there are a few car cassette players that wo n't work with a adapter if one adapter does n't work none will
i agree with the others that have provided a favorable review i am pleasantly surprised with many aspects of the product it feels like a quality product it is very quiet in the player having only a light sound of clicking '' which does not impair the reproduction of the music the sound is very clear and not distorted i am very pleased with it
it 's very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother maybe it seemed a little quiet but that depends on the volume adjustings i might buy another for the other car and its value definitely exceeds the price that i paid
i used to buy energizers and duracells at a pop for four batteries now i buy generic alkalines at costco cost 8 for 10 four packs it 's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer according to a recent coprehensive story in consumer reports there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries
theyre friggin ' batteries what else can i say they last ok and cost no big deal
i have used energizer batteries for many years and i have found that they work much better than duracell or anyother battery these batteries are especiall great for handheld devices like walkmans and gameboys the battery life is extrodinary
for the most part i just want to keep it short i usually always by energizer cause they 're reasonably priced and seem to last much much longer then most other battery products that i have used in the past
these batteries are as good as any and well priced to
these batteries are great and seem to fit my rio 500 better than some discount batteries good price too
these are by far the best batteries you can get they last 5 times longer than standard alkaline batteries they look cool and they weigh almost nothing you 'll love being able to save lots of cash by not constantly running to the store for batteries and the fact that your portable electronic will weigh less ! i 've used these numerious times in many different electronic devices and i love these batteries ! try them ! you wo n't be sorry
i really like this key board i find it to be verys responsive and unlike some other reviewers i have n't found that i have to press the keys and longer or harder then i do with a normal keyboard i often leave a gaming keyset on even when i 'm not playing my only complaint is that there is not a good instruction manual i got this keyboard mainly to play wow as anyone knows there are many commands in that game and in that respect the learning curve to fully use my keyset has been a little high i also have the age of empires iii keyset and i have the same complaint all in all i am very happy with this product i only wish it had better support
i ordered the keyboard and keypad combo for 53 the keyset comes from tigerdirect and shipped immediatly the zboard shipped from amazon took a week to ship and 11 days to arrive ! ! someone explain this one to me amazon the product is great has all the necessary keys believe me ive tried the merc and the zboard fang all of those didnt have critical keys like change vehicle position or camera or map but for some reason on all their zboard units they swap with cycle weapons e with f why i liked where it was and was used to it i never used cycle weps i would just hit the number key for that wep or scroll the mouse both faster i wish these guys would just quit thinking they know better how to lay out my controls they could just give us a pad of some sort with all keys and let us set it up to suit us but they have to muck it up at least just leave the keys postions alone guys
the zboard is the next best thing to having a voice activated keyboard that writes for you its great for anything you want to do if your a gamer get this keyboard it has changeable keypads for all the best new games and it helps a lot ! if your new or experienced this is a great keyboard and the best part is it works for typing as well the zboard has a layout specifically designed for typing and searching on the web so it 's good for everyone not just hardcore gamers i love this keyboard
this is a very good keyboard for games 'cause it 's cool to have bigger directional keys very comfortable it 's kinda hard at the beginning to type because now u have like a reduced version of ur keyboard in the right side but it 's just a matter of time and practice very good keyboard i really like it
i purchased the zboard after seeing it for sale in the store i have long wanted a keyboard that made gaming easier and this seemed to fit the bill the keyboard is easy to use with its interchanging lay overs for normal qwerty style typing or its many custom game styles although it took a little getting used to a first i have found that gaming goes smoother and easier now equally important no more mistaken keyboard keys being hit while in active bullets flying bombs bursting combat i have used the battlefield 2 set and qwerty set the only downside to the keyboard is that if you intend to type a message while gaming you will get really screwed up trying to figure out where the keys are now located on the keyboard i try to use the speech channels instead of typing was it worth the money yes certainly after i bought it on where the cost was lower so after shipping i saved a couple of bucks under the suggested retail price on the company web site and no shipping expense on top of that
well constructed and worked right out of the box we are anxious for more gaming templates how about templates for ms flight simulator and the different planes
hello as i said this keyboard made my play a lot easier with the shortcute that it have on it and i can change the keys as i like from game to game but i hope they expande the coverage of the games that they have there keys it worth to try it
i bought one just bought 2 more this dvd player is a gem for the money i 'm on a very busy schedule so i ca n't verify what i 'm going to say here but i belive i 'm playing hd on this unit i downloaded some hd clips thru bittorrent and usually have to play these on my pc connected to the hd monitor i copied these avi and mpeg clips to a dvd popped them in this player and watched outstanding clear hd quality vid on my hdtv monitors i do n't know if there is some upscanning or down scanning going on between this dvd player and my norcent 32 '' hdtv but my eye is seeing 1080 resolution and images so sharp i cna see the goose bumps on an olympic swimmer i do n't know about reliability but there 's junk in all batches of china made electronics but if this player was sold for i would still buy one of them after seeing hd quality content on my monitor i 'd say unless you 're spending your last buy this unit and take a chance on the claimed quality issues here i 'm sold ! bill
this little player performs excellently remote takes a lot of getting the feel of it if you are in the the formala and it turns into a player the dvd player is excellent but the romote could definitly be improved
i was looking for an affordable dvd player and found this one it has been working very well for nearly a month and i am very satisfied it can not play absolutely everything but it is a bargain especially if you do n't play too different dvd formats recommended
this dvd player played movies which i could not run even on my laptop almost every cd dvd in my huge movie collection written using a variety of different formats divx mpeg etc all ran smoothly without absolutely any problems for the price this deal is a steal
well this is a simple usb 2.0 hub everything worked as advertised i had a problem when plugging the ac unit into a socket that already has another power adaptor from compusa it made my compusa adaptor whine
great product never had a single problem with it to date and i 've now been using it for 2.5 months plug and play and that 's it beauty i 'm considering ordering a one for all my stuff
i have been using this hub for about six months the power light started flickering after about three months and now does n't light at all the hub works great but i wonder how long it will last
for my older pc this made it easy to access a usb 2 port without crawling around to the back of the computer it does require power for full functionality but does just what i need it to do for a reasonable price
we bought this powered hub for a desktop because some of our devices were not being recognized as usb 2.0 and we finally tracked the problem down to a power issue the was immediately recognized by windows xp further two devices that previously registered individually as usb 1 when connected directly to a usb port were immediately shown as usb 2 when both were simultaneously connected to the hub the price was right as is the performance we recommend it
i had been using a belkin hub my computer was constantly reporting low usb power i 'd have to unplug something to get something else working since i replaced it with the no more low usb messages no more as a matter of fact i had previously replaced my linksys router which i had to reset from time to time with a i 've never had to reset the obviously makes very good products i highly recommend products
does just what it says it will do was easy to install
i use my usb hub every day and it works fine with every device i plug into it
i 've had this hub for two months and have had no problems with it installation was a snap as it should be for a basic hub the hub is small and a bit too light but it 's definitely not for laptop users as it needs an ac adapter the power brick is actually smaller than most other adapters and rises straight up from the prongs saving you space on power strips that have the plugs aligned vertically or on wall outlets a nice touch i have an ipod and a multifunction printer attached to the hub and have had no problems with either a word of warning however as other reviewers have noted if you plug a usb 1.0 device into the hub all usb 2.0 devices will slow down to 1.0 speeds
this is very well designed it give you 4 usb port but two on opposite sides this is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides you webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right the cord that plug in from the hub to the computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the hub in all kind of angles it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires it also works great if you jsut want to charge you usb devices on the go it come with a plug in ac adapter so you do n't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices
i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must '' plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin
pros small cute comes with a power adaptor i have 6 devices hooked up to it including 2 usb hard drives and it works fine without the adapter a big plus for me most hubs would not work with this setup usb 2.0 1.1 6 devices hooked up 3 low speed and 3 high speed all work very well runs cool cons not sure why but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and ports on the other this is dumb if you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward all ports should be on the back and leds on the front here the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you do n't see them the hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated overall the best hub i 've ever had and i tried many
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue
you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires i keep my cpu under the table only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price
this hub takes care of old power issues i had with smaller unpowered hubs it is handling my pda usb jump drive high capacity external drive and printer and i still have 3 more ports and i have n't had any usb power alerts from my computer since i added this hub it does what it says
this system is just what i wanted it is small powerful and easy to us
this truly was so easy to set up including programming all the wonderful features the sound is fabulous and the unit is so compact and looks very nice i 'm very happy with my purchase and the price was great too
wonderful sound and nice bass small and easy directions to remote simple to a great complete uni
i 've had it for about 2 months already and it has worked without any flaws the only thing you have to be aware is to use good media to burn audio cds and because if not it will skip seconds while playing but other than that sound is perfect and it has lots of power for it 's size you wo n't go wrong with panasonic
this panasonic is all right except i would die to get my old sony system back they just do n't have the sound quality at panasonic that sony had with these small systems i do n't like that i do n't have a clock display at all times and sometimes the cd changer is confusing to me but it will just take time to figure it out since these kind of bookshelf stereos are becoming more obsolete i am happy to have this one with all the sound quality of the sonys i have owned i 've gone through a half dozen it will please me if this just hangs on and does not become a disappointment in functionality i would like this one to hang around longer hopefully the cd reader will not go out like my sonys did
hands down this is the best budget stereo system for the price period
i recently bought this stereo for my living room i 'm very very satisfied it was pretty easy to set up the sound is also very wonderful the bass and treble features are great too 5 disc changer is a plus i recommend this product to anyone who 's looking for a good stereo ipod users need to buy a in order to plug their ipod into the music port
i bought this model in order to be rid of my sony with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner having once owned an earlier model this new panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint like its predecessor the is a nice powerful compact stereo with for the money ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner especially on the fm band it can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses the remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual right now this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning sony 's competing models are hog attention on store shelves bigger take more more to ship and consequently suffer certain measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified and of course proprietary antenna connector it 's like choosing between the pontiac and the toyota the sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of bling the panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture
it was very easy to put together and takes up minimum space however the sound is not minimal and is great for my needs i particularly like the equalizer for both my pop and classical music the radio with the antenna has great sound with little static the cd player is great for my needs easy to play just one cd or the entire deck my only quibble is that it has a single cassette deck and is not auto reversible but that 's a small price for having a system with great sound instruction book as most books are could use a little ironing out but i was able to get started and if you have set up a shelf system before this should be a breeze if you have n't set one up before you should have no trouble
i mainly bought this for its reliability of outlets and most of all the cleanpower feature funky dirty ac power is one of the leading causes of shortened life expectancy for electronics some things i noticed yes it is plastic but it has that good thick plastic feel not the cheap thin stuff that seems like it would crack when dropped it can be hung in virtually any direction horiz diag vert from two by two hole patterns on the back of the unit the cord is long and thick the plug is a angle type that can be used in either the top or bottom outlet receptacle huh it is not only but it doesnt hang straight down from the receptacle imagine you plugged this into a clock face the plug would be angled toward the 4 '' or 5 '' on the face so that you are n't limited to plugging it in the bottom plug you could actually have two of these plugged into the same outlet enough about that the plug connectors are really tight fitting you 'll see what i mean when you go to plug in the computer or whatever all monster outlets are this way and are intended to help keep the plug from falling out or being ripped out by accident another way monster cable thinks about the small things that bug us mine came with a phone cable that was a couple feet or so in length cool now i can plug the fax through the connectors on the unit nothing to report there the power switch lights up in red comes with labels to help indentify both ends of the power cabes you are plugging in the three transformer '' positions are great for those old box plugs for the cameras and such plenty of room built in i highly recommend this unit for your computer
this is the surge plug that i have purchased the first one met an untimely death do to a major water spill from a fish aquarium but all the equipment attached to it survived all in all these plugs are the best each plug is labled and you get tags to label your cords a nice feature if all your plugs are same color and style the added area for power packs is a nice touch as those take up so much room
it is worth the i hooked up all my electronics to it the plugs are held extremely tight and they will not fall out the picture on my monitor is less shaky also the cord on it is extremely long and the plug is almost flat to the wall it is also a great deal because it comes with labels for the wires and locking cable ties i have bought one for my pc and tv
i just bought a new computer and i new if i ever needed a new surge protector monster would have what i need this baby has it all clearly marked 3 prong plugs for the computer monitor printer scanner modem speakers and two extras it also includes phone line protection from impulses and discharges caused from surge pulses you need this ! without this i 've lost two modems from storms 30 minutes away ! it includes a since long power line which is heavily insolated other bonuses include the 1665 joule rating the gold contact grounded plug little stickers to mark your cables with and a monster phone line cable i also like its attractive look most are white and stand out since this model is black it appears a little secluded on my desk but that 's not all you 're backed with a grantee this baby will not fail if it does you are covered my monster 's insurance ! that 's worth 50 bucks alone
i purchased this unit due to frequent blackouts in my area and 2 power supplies going bad it will run my cable modem router pc and lcd monitor for 5 minutes this is more than enough time to save work and shut down equally important i know that my electronics are receiving clean power i feel that this investment is minor compared to the loss of valuable data or the failure of equipment due to a power spike or an irregular power supply as always amazon had it to me in 2 business days
first of all why do you want a power ups there are some very good reasons 1 you never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout 2 you want to work with clean power only 3 you want to monitor your pc power 4 you want to prevent your pc from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection the first rule about ups is to never trust the insurance claim get your pc insured elsewhere these companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims i have a pc running some very high specifications with over six usb devices lcd monitor printer and ethernet equipment with everything on at the same time i have never gone above of usage and average between and when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks even though i have a power supply unit psu i will be upgrading to a psu because it is better quality model the way i can monitor how many watts i use is with ups software and hardware so the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using the short answer to this is you do n't know until you install the ups and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time you need to estimate what it is i would say a domestic pc not a server would use max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on as soon as we add things like another pc or several printers or several monitors then we can start to overload a ups this brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any ups overloading and balancing the overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the ups capacity overloading does two things it can in theory eventually damage the ups and it voids the warranty most ups are but there are and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one pc setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups for a network so check the ups rating what ups you choose depends on how much you want to load on it next thing you need to check with the ups is if it comes with a usb connection if it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your pc and the ups comes with software now if the ups has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off ups sound alarms controlling how your ups handles a blackout how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation if it sounds an alarm or not if it run self tests data collection and monitoring notifications and sensitivity settings if the ups does not come with a usb connection and software then you probably should be looking for an ups designed for computer use rather than a ups for equipment most ups have led indicators that tell you the status of the unit the next thing to understand is that testing your ups is not done by breaking it out of the box connecting it to the mains plugging your pc in and then turning off the house 's power with the circuit breaker you must charge the ups first ! so read the instructions usually you must attach the battery to the ups plug it in firmly ! and wait before using it then perform the test using the software first ! then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the pc stays up usually a ups is programmed to shutdown your pc if the blackout lasts for a few seconds nearly all ups models with a usb connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the pc should hold for on the ups battery most ups devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem this is important because power surges on a ups that do not have this protection can damage a pc through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the pc somehow this is nasty problem with the degree of security that a ups can provide if it does n't have this function then it is not going to provide 100 surge protection with a pc that is networking a ups pc to another pc without ups can also increase the risk of surge protection problems it is not recommend that you network a ups pc to a pc unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue one last thing is that some ups have input regions on the ups for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot this is everything you need to know about an ups before you choose one it is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the ups and making sure it provides you with what you need the two top brands are apc and belkin
we bought this to backup the imac that i got my wife for christmas i have had an apc since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area the overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money i 'm not sure if the powerchute software was updated to run on mac tiger howvever so i did not install it steve reis
it 's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power this person obviously did n't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the ups the notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software i agree that i was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem luckily it was easy to turn this feature off five stars for this product for sure
i ordered 3 apc es on the recommendation of an employee of mine who used to work at apc i 've had them for about a month now without any problems they 've functioned properly through a few unexpected power interruptions i 'll gladly order more if the need arises pros large plug spacing good for power adapters simple design long cord cons no line conditioning usually an expensive option
i replaced an older apc uninterruptible power supply with this one i like the power bar design which makes it easy to use it includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night it has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out one tip if you have a spare backup outlet plug your electronic phone in that way you wo n't be disconnected if there 's a momentary power outage
i already knew how good this product was before we bought it we had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer i have recently learned i might have been able to have that replaced if i had thought to follow up but i was just so thrilled to have only lost an 80.00 at that time product and not a computer when ordering mine the price had come down quite a bit since we had first purchased one i got free shipping i never even had to leave the house ! i could n't be happier ! !
wish the unit had a separate light when power to the unit is missing the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds the warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it is n't always easy to tell what is happening
electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks usually at night but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work this backup battery takes care of that problem very well it comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events the software isnt of the best design but it works no linux software but it can still be used without it the unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery i have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it
sandisk cf is all i have never had a problem one card went through the wash and still works perfectly
in general i have realised that cf cards have a years life this is my cf card in 5 years and my sandisk card my first also sandisk is still working but its only so not very useful on long trips except as backup with a 5 megapixel canon this card stores about 200 highest resolution images have used this for only 3 months so far but have noted that the ultra ii is definitely faster than others quality and life seems to be better than the viking cards i have used but time will have to tell how true that is
my compact flash card works just fine good here very fast a very happy custome
i was thinking about buying a card but after reading one of the reviews i bought two 512 card just in case that something went wrong which to me made a lot of sense i 'm please
i bought this card about 6 months ago when i received a nikon coolpix 5700 as a gift i have to say this card has never let me down it writes images like there 's no tomorrow and it has n't failed me once i have n't lost a single image and i do n't plan on it while using this card sandisk has done it once again buy from amazon i paid 20 more staples for it
i 'm not beholden to the sandisk brand and did quite a bit of research and the overall reviews tend to point to this product as a great value in fact the ultra ii '' title does live up to its name and am very happy with the performance of this product canon takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace even at the highest resolution download is speedy too i went for two cards instead of a single card for redundancy keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason highly recommended
i have always been very pleased with the sandisk products i would highly recommend them
after reading reviews on every brand sold at amazon i picked pioneer since it was about the only brand that did n't have any complaints i have only had it for a few days but the unit does exactly what is supposed to and does it excellent it uses disks only but since i never have used disks that option is irrevelent to me
when i first got the headphones i was frustrated they seemed quiet not much bass did n't sound that great what i 've read in other reviews is very true having them seated in your ear properly makes all the difference ! i do n't normally like things inside my ears but i pushed it in farther and made them seat right and now very nice not as loud as my other pairs of headphones but they do n't need to be they also cut out like of outside noise which means you do n't need as much volume i 've actually used these on plane trips just to cut out noise even though i was n't listening to music at the time i hope you enjoy them as i do
great sound quality although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt i recommend keeping the setting on bass '' because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear the case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of it takes to get them properly in there other than those minor issues its great i prefer these over any creative earbuds
one thing you will read in reviews when people first use the headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are not reccomended to use while running bycycling or driving a car i use them for long airplane flights long walks between classes and relaxing at home and these headphones are fantastic once you get it situated in your ear correctly it takes a few tries to figure it out you wo n't want to take them off they are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format if all of your music is encoded in at you ar n't doing yourself justice i have some songs in apple losses and some in acc vbr and i am very happy with the sound quality the clip located about inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla bass and high definition the bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly for those who complain that the earphones are n't loud enough and the high definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat overall i am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them they are worth much more than the 67.00 i paid for them
these earphones are great quality the sound is good and they fit comfortably in the ear once you get used to them two minuses make them only 4 out of 5 stars first the customer support is weak there is supposed to be a website for the product for customer support and replacement parts but altec lansing his it linked to a seemingly unrelated product second the volume control is a little heavy unless you have somewhere to clip it to this might be a problem for runners
i purchased these headphones because i needed isolation from noise and these did the trick the sound quality is great and the quality of the headphones themselves is first rate the noise isolation is good for work planes anywhere the noise level is too high irecommend them for the price
first these phones are great but i want them in if you do n't get a good ear seal they will sound treble is silky the mids are natural and the bass is tight well defined and should know bass i 'm a bass player of 40 years and it 's like being at a live sells these for 73 with nextday yours take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price it 's the best deal out sound quality is sony are from bassin j
after using my for about 4 months now i have a few things to say about them 1 price lists for 199 on altec 's site 70 is a steal 2 quality top notch in the earphones the clip on the volume module is weak 3 performance bar none best i 've had these things outperform the huge logitech ear muff set i use mainly to mow in these things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower 4 conclusion the only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way when moving around you need to have it clipped to something otherwise it can create inner ear noise this can get quite annoying i 've also caught the cord on things causing the clip to bend away from the module it is removeable and i was able to bend it back if there were a pair of equal quality the module even for the same price i 'd go that route with that said i am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my video ipod
this is not my first inearmonitor purchase prior to the i have been using etymotics both amped and unamped which i had considered the absolute for the buck monitors my background includes an interest in '' since around 1960 and several years with guitar string bass piano etc are the new champs in the under 250 price category and strongly comparable to shure and ety negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem 's are insertion is directed to the front and upwards this is the natural direction of the ear canal also do n't be afraid of going too deep with them you can not hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal the is very good in presenting the details of a recording they are derived from etymotic drivers but they are also very my personal choice of tips for them is shure softflex they fit perfectly if you need foamies then comply works very well the only questionable choice made by altec lansing was to put an resistor module with them giving you a choice of using them unamped from a player or switching the module to hd position for more refined sound which is best when amped imo module also has a volume control the downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line while i do n't like this module for my usage i can see where others could rejoice in its ' inclusion the design is very attractive and i sometimes think of getting a second pair of them simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me these 's are now my choice for portable listening
i had been shopping for a pair of headphones with the ability to block out background noise for sometime now since i work in a loud environment i had been really shy about buying this pair or any for that matter because some reviews were n't favorable i was nervous however i bought these because of the name altec lansing has in audio i was shocked when i first listened to them i had to replace the rubber tips and use the foam ones because the rubber ones were just not that comfortable but wow ! the clarity of these phones are incredible no matter what others said about these i found the bass to be tight but not booming if someone wants booming bass like what would be heard in nightclubs then they need to stay away from headphones period if you are searching for a pair of iems then if i were you i would seriously consider this pair just make sure the seal is tight and they are in all the way which i never really found that to be an issue i do n't really understand what others were doing wrong with that if you bought these i highly recommend it you would not be sorry i am thouroughly impressed with mine
this product works well you can change the base part in order to fit a variety of holders theres room to plug in an fm transmitter on the port dock on the underside i can even fit my ipod in this with a speck silicone case on it which is convenient
great produce much more conveinient when you have multilpe riders in the car so that they can share
after i bought my ipod a charger a tape adapter an fm broadcaster a case a running wheel and a water bottle i decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car these little belkin numbers are quite nifty they hold the ipod in a nice position in my cupholder such that i can glance down at it instead of picking it up when i need to review the songs overall a nifty product now even better that it 's a little cheaper
with a price here on amazon far better than some of the stores this was an easy purchase to make my car has unusually large cupholders yet by simply flipping the base of the tunedok over i still managed to get a tight fit with no wobbling for my ipod
if your ipod has a protective cover skin casing etc then the ipod will not fit in the holder of this kit otherwise you can fit a bare uncovered ipod on it well the kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes including adjustable cupholders the holder swivels so you can have your ipod facing straight up or at various angles the opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the ipod the holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the ipod it actually holds the ipod well
other reviews mention three cup sizes more specifically there are cupholder inserts small and large a special bottom attachment for either of those to be used in cupholders plus a foamy cushion wrap that can be added to either of the cups for extra fill and stability that makes at least six possible combinations enough to fit any need and yes the holder tilts and the cupholder insert swivels to give you the best reading angle but it doesnt tilt too loosely you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs it 's even a bit allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt lastly the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom now top of the insert making a very nice desk stand for when i 'm not in the car
this item is very useful for my car because it does n't have any unocuppied space near to the cigarette lighter socket i find it very useful
this is perfect for my ipod and keeps it totally secure while driving great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly
i purchased this to use in my lg mobile phone i have used it for 's and has been working fine i initially had some problems with playing the 's but found that verizon had the setting turned off on the phone once i corrected this the mini sd has been working fine only once i had to eject it and reinstall it due to a read error but that may have been a function of the lg not the mini sd card no problems since
i purchased the mini sd 512 mb flash memory card for my lg 8100 to enhance the memory in the phone it was easy to install and i could use it right away also it came with an adapter for the larger sd so i can take the card to develop the pictures from the phone if i so desired
it work very good and i have found nothing wrong with it
this expansion is great now i have over 120 songs loaded in my phone great media player
if you have a flash this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots though i highly recommend this product over the light sphere as they both have about the same visual effect but the light sphere costs dramatically more this device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight no need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky this thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time looks aside what does it do it diffuses your flash 's light so you get a softer and more look to your flash no more pictures looking like you 're shining a spotlight on people this has a more natural soft light '' look to it i highly recommend it for indoor use because you 'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source and the spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room the only downside is that since it is softening the light you may need to adjust your flash output you may have to dial up your exposure meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage the tradeoff is irritating sometimes but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos
this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed the white box is for general use also available are the green for florescent lighting and the gold for a warming effect pros inexpensive solution for better flash photography a quality product that works cons reduces the amount of light cast upon subject should be expected with these types of products
i am probably one of the most impared people on the planet i rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards i only notice substantial jumps in sound technology i am very reserved about getting soundcards as i dont think i ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound i have gone from a adlib to a sb to to audigy ls and now to this card that being said this is probably the last card i will even pick up or need the sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards and is amazing clear i love the front panel for adding my headphones if i need them i couldnt be happier with the price i paid or the product itself amazing buy i cant say enough good things i dont speak geek about the improvements its like you know what you like and i love this card
everything i have tried to do with the sound card has been easy to do great sound great hardware and good software
i have had the platinum for about one month i upgraded from soundblaster 5.1 a big upgrade i have an asus motherboard amd processor and nvidia video and have not had any problems at all i got the card to record vinyl to cd i have about 500 albums the advantage of the connections straight from the amp to the card were the selling point i have recorded some albums over 30 years old and they sound fine the recording software that came with the card works just fine from simple record to three levels of effects i have put recordings from the records on my and burned cd 's better sound than a casette tape and i 've just scratched the surface with the software features i have a great improvement in overall sound and there are many uses for the features on the card and the software applications that come with it all i need is more knowledge on how to use all of the features the card is expensive but worth it particularly if you have a specific use for it take the plunge and enjoy the best sound available you deserve it
first off not a perfect product far from infact takes a bit of tinkering to work right and the instructions ar n't really clear i had the audigy 2 zs before this sound card and it was a simple install card install drivers and your good to go huge improvement over the onboard this was the first problem the fact that i had drivers on my system from a previous sound blaster card had to sweep them from my system my next problem was that the drivers that come with the card are beta at best and have conflicts with motherboard chipsets and video cards but nothing that updates from there website wo n't fix the original drivers must be installed first now why would i give a sound card that ships with sub par drivers a 4 out of 5 the sound is incredible if the audigy was step up from the onboard then the is a giant leap great for games and movies
hardware was a breeze to about 20 minuets including the for the software no quality is much improved over my old live battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 9700 i would freeze framing during start in rooms and during game play in intense with the i have none of that and the game runs much smoother overall dvd movies sound much improved music is also much improved the only problem ive had burning expanded 's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far software interface is also a bit lack luster but is functional card is worth the price hopefully upgrades will improve interface
the last soundblaster i had used was a soundblaster live a couple of years ago since then i 've been relying on onboard sound on nforce based motherboards sound quality was okay but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs i decided to upgrade to the when i started to have sound dropouts while playing oblivion sound quality from the is great especially with headphones i 'm only using the drive bay panel for the headphone jack but the price of the platinum version was n't much more than just the basic card so it was money well spent if i had this set up as a media center pc the remote control functions would make this an even better deal a few notes had no problems installing this on an based motherboard asus deluxe drive bay only comes in black if you still have a tan case you 're out of luck is a digital spdif output available on the back of the card it 's a mini '' jack and unfortunately no adapter to rca jack is included
i 've been a turtle beach lover because i 'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but ca n't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio the quality turtle beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value been using santa cruz for years and it runs great after upgrading and to found the santa cruz seems to be lagging usually about glitches sudden stop of sound during playback it might be my system 's problem but anyway upgrade to montego ddl fixed the problem used optical output on montego ddl and it sounds good enough to me but montego ddl has a microphone problem too low volume that i ca n't live with so i tried only intention is to get the microphone problem fixed instead of getting better audio quality when i put it with i ca n't believe the quality it delivers i 'm not audiophile but the difference is so obvious that everyone can tell some people complain about no optical output on xtrememusic and no ddl on the whole line but you really do n't need to man the quality from 3 stereo cables at is way better than optical output from montego this is when i reallized that for audio products you need listening to compare instead of looking the spec to compare xtrememusic should be good for most people but i still bought platinum version for future proof anyway in my value not quality oriented mind i still vote for creative this time creative beats turtle beach this time beats it really hard of course the microphone is fixed too
all i can say is that they are good sleeves and they are nice to have to protect
memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect cds and dvds from lying around gathering dust the paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing cds and dvd discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage it costs less to mail cd and dvd media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same cds and dvds in slim jewel cases this savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves ! the color white is neutral and does n't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the cd or dvd i agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap this ensures that the cds and dvds do n't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another they are also useful for people who have accumulated so many cds and dvds that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room overall these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price i highly recommend these paper sleeves for people who want a practical and alternative to jewel cases
i purchased a pack of these memorex sleeves or a memorex version very similar to these at circuit city without first looking at the price i was astounished to be charged 7.99 plus tax i purchased the same sleeves at walmart later the same day for ciruit city has great prices on many things particularly electronics but these miscellaneous items can be waaaay overpriced same is true of many items at office max i am not aware of dvd or cd sleeves that are cheaper than these memorex sleeves when purchased from walmart or a simlar discounter at least and they get the job done these sleeves are fairly light paper but not nearly as light as the sleeve in which a netflix or blockbuster dvd is stored in these sleeves do have a flap so the entire cd or dvd is protected
these are simply envelopes for your cds and dvds ca n't say anything else about them except this i noticed when i opened the box they came in 'my ' sleeves were wrapped tightly with a rubber band which caused them to be somewhat crumpled upon removing the rubber band it did not really affect them adversely but just be aware that yours may come this way also
the 50 pack are all white and the window in the front is a useful feature lets you see what 's on there without resorting to opening the envelope the tab on the back helps keep the disc from falling out a nice touch
what 's to say they 're paper sleeves for cd 's
always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year
the first time i saw this piece was at i had listened to sony philips jvc panasonic rca in that order the difference was instantly clear then i went back to listen to the philips again and the difference was recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to i made up my mind that if i wanted a home theater in a box htib package it will be the philips was about 10 months ago each time i stopped by the electronic section of any store i would check it out finally i decided to buy one next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews most reviews rated it high however i was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had still went ahead to buy one at fred meyer for on sale if i did not like it i will return it i reasoned i bought the black colored piece costco and radioshack had it on sale for the same price but fred meyer is closer to my home since adding this piece to our family room the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming warmer richer and entertaining than before i will address the concerns of a few reviews here 1. hissing sound i found none but discovered that if the audio out on your tv has one jacket like mine instead of two or three jackets then you need to get an extension rca jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three out jackets with the apporpriate color codes white red for two jackets and yellow for the third jacket to match the audio in jacket white and red of the dvd player otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your tv audio out to match the color codes on your philips dvd audio in otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound 2. dvd player jumping disc you are using a defective disc solution change your disc 3. back speakers not working they will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode movie stereo etc sometimes some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect so change the tv channel or your dvd disc 4. speaker wires not long enough some consumers had enough length mine were too short for our large family room too large for me to bother to measure one reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation i could not so i returned the banana plugs i bought from home depot instead i bought some digital extension cables they come in different sizes etc the smaller the size number the thicker the cable the better to avoid loss of digital signals i bought size the risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to since it will be considered tampered with but be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set you decide to use additional extension cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable the extension run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the dvd to tape over all exposed with nonconductive electric tape normally comes in black caution you need to buy enough length of extension cable though they come in and length having a large room i bought three 50 feet cables to do the job cost for each 50 ft cable was 5. wall mountings the enclosed wall mountings are fixed you can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted for less than at i bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that i can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle speaking of the sound production it is clear crisp and true theater realism the sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your your self a favor and buy one but for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables i would have given it 5 stars philips should make the plugs universally adaptable so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables if they needed to better still philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables
i was blown away by the sound quality good system at a reasonable price i would recommend this system to all my friend
i had read some other reviews stating that this home theater system makes a buzzing noise however i had my doubts so i ordered it anyway and it 's great no buzzing noise on mine at all i have an apartment and did n't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that i could n't really use anyway because of noise restrictions this system is nice and clear and gives me the home theater experience i was looking for they give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall granted the speaker wire is n't all that thick and has a proprietary connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain it still sounds great and for under 200 bucks why would you care anyway
a very good player at a very reasonable price
this is prob the best item boughten this ! ! ! totaly awsome system tv radio surround all in ! great buy
costco here too 180 was a great price but the hissing has become annoying it does sound like a larger capacitor constant constant i hear it walking through the room passing within feet of the unit the noise dissapears when tray is open only i really like it but the hiss is getting to me i notice its on sale here for 129 maybe ill shop around spend a bit more
this is the ipod i 've ever had and i 've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago for gym work commuting planes no real problems so far the size is excellent the look is sheek and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than i was told it was going to be battery life is not too bad i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red i am dissapointed by the 500 songs is really nothing for people who 've been buying cds for years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions i was also dissapointed that you ca n't do anything with playlists on the ipod basically everything eg creation of playlists deletion of songs moving around of songs has to be done on the computer uploaded to the ipod recommended for and frequent travelers
excellent player by apple thin and very easy to use buttons i bought it for my son and he loves it the itunes software allows you to copy the cd into your library the moment you load it however i found it difficult to copy songs into ipod from cd the software is very confusing you have to first load the songs into library and then into ipod there is no direct way sometimes the software would hang when synching songs also i could not figure out how to easily load pictures on ipod it would be a great product if apple can add fm radio in it with a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back it is a obvious choice over other player
great battery life easy to use all around good the only minus is the dependency on itunes
i bought this as a gift and the person loved it great deal for the money
it 's conviently small but not too small to lose in a purse backpack etc but it has horrible battery life i 'm in college and listen to it while walking between classes or in the gym and i have to recharge just about every other day other than that it 's great just be prepared to have to recharge it all the time
overall very enjoyable sleek design and easy to use wish i had waited for next generation release a month or so after purchase to get lower price during transition could get a few more things included for the cost but the value is good
this ipod was great while i could use it then my wife took it and now i only see it when she needs me to recharge it ! ! i guess it is safe to say that she likes it too ! !
very happy with the nano it was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly she struggled a little with the volume being to low which was disappointing till i played with the settings a little i am a tech specialist so it 's second nature to tinker and found that there was a second master volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when raised that and happy listening ! good buy good product good amazon !
this is a tv card i used to replace my aged lifeview card so i could trinidad tobago games from tv during the world cup in june the tv quality is the best i ever seen from a tv card to date give that it is an ati based card this is really good stuff unfortunately the software package has let me down the card came bundled with cyberlink powercinema in day to day usage of my computer i like to have the fm radio function on with the old card and party fm radio software there was no issues at all with this new card i often ca n't even load a webpage without the music sticking and stuttering this on a computer with ram and 2 hard drives ! i definitely blame the software for this if the sticking becomes too much then the radio stops altogether i 'm forced to close and power cinema to listen to radio again tv is at least stable while doing other stuff but you ca n't shrink powercinema down to a window also there is a 2 second lag between tv and computer watching the same tv station this never occured with the old card intervideo 's windvr used with this card had no such issue it 's a pity i do n't have xp media center edition xp pro i have to compare xp 's media center software with somehow i think media center will perform better windvr works better too barring that the software currently has no sound support for the card powercinema works but it 's not very intuitive the software is written for the novice user with no advanced options at all when recording you do not know exactly what quality you 're using outside of good '' better '' or best '' you ca n't even change the default recording folder ! i am sure that this occurs with other brands of theatre 550 pro cards not just msi 's version as a side note the remote that comes with the card works well in conclusion it 's a card worth getting if you can deal with powercinema 's issues or find a better program to use with the card
just finished burning through my first box of these and they are terrific not one was a dud i always trust all khypermedia blank disks cause i have never had a problem with them do n't hesitate to buy yourself a box of these to use for your own project because they will last you forever great bargain for a great produc
i own many lexar memory cards and am very satisfied with their performance however i must add that lexar usa provides excellent service i live in cape town south africa whilst i was formatting one of my lexar cards in my nikon i terminated the formatting halfway accidentally card was damaged sent card to lexar usa after logging the problem in their website and within 10 days i had a brand new card couried to me by lexar no questions asked this is outstanding service ! ! ! well done lexar expectations
fast times are a must for me i am pleased so far with the card
awesome product fast data collection and holds about 450 photos i would purchase again
lexar compact flash cards have a good reputation amongst many digital photography professionals the wa '' feature provides added value to distance this card from the competition excellent return on investment ! a must buy '' o
when i bought my camera the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package it was very quick far faster than any of the cards i had on hand even those that were of the previous generation of professional '' lexar cards my camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card to the point that i can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly my only complaint is in the card 's reliability after about a month of use about 1000 photos taken the card ceased functioning while within the camera neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers including the pc card slot on my laptop with a cf adapter the image rescue '' software provided by lexar on the card was of no use either lexar replaced the card which has worked fine ever since however i purchased a second one which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken again the included imagerescue software failed to help it found errors but could not do anything about them but a commercial image recovery tool i purchased was able to read then reformat the card and it has worked reliably since
this cf card is so fast that i can run my shutter on my camera non stop until the card is full at a frame rate of 3.5 fps no lag or slow down that is amazing it makes my camera perform better canon rebel xt
i purchased the lexar pro cf card for use with my canon eos digital rebel xt 8 mega pixel dslr camera i also have a sandisk cf card which i also use with the dslr of the two cards the lexar is far and away the fastest in recording reading i can take multiple shots at the camera 's highest resolution 8 mega pixels yet never have to wait for the shots to be saved before shooting more there are also no compatibility problems to be fair to the sandisk it 's an older model i purchased a few years ago for a player however i now use it only as a backup to the lexar i plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future
i just purchased the canon and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities plenty of picture room and i plan to purchase a prior to my trip to ireland price wise i did great and the turnaround time was excellent this card was ranked no 1 in two seperate on line test so i was very sold prior to my purchase
if you find that they ups is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up there 's something wrong with your configuration the ups is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer bios to restart the computer this happens only after the ups has sent a shutdown signal to the computer you should not power on the computer until the ups is done with its power up procedure if you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after ac power is back you should set your computer bios to power on when ac power is restored since while the computer is off it does n't know when the power comes back on when the ups cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on
i installed this unit on my hp amd 64 with a lcd monitor installation was very straightforward with no problems experienced the unit has two rows of power outlets eight outlets total all are surge protected but only one row has battery backup each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets the unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line and interacts well transparently my dsl service the unit comes with a usb connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer also included is powerchute personal edition '' software this software replaces the ups option used under the power '' icon of widow 's xp control panel powerchute pe allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user 's needs powerchute pe automatically loads at computer startup and resides as an icon on the of the window 's task bar it monitors the unit 's status and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference in order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly i only attached the pc and monitor to the powered row of outlets transformers seem to use a lot of power and to gain the most time available for adequate times they should only be plugged into the surge only '' outlet row when power fails the unit immediately picks up the power load it will then begin to shut down the pc if power does not become available shortly the default method it uses is to place the pc into hibernation mode '' saving the desktop exactly as is '' for future it accomplished this task with my pc perfectly if i had wanted a ups to keep my computer running for several minutes during an power outage this is not the unit i would have purchased however to keep my system from due to the power being interrupted momentarily or to shut down the pc safely should the power outage last longer this is a solution for those tasks
the manufacturer only lists software compatibility with os 9. guess what mac os x works great with 10.3 has built in support just plug it in to a usb port and it 's available in the system preferences pane under energy saver from there you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit this is definitely recommended for smaller or people needing short run time i 'm using it with a powerbook so that i can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers you might want to consider the backups office 650 model instead you get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets 8 total instead of 6 total on this unit
i bought 5 of these for the computers in the house i would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all i need is about 30 seconds of power i noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on to my understanding this unit detects dirty power and when it detects it it will then stop accepting ac power i think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up
i have had this for about 2 years and i travel about 100 days a year by car i have it hooked up to my laptop which is on the passanger seat it has never left me down in fact i would be lost without it literly i tracks where i go anywhere in the us with the existing software nothing else to buy ! ! ! it pinpoints where i am at anytime it 's great if you travel a lot like me via car and have a laptop a very good and logical purchase
i have an earlier version of this program and the antenna it works well in the car with my laptop i did not have the trouble others had with service i ordered their latest version of their topo map program it was scheduled to be shipped in late march 2001. i had an immediate need for the program and called them i talked to a real person who directed me to the right people to write to i asked for a beta version to use until the new version was released in less than a week i received the full version not the beta version you ca n't get better service every one of their products has worked well for me and have installed easily
fast and worth the mone
perhaps the ultimate addition to a good camera i used my camera with a sandisk pro duo the blue one and while most times it was fine when i needed to take pictures in quick succession it let me down the ultra ii is noticably faster you will not regret buying this
ultra ii gives very good speed to make sure your camera is n't waiting on memory
i 've had this product for over a year and use it with my nikon it has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments example blowing beach sand salt water mists and in high heat and bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her canon would buy this brand again
i used it in brasil and had it developed i was very happy with it it was the very first time i 've used a digital camera
the sandisk 512 mb secure digitial ultra ii sent to me was not the item i ordered i returned the item unopened
it 's the fastest and most realiable sd card i ever used i heard sandisk has released a newer one that 's even faster but this one is all i need i bought two cards to be used with a digital camera nikon and never lost anything
i can only say positive things about this memory card it does a fabulous job for my 7.1 digital camera anyone who is in the market for a fast memory card with lots of storage this is the one i recommend
i have several sandisk products usb compact flash and sd have been purchasing thier flash cards since the early days cards have allways found them to work great and a good value dollar cost for the quality the new ultra ii sd card is my second sd also have a card also sandisk not ultra however these cards work well and keep on going like the duracell bunny ! there are a lot of cheaper cards but not many that compare in performance and quality
there 's a review here where someone takes their computer and analyzes the performance of the card unfortunately most of the time what matters is how the card works with your camera a camera generally does n't move data as fast as a computer and it has to process it first so those tests really only measure how fast you can download the images or other files to your hard drive if that matters to you great for the rest of you especially camera users here 's the real story you need a faster than standard card if you plan to use video it 's also a good idea with high resolution cameras if they are especially fast at processing and writing the images but i just bought a different sd card for 10 after rebate it 's hard to beat that price performance ratio if you 're just storing photographs sure video of the 2 year old nephews is fun a couple times a year but other than that regular speed cards work fine for many uses always buy what 's right for your needs and if the price differences are small go with the faster card there are promotions every week on various memory cards look for one if you have time those can make higher speed cards a good value though the standard speed cards have gotten so inexpensive you may want one as a backup as well
this is an excellent cd burner i have purchased so many and all of them are great i have no complaints and i feel that this product is of the best quality long lasting and very durable when i build computers for my customers i always purchase this burner
this is my first dvd burner and the first time i used one of amazons merchants i had some concerns about ordering but everything went very smoothly its a good way of purchasing a bargain and i 'm very happy with the sony dvd burner
this dvd burner has exceeded my expectations additionally the price was right including a rebate offer with my effective price lower than some brands
amazon service was fast drive installed easily and is working well after 3 weeks
the drive works great it was a bit difficult to install in my sony computer as the two faceplates that came with the unit were different than the ones on my computer case seems like sony could pay attention to a bit more standardization on such simple things service from amazon was great as expected
this product was perfect it 's a sturdy case that holds my large collection of cd 's and dvd 's my other cases were flimsy and wore out fast this one has a hard outside shell and the inside holds my dvd 's nicely so i have no complaints and at the price i paid i 'd say this was a great deal
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it

definitely recommend this memory card download time is great
this card is lightning fast i am using it with my canon and works great only drawback is that it is slightly expensive but quality never comes cheap
i recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through amazon it did not have the notch at the bottom as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake so i phoned sandisk and was informed based on the serial number that the card is authentic so apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern
i am happy to have several sandisk products and all of them are excellent
the sandisk is absoultely worth the extra money if you love to take many pictures without worrying about how many pictures are left for you to take it is great to use with if your camera has this feature
this memory card is great great quality and allows my 6 mp camera to take tons of pictures i highly recommend this product
it 's a memory card and it works ! i have never had a problem with any memory card i have owned including this one i was told sandisk was a good brand and so far memory card of theirs i have owned they have all been reliable
this card allows me to store 330 pictures at the highest resolution and the lowest compression if you want less resolution more compression you can store over pictures on this one card the other big advantage is the very fast transfer times to and from my pc
works well especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use i have my nes and snes both of which have huge ac adapters plugged into this it saves tons of space on my power strip the design is a little clumsy though so it 's only getting
this is a very practical way to use the lost '' spot on outlets by the transformers that will use at least 2 spaces with this you can even add 2 in one contruction is good and again is practical
i was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic but when i received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely it does come with book page holders but i do n't really use them
so i was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality so i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11 and it works i used it for two weeks now and i am pretty satisfied just like there is one more review on this item and it says that it is strong and i agree it is a great item for the money vitalijus stony
it worked much better than expected the page clips also were very good but one fell off about 5 minutes into the item i put it back on but fell off a couple more times i also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well
i have tried a dozen holders this is the best available others tip over easily or they hold only books of a limited size or they are large heavy bulky and therefore absurdly expensive etc this is light yet sturdy hint i included a few large metal clips the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place with the clips this bookholder works excellently well in addition it is also preforated to fit into any binder the manufacturer thought of everything on this one i keep one in the car for when i read in restaurants another at home and still a third on my office desk
because i 'm a free lance writer and reviewer i often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when i 'm direct quoting i had a book holder from another company but it was a piece of junk it would n't hold up thicker books and the thin rounded holders '' at the bottom kept popping off i even had my husband tried to fix them by shoring up the holders with tape and such it kept breaking and out of frustration i went to an office supply store to look for another one the silver fellowes book holder was all they had although the clerk assured me it was a sturdy i was skeptical i had him go into the office get me a thick hardcover book and proceeded to take the book holder out of the box to test it yes right there in the store ! i was immediately impressed with the sturdiness and snugness of the wide holders at the bottom the plastic looks flimsy but i 'm tellin ' ya this baby really does well for holding open thick books ! i 've been using mine for about a week now and love it no more headaches when i need to get a quote ! yay
i read a lot and i was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page i also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page well i finally decide to try this nice little invention and let me tell you it 's definitely worth it ! it 's cheap but the plastic works fine and does the job well it stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised the stand is adjustable it 's great it makes my life so much easier and i 'm sure glad i bought it
sometimes i need to have a few books open at the same time and still have clear desk space for note taking i used to keep one in my lap or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so i could open another not any more ! now i look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron i was what the crud was i thinking anyway this thing keeps my books open and saves space on my desk the little page holders fall out but not all the time so who cares you 're not going to loose them unless you 've got a silver shag rug that 's three inches deep and it 's not a big deal to pop them back in in truth i have two of these pretty good book things
this stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs it hold the pages open to their correct spots although the page holders come out of their holders the page holders are easy to put back in it saves space on your desk i am a medical student and i have a notebook to write down important information from books i am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks it is a great device considering bookstands are difficult to find
first of all here are my computer specs pentium 4 2.8 fsb 1 gb ram 2 sata 7200 rpm hard drives 80 gb boot drive 250 gb movie drive graphics card ati radeon pcie sound card soundblaster live vcr sony my dvd xpress model number rev 2 my purpose to archive old tapes to dvd installation of the was a quick and painless process within minutes i was already capturing my very first video this unit works very nicely with retail vhs tapes i found that it does not respond to macrovision though i only tested one tape home movies and master tapes tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts at first i captured a short promotional music video at 8 in a resolution of this produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape there are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen then i captured a longer home movie which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a dvd my original bitrate of 8 was too high and the higher bitrate was n't really helping the video quality too much but if my bitrate is too low the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a tv perform a google search for videohelp bitrate calculator '' and click on the videohelp bitrate calculator link i use the calculator to figure out what bitrate i should capture in according to the total time of all the programs i want to put on dvd below 7 seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback but it 's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies after capturing this longer movie i found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot now whenever i operate it i point a small fan at it and this seems to keep it cool and running well but keeping the unit cool should n't be the user 's responsibility so it loses points for temperature while this device works well if the input video has a stable picture a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss being copied several times i tried capturing one of these tapes which was of a tv show from 1993 and the dvd xpress did not handle it very well the result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory i am disappointed with this on the other hand i have a tape that was recorded from tv in 1988. it is the master copy so there is no generational loss dvd xpress was able to capture it just fine not once during any of my captures did audio video get out of sync so credit where credit 's due to ads tech for that after a few days of experimenting with this capture device i definitely want to keep it i look forward to finally being able to clean out my vhs closet my recommendations to other buyers understand your source and you wo n't be disappointed there is no way you can make your year old tapes look pristine again but if the video signal is strong and stable the dvd xpress should be able to capture it with no problems
i 'm a little surprised at the average low rating this product has received from other users currently i 'm running an with ram the software installed easily the first time with no problems and in no time i was recording my first transfer from a vhs player i 'm very comfortable using adobe premiere elements 2.0 so that 's what i decided to use instead of the bundled software i 've created over 25 dvd 's successfully and tonight i decided to give the direct to disk '' a try i recorded directly from the video source to the dvd and just like that i had a single session recording that looked beautiful during playback on my dvd player i have nothing but praise for the ease of use and dependability of version i have used other hardware packages on lesser systems and yes there were many problems but after upgrading to something with more power like the with ram well it was a whole new ballgame everything worked as advertised just as it should
if you do n't want to spend a ton of money and you want the best quality possible i am using the ads tech dvd express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my directv dvr onto dvd the quality is outstanding 2 quick complaints but really these are only minor things 1 setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it was n't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure the message should have said '' make sure the usb cable is plugged in directly to your mother board '' other words in the back of your computer and with a usb port that came with your computer instead of an add on easy enough fix but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple 2 on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video this has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100 pure video with no errors this is a great product n't look any where else
the dvd express 2.0 worked the first time i tried it it always helps to have a little knowledge of computers as most who have written reviews probably have i agree that ulead really sucks and they could have bundled better software witht he unit if you are having trouble getting this little baby going i would suggest a computer class would be apropriate
this flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months i used viking 's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response they offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed they gave me an rma to ship it back for a replacement i had a new one within a week no hassle no fees other than the 1.50 to mail it back to them i never expected such great customer service the new drive is working fine so hopefully that was just a bad batch
this usb flash memory drive works exactly as described and i 'm glad i bought it i did n't give it 5 stars because its size makes it a little inconvenient to use my laptop has two usb ports one directly under the other this device is big enough that it prevents connecting a second usb device to the other port at the same time i 've given up on the rebate it 's been nearly 5 months and have not helped
the usb flash frive is super easy to use and and it so small to cary anywhere i use it for presentations and to load other computers that i 'm working with i would recommend it for not only the great price but the size and value
it works sweet it saves my from dragging around my laptop
nice simple design easy to use worked great for me so far
it works great ! i really like it there is one small problem though the lid is really hard to take off ! i 've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little but not much there has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on but is n't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it i appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion
i had two unworking disks one a game and the other a psx game so i picked this up and both work fine now ! the only thing is you 'll have to run it through a couple times if you run it through once you 'll see little difference but for the price and since it does work eventually i still give it a 5 out of 5
i have this unit and it works great to clean dirty dvds like those bought used from blockbuster or hollywood video often are however it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks i did get one of two 'unplayable ' dvds to work after using the repair function of this unit i 'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large dvd rental store to see if they can repair it if they cant with their machine it is probably a my main complaint is that i ca n't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid i hate to have to pay 8 for stuff i do n't need my collection is now at over 1800 different dvds so i have some experience with cleaning them
i had a dvd that was scratched during shipping one repair kit did nothing to help it i considered using the skip but i never cared for what it did to the disks my church 's media center uses the optifix system so i decided to try it too the scratch was gone and the dvd plays with no problem whatsoever i 'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way some scratches can not be repaired at all i just know that it worked great for me
i 'd had quite a few previously viwed dvds that had scratches as a result my dvd player would freeze this product fixed a couple of dvds for me as far as the haze you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of optrix afterwards i stopped buying dvds new unless i can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin
this card is the 2 gb ultimate it has a tested write speed 120 times which exceeds 18 mb per second frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed which is always much faster analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second that impacts time between pictures for cameras write speed is the most important but the speed rating of the card does n't necessarily tell you its write speed for music players and other devices read speed may be more important so you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures i 'm currently shopping for sd cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes in order not to slow the camera down i need a fast card i have done some research and realized that the reviews here are n't necessarily even related to this particular card but are for all different sizes and speeds of kingston cards kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings this card is 1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
this one was purchased for my pocket pc have been storing files pictures and more important my recordings clearly it 's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam i got it at a really good price !
this is a great buy because i have a lot of space i use the card on my digital camera and i take a lot of pictures without download to the computer i can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until back home it 's a great card at a very good price
i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again
the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent
i 'm afraid i do n't know a lot about this technology i went for economy and i am getting very good quality photos i think i would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and i really do n't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow its still faster than my old one so i 'm generally happy hope this is some hel
i bought this memory card for my camera at first i was very dispointed when i only see on my laptop after googled around i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over i 'm able to see full after driver update just make sure you update your first
it looks stupid on the picture but wen u get it it looks awesome that light color is becuz its a little curvy it looks awesome and plays grea
nice package for the beginning guitarist everything you need to start playing right out of the box guitar is well made and has a nice sound only problem was i had to change the strings as they were tarnished and would not hold their tune good value for the mone
it is a compact flash and it does exactly that so i am happy with it
i use this little device with my apple powerbook to transfer photos taken with canon digital cameras mac os x recognizes the unit with no additional drivers required and it works great much more convenient than attaching the camera itself to the computer every time
i bought this becuase downloading pictures from my digital rebel xt camera took forever and a day to complete using this drive only took about a minute to download 2 gigs of pictures ! you do n't need the cd if you have windows xp
works well with or without software installed good for home use and school or traveling
i have a card reader slot in my computer but i purchased this to keep in my camera bag just in case i want to download to a computer that does n't it works great but my only complaint is that it 's a little bulky other than that it 's a great card reader
this sandisk cf type imagemate usb 2.0 is a neat little device i just pull the compact flash card out of my camera stick it in the imagemate plug the usb cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a transfer or worry about draining the camera 's battery i 'm running xp and did n't need to install a thing i just plugged it into the usb port and xp found and recognized it the only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that i wish it plugged directly into the usb port itself like the simple tech bonzai usb 2.0 card reader though that uses cards instead of cf instead of having to use the separate included usb cable
i spent 10 on a mediagrear keychain cf card reader first that reader is usable but it is hard to pull my cf card out i think that reader 's pins are very likely to damage my cf cards if i insert and pull my cards very frequently then i decide to get this reader with 20 at bestbuy not a very good price and i am very satisfied with the product when you insert your card into the reader it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader just half of the card is inside the reader so i do n't need to pull it very hard when i want to get the card out it comes out smoothly and i no longer worry about damaging my card when i plug the reader into my computer it works immediately no need to install any driver if you do n't need to use that transfer button
from appearances and description this appears to be identical to my no except for the shape of the button this sandisk is an excellent unit compact and reasonably slim with a detachable usb cord it is perfect for carrying in a pocket of your laptop case unlike my dazzle which is fine for a desk top but awkwardly shaped for compact storage the unit is reliable and fast and unlike the or units which use up four letters this unit only uses one letter it supports reading writing deleting and works with either usb 2.0 or usb if you do not care about the button software this unit installs without needing a driver cd at least on win 2000 and xp it simply appears as a removable letter in explorer i did not install the button software because i am not a fan having extra transfer mechanisms and photo organizers on my computer i would rather be in full manual control of how and when things happen and where files are put i think that this is a unit but i downgrade my own unit to 4 stars because of its overzealous packaging and arrogant installation instructions in both the instructions and on a sticky label on the unit which i still have not been able to fully remove it proclaims that you must install the button software before connecting the unit i ignored that warning and the unit worked fine without any installation needed one of the important requirements in a card reader is portability since not everyone takes kindly to your installing software on their computer the card must be able to work just by plugging it into the usb port the sandisk meets this requirement although it proclaims not to this is a good choice for a compactflash
this controller is absolutely phenomenal not only is it wireless but it corrects my only gripe about the microsoft i 'm '' and have fairly large hands i love the layout of the but the arms '' are too short for my hands this leads to pretty nasty cramps in my pinky fingers during long sessions and ends runs in forza and call of duty long before i 'm ready to quit the logitech controller 's arms ca n't honestly be more than a longer than the 's but it makes a world of difference i highly recommend this controller not only for it 's fantastic wireless performance but for actually being comfortable than the another reviewer posted a gripe in regards to the lack of a slot and it 's a valid complaint i found the perfect solution in the logitech wireless headset which can be had here for 20 it works great and it should be noted that microsoft still wants 30 for the standard wired headset which comes with an clip for the boom mic all in all this controller is absolutely the best one you can find for the xbox pair it up with the wireless headset from logitech and you have a completely wireless setup for 50 a pop you honestly ca n't do better for any amount of money
i bought this controller at walmat for around 32.00 worth the money no lag whatsoever buy this controller le
the controller is exactly like the microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to 30 feet away from the and not having a cord in the way the controller works perfect
wireless is the way to go ! when i put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place singular and clean looking this sweet little controller is imo another triumph by logitech ! though a little smaller than the it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance i got mine used and once again put old batteries in it takes 2 even four months later i am just now getting the low battery light flashing still vibrates still responds acurately and the analog sensitivity is better than the wired get it get it get it ! !
i love this controller i have small hands for an adult and the pad fits me well i like the shape better than even the controller s shape i have no problems with delay or drift i have n't used the but the thumbsticks and buttons work great though i 'm not a terribly heavy user this pad works better than either the pelican eclipse or soul that i own my madcatz lynx is better but way too big for my hands i like the feel of the plastic the only thing i would change would be making the thumbsticks a bit shorter and concave on top though i 've never had a problem with grip
i bought this card to go with my canon and have not been let down i can get about 500 jpegs and 300 raw sandisk makes highly constant products i can set the to take high speed continuos shooting and take 5 raw pic 's and not have the card slow down my camera very happy with it
i received this item for use in a new digital slr camera it is fast and stores excellent pictures
this card is fast and is the right price it holds tons of high res jpegs and around 200 raw images on my rebel xti highly recommended
bought this card along with a rebel xt as a gift for my girlfriend it 's been performing without a hitch so far though on burst mode there is transfer lag in that the pictures take a lot faster than can be transferred to the card and so after the burst the pictures are still being written to memory
i have an eos digital rebel and was looking for a memory upgrade at first i thought to buy a sandisk memory but due to the price fall of memory cards i decided to buy the card instead when i inserted the card into the camera it recognized the card right away reporting a whopping 575 photos in format or 262 in raw format that 's more than i need even for a one week vacation trip but if i upgrade my camera on christmas it may come just right for storage i may not be very technical about this but the read and write speed was noticeable faster than my previous two year old memory card about twice as fast either for browsing or saving pictures i have always trusted in sandisk products and this card is no exception quality and performance is as good as i expected
i have been using cf card now for a while in my nikon i have been very pleased with its response time in multi shot mode it keeps up with the camera and i never have to wait highly recommended
hard to be verbose about a cf card but it has performed without a hitch in my rebel xt used a ultra ii when i bought the camera a year ago picked up the card before a family vacation in august excellent product no worries
i have had nothing but good experiences with sandisk products this ultra ii card keeps up with my new nikon without any problems it 's speed is also a plus when transferring the files to my pc
arrived on time and in excellant condition it works very well my laptop is much more comfortable to use
i like it it moves the air out the back pretty fast keeps my legs from melting with my hp shooting all the air down now i can actually work in longer stretches because i do n't have to take time to air out my lap
really like the chill pad keeps my laptop cool ! ! does its job and i would recomend it to anyone lizz
i have an older laptop that really gets hot when holding it on my lap bought the chill pad and was surprise how the two little fans work in keeping the heat factor down it would be worth 5 stars if it was adjustable
this technically works well i am finding learning to use it difficult i really wish i had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one ! ! ! ! ! it is a lot smaller than i thought it would be and would be alot easier if it was bigger
i love this tablet it 's just like working with the real thing with out all that mess just got to get used to it i never thought i woulde use the modern art tech but i gave it a chance and i love it
i love this tablet ! i get the functionality of a tablet computer on my little thin sony i almost bought a tablet notebook but it was so heavy i have the best of both worlds now !
what an amazing product for such a small price it works right out of the box but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers the option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday pc work as well using the pen for graphics i use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures it really makes a difference the unit seems well made and i like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice i opted for the smallest in the range for value and was not disappointed but i am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better but at cost the software bundle is ok too if you do n't already have photoshop tools the one quibble is that at home when i installed the drivers it continued to crash my pc with my wireless keyboard installed not ideal but as i dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me but be careful i am sure there will be a fix somewher
before purchasing this wacom i did a lot of research and decided it was probably worth a few extra bucks to get one with a good reputation i have no complaints i ca n't complain about the size because i knew what 4 '' x 5 '' amounted to before i bought it the clicker on the pen takes a little getting used to but what does n't like the title says it 's just what i was hoping for
this is a wonderful item i upgraded my tablet and it is amazing ! i had fast shipment product was in great shape and i love it thanks !
if you do a lot of photo retouching the will give you a lot more control than a mouse the pressure sensitivity is very helpful when you are masking the lighter you press the less dense the mask is it allows you to paint '' in the the absolute mode location of the pointer on the screen is based on exactly where you the pen of the pen takes a little while to get used to and i still seem to have a little trouble with it after switching from the mouse but after a minute or so of using it it comes pretty easily i think it might be a real pain on a larger tablet it 's fun to use too
i was considering purchasing a tablet and wacom was consistantly recommended i was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because i didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line the intuos line i was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong installing a driver was a piece of cake and i began drawing away in minutes it is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs paintshop pro painter photoshop the mouse is pretty useless however and i would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead they seem to wear out though i do press pretty hard other than that its an amazing product

this adaptor is great especially for the price installation was as easy as it gets right out of the box i had it up and running through a local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes it locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection both frontpage and cliemail ran fine speed is maybe 80 of what i get on my laptop running a 333 mhz celeron and a pc card adaptor just be sure your pda is on the small list of supported devices negatives it 's not the sturdiest looking thing in the world i would n't leave it in the clie when not in use and i sure would n't want to drop it on the floor it does chew through the battery but not any more than the backlight i did a test with my with the backlight set at minimum ie not off entirely and using cliepet 's underclock app to slow it down to 96 mhz this is a good combination of power saving and usability then i got on the net and loaded pages starting from a fully charged battery it ran 55 minutes before the first alarm i was able to get another 20 minutes of intermittent use out of it after that i consider that perfectly acceptable with an extended battery you should easily be able to get 2 to 3 hours of use out of it overall a great for a fraction of the price of a
i got this card last month and i 've been using it heavily its been great its sturdy and can has great range there are a few problems though 1 there is no case for the card 2 the included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible luckily i had netfront 3.1 3 memory stick lan software will occasionally error but a soft reset will fix it otherwise its a great little expansion card
this item gives wireless capability to clie users and it 's the only option if you dont have a wireless integrated handheld it is compatible with the models and the wlan card works great and i recomend this for every clie user who wants to go wireless
i bought this for my digital camera because my other batteries did n't last very long these work great and last for a long time
it tells you what it is doing some communication is better than none
voltage input can be either or which is very important in other countries nickel metal hydride batteries are better than old fashioned rechargables because they do not necessarily have to be totally discharged before recharging charging units are compact and light
gives me charged cells in quick advantage is the world wide voltage capabilit
i bought this to replace original canon batteries that came with my canon this is really good and i am happy with battery life charge time etc the best features i like short charge time compact cas
we recharge batteries all the time with this charger and it does an excellent job all the time
this worldwide charger is the best that i have ever used i use this mainly for my camera nowadays i do n't even bother to charge frequently but a small drawback would be then can have provide aaa batteries as well in there pack so that we do not buy them individually
great batteries for cameras they charge quickly and it 's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time just in case ''
the charger arrived with in 2 amazon prime i used this battery for my canon a 530 and it works like a charm

i purchased the elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i do n't have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of and sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future

we had purchased a dvd recorder and within months of continued use we noticed the picture quality was very poor i contacted the place that we had bought it and they suggested we invest in a lens cleaner as we had used the unit heavily over the last months we bought this product and from the time of cleaning it has worked perfectly i will recommend anyone having problems with their dvd to try this first before sending the unit to the repair shop as i was about to do
ca n't see spending tons of money to clean a product that has been out in the market for lots of years it works just fine and cleans just as stated
i got it at very reasonable price approx 4 bucks sells for at retail stores works great and nothing can beat this deal ! ! ! ! only if its free ! ! ha ! ha
it is inexpensive and works my daughters cd maching kept getting error messages popped this in cleand the lens and no longer get error messages what more can you say
i have a sony dvd player from about 4 years ago that was top of the line at the time and would still be good today if functioning recently however it was seriously malfunctioning i would put a dvd in and it would keep spinning but then not recognize it at all it would recognize and play cds but they would skip constantly i decided to give this a chance for 5 to see if i could recover my player i ran it once and it seemed to skip less but would still not recognize dvds i thought maybe if i put it in repeat and run it a few times it might work voila ! ! ! i could n't believe it dvds were recognized and played again so give it a try maybe run it a few times ! ! !
hi hey do n't run to the repair shop just yet and do n't kick that to the curb too soon is on the way ! ! ! my dvr was giving me grief not reading or writing to discs properly until i fed it this memorex laser lens cleaner wow it worked like magic ! ! ! it 's been nearly 3 weeks already and not a single error message and it plays and records like the day i purchased it if you own a a memorex laser lens cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop it certainly did in my case ! ! ! just my two cents
i like the use of this product i think it did solve solve the problem my computer drive was facing which was slow reading the cds with the low price its a must for every computer owner to use this
i do n't have much room on my desk but this copy holder fits perfectly and is still sturdy enough to hold up most texts
this is working out real well as a notebook stand for me you ca n't beat the pric
this product is retty good but do n't even try putting a bood on it the holder will tip over and it does n't clip the pages of a book very well but for papers it 's good and it 's adjustable which is convient it did hold my notebook very well but for books it sucks
this holder keeps papers upright and in position but it does n't handle books particularly well as the clip can not grip surfaces as thick as most books and the base is n't as wide as most books when they 're opened i have this and a book stand so i keep myself covered on both ends
i love my tooldial and its ' software my only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively i frequently find that it gums up photoshop and a little overall great product and i expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs works very well in tandem with a wacom tablet
been waiting for the windows version since i saw the product at pma on mac earlier this year used the windows version from the very moment it was available i touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end adjusting brush size is the best bracket keys never cut it for me i think the product does more but just taking advantage of those two items is a huge timesaver and a stress saver if you do touch up work in photoshop all day long this is a must have
the nulooq is an inexpensive and really fun way to fly through images in photoshop when cloning out specks or needing to move throughout an image with lightning speed the function is tremendous ! it 's a programmable tool where you can add photoshop tools and actions to the tooldial for instant access at the mouse location rather than moving to the menu bar all the time this is a great time saver because you can program in redundant tasks to appear on the tool dial to be clicked in a moments notice changing brush size is as simple as turning the tool tuner to the appropriate brush size in real time i highly recommend it to speed and simplify one 's workflow
i bought a nulooq when it first came out for the mac i 've been an illustrator visualization artist for 17 years now i have an imac at home and a pc at my job it takes a little while to break some old habbits but once you do and get used to the nulooq device you 'll never go back ! i love this smart toy ! i got so hooked on it i recently purchased one for my pc here at work if there is anyone out there that thinks it 's just for the mac your wrong ! the pc version is just as good ! it 's become part of my left hand and i still use my wacom tablet all the time also ! to me this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer cross platform bravo to logitech for making another great product ! get one i 'll guarantee you 'll get hooked on it
logitech scored a big plus with this item the important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly the first review is really unfair logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the nulooq on a processor it says so right on the box i 'm using it on a and i feel that i 'm behind a bit with power to review the nulooq on a is ludicrous of course it wo n't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box hook this thing up to your updated mac and you 'll see it shine my workflow has been streamlined and i enjoy the more tedious tasks more than i ever did good job on this one i recommend it highly
i am a photographer whop purchased this for use in photoshop it exceeded my expectations and continues to amaze me daily i now use it for everything from my safari browser and itunes to games it is truly a flexible and fun product that is easy to use with many applications ! it is by far the most innovative product i have ever used and the tooldial software it comes with is awsome !
i bought the nulooq product a few weeks ago with little expectation and actually with some doubts it 'd do anything for me as i 'm a keyboard junkie the product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot but what a surprise just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price the menu thing is cool i do n't use it as much for putting tools but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place i guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around but i do n't seem to use that as much i still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around hey i was skeptical about the product like anyone else but found myself a rare surprise good job logitech
i 've had this product for well over a year now and was using it with my xp machine and am now using it with my apple mac mini works great with both windows and mac os x with no hassles the removable stand is a nice touch as you can pack the reader into a laptop bag or lay it horizontally if you prefer highly recommended
i bought this card reader in 2004 to use with sd cards since then i have moved over to cf cards sandisk ultra ii 's both 1 and 4 gig and it has worked great every time
i have only used this a couple of times but it has worked well and is fater than downloading pictures from the camera
this is a great card reader for the price why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have personally i only use compactflash and sd cards it reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably the shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards which you 'll want to do a bit carefully it would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the sandisk logo on the card reader it is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first but once you get the feel of it it beccomes quite easy and routine this sandisk has led indicators that are helpful one amber led to tell you the unit is connected to your usb and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert solid green or that it 's reading or writing blinking green this card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and i feel it represents a good value i would recommend it
the reader worked as advertised i 'm very pleased with the
the sandisk reader is impossible to misuse it loads quickly and it 's compact shape offers most options for memory it can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet i would prefer a little more weight so that it does n't move around on my desk so i 'm giving it only 4 stars if i had to replace this reader i would buy another sandisk
no problem reading and burning on nec the media code is mcc which is highly rated in most media guides online albeit not the best i also burn dvds as slow as i can unless i am in a hurry less chance for errors that way
i am very happy with these they are fast and with very good qualit
i agree that these are not top of the line but they are n't bad at all i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for in this case it takes longer but i get good results i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd i would buy these again updated on i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters very happy with this product
i have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters they are burning at in my nec burner that is pretty considering that it is advertised at hopefully the burn quality also will be good and will last for a few years
no problems with this sandisk i can take about 300 pictures from my nikon camera quality is perfect
shipping was outrageous thought it qualified for free shipping since it is the size of a f'n postage stamp but i ended up paying 1 cent less for postage than i did for the item could have bought it at walmart for less this way buyer beware i got took
good price what else can one say about a secure digital card
excellent service from amazon best quality in lowest price i am really very happywith amazo
this is an excellent reliable product i bought 2 because of the outstanding sale price
i love this sd card its not slow its pretty good i got it bundle with a sd card too works great with my gps unit
this card works great and is significantly less expensive than it is at local retail stores as a matter of fact i just ordered another one yesterday
this sandisk digital card has been very useful and worked perfectly fine thank you
the card performs exactly the way that i expected it to and i have had zero issues with speed downloading images from the care to my pc
i was impressed with the quality of pictures i got with this memory card i have a very inexpensive camera but the pictures are terrific
this is a high quality product and can be used in several digital cameras with great results
i gave this to my nephew for his birthday hold lots of pics and videos at least 250 pics i would n't say it ever cost as much as the marked down '' price but was a savings for the same capacity card at the discount retail stores about 15 cheaper i am pleased
bought this item over a year ago and have had no problems with this card it holds lots of pictures depending on your settings and has n't caused me any problems well worth the money ! i take lots of pictures of my son and anytime we go anywhere new so it gets used a lot
how many pictures will it store it is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about well considering i worked in the memory industry for over 7 years i can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as i have since changed industries the kingston secure digital memory card like most cards will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera these numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality jpeg setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera i truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs
sd cards are dropping in price on a daily basis it seems i do n't like to use too large of a capacity since my tragic event at disney took place i had a 256 card and an error happened on my camera which i have since trashed for this incident and bought a new nikon but anyway i had over pics on my card and could only pull off about 40 of disneyworld i cried so as a suggestion clean off your memory cards after each event and do n't go for the or the cards unless you are putting video on it or etc now i am a happy person once again since my hubby 's going to take me back to dw to replenish those missing pics ! SMILE
bought this card for my xda i pda worked fine right out of the box however this only showed up as card ! ! ! not sure if this is the sd card itself or the pda causing the loss of some worth of space also it is slow to write to the card but quite fast when reading from the card
the card works great in my camera what more is there to say
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
i was attracted to this remote by the web programming interface i have friends who have to hold their remotes and program each command one at a time and then build the macros by contrast i was able to configure my system even before i bought the remote there is a trial sw available on the harmony web page which took me 15 minutes to set up once i had a list of my devices once i had the harmony box opened it took me about 4 minutes to start using it to control my tv dvd etc since the web site remembers your setup a couple of commands did not work right away so i ended up having to add them in individually exit '' and ok '' were not correct in the harmony database for my panasonic tv i also noticed that the cradle does not contact well but it 's easy to see when contact is made and it does n't take much to adjust it besides the remote does n't need charging all the time only once a week for moderate usage even my wife loves this remote just having one remote is a joy for her and trust me of the remote is the way to go i 'm only pissed that there is now a 30 rebate like the week after i bought mine
easy to use and fairly easy to set up however as stated in most previous reviews i read initial setup may be a bit more challenging for those not comfortable with computer navigation and use wish that macro creation was more detailed for example more detail on steps to create a customized macro to watch a dvd including ejecting and closing the dvd tray pleased with purchase
best remote product i ever purchased i have the older version of the harmony and this newer version is 10 times better lipo battery last for ever and you dont need to worry about it going dead because you charge it to much
this was a breeze to set up just install the software on you computer enter the model numbers of your components for those few items that are n't in the list the 880 can learn from an old remote as a very nice bonus if you do n't have the old remote the software will try to pick a device example you have an rca tv model xyz if model xyz is n't in the list it might suggest zxy and that suggestion should work i liked how i could create a list of favorite channels and how i could upload icons for those channels to the remote so that it shows the icon instead of the number or better yet open the icon in paint and in the icon put the number the channel number right the icon it looks good and works great ! i love how the database for the ir codes for all the different devices can be added to by the users of the remote i understand that no company could ever hope to have all of the ir codes for all devices ever made to think that a company could do that would be insane logitech realized there is power in numbers let the end users help to improve things it also allows you to leave any components on permanently for example my tivo box i do n't want that to turn off it can be turned off and as a default the harmony 880 will turn it off to save power i prefer it on and making that change was pretty simple you just go into the preferences for the tivo in the harmony software and tell it always leave this device on '' now when you hit the off button on the harmony remote everything else turns off and the harmony 880 leave the tivo on my only complaints are these items the buttons to the left and right of the screen are a little tough to push i personally think they should have been a little easier to activate also i would have liked to have had the pause button a little more centered and more separated from the other buttons that way it would have been easier to pause a tv tape and last but not least the media and device buttons should have been separated more from the left and right arrows that are just above those buttons it 's a little tough to hit them without thinking about what you are doing given to have made the improvements i have just said would require adding a little width to the remote but the trade off would have been for the better all in all i suggest the remote for anyone who has a number of components for their home theater it works wonders it might just be that i am a little to picky on my technology
i was a bit skeptical about this purchase although i previously owned one of the first harmony remotes in days and was very pleased with it some of the reviews were a bit particularly about the 890 with its rf option so i went for the 880 and i am glad i did despite comments from others the programming was superb all my components were already in the database certainly i was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package in any event the process was hassle free and i now have a fully integrated control for my replay tv cable box tv receiver dvd and vcr just as i had hoped for the control process is seamless and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of ir commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great the fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit my only slight critique is that the remote does not have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off however the help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again the rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too i have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base overall i thoroughly recommend the 880
if you have basic pc skills this remote is for you with its usb connection you can basically make any button you want anywhere you want it the small lcd screen is very easy to set up and you if your to lazy to customize your remote me it also has a learning port the learning port is as easy as pointing your old remote at your new one my favorite feature is turning everything on the button play dvd '' turns on the dvd player suround sound and tv additionally it sets the inputs to the proper settings so your dont have to pres the only problem that i have with this remote is the recharge base it sits on it so light that sometimes it gets bumbed and gives off a beep all in all this is probably the best remote ive ever had
i had an ipod for about a year and had a lot of problems with it having to get it replaced twice before my warranty expired after the third time i sold it to a friend and invested in the iaudio instead this is a great product as it can record sound play movies radio and play tons of file formats i highly reccomend this product especially over the ipod they are crap compared to this the only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts files songs from itunes if you purchase music from them as the iaudio ca n't read or it 's easy enough to get a converter just might cost you a little more money outstanding use of my money though up
i bought this player in december 2005 since then this beautiful piece of technology has been working extremely well i have no complaint about it because i 'm extremely dependent of this player so that means that i use it around 5 hours in my days off and 2 hours in a regular example of how durable this player is because i like to exercise running with the music as my main therefore with the really hard to find function in portable hard drives the iaudio is one the most functional pmp on the market about the sound is just incredible clear with the right unique complaint is about the with wmp so i 'm still waiting the right firmware as a conclusion cowon almost has my complete faith in their products
when i started looking for an player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level the ipod was a consideration as was another top rated sony player however i did n't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console i thought i would try something new if you asked ten people who cowon was i would say probably nine of the ten could n't tell you it is very sturdy and has the same general as the ipod clearly designed to compete with apple the iaudio has some very valuable aspects sound quality especially from something that weighs under 8 oz i am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable all metal construction and overall great feel design and intuitive i found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes converts from the ipod may take some getting used to plethera of options bass surround sound pan wallpaper 5 band equalizer fm radio voice recorder surround sound and mp enhance ability to play video 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time powerful i normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it about the same as equal or lesser players easy program to use for transferring any type of file to the iaudio it is a drag and drop system it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music you need is included in the box earphones usb 2.0 transfer cable another cable a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player charger and jetshell software storage space 20 gb which can be used to store much more than there are some negative attributes to the iaudio however most glaring problem i had was with the headphones they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable they also have an assymetrical length cord i consider myself to have average size ear canals so i imagine this is a major problem for other users i suggest cowon completely redesigns these the brand is widely unknown the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews place online to buy particulary for this player however i read somewhere that there would soon be one just like itunes this being my first player i am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price because i would rather pay more for the quality the iaudio is an all around outstanding media player and i believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out if i were to rate everything that came in the box i would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones other than that this player is close to perfect
i like many other people that have written reviews here researched the purchase of an player in great detail other members of my family own ipods and that is the direction that i was heading until i did a massive amount of research if you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on cd this is the unit that you want ipod will not let you download your own songs i did not know that until after i purchased this player thankfully this unit was the highest rated unit by far that i was able to scour the internet for if this is your first purchase of an player like mine buy this one no questions asked do not worry about trying to buy 80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal crisp clear awsome base and i have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40. i can not hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing i received this player in the mail today at when i got home from work and by i have transfered the 114 artists folders about songs that i had ripped on my computer last week about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player i would recomend buying the cradle it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo which i plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool absolutley buy this unit i have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and i have a high performance expectation and it has met it
i am not going to rehash what the other comments have said most that mention pros and cons are accurate here is my addition joystick is not as good as the ipod on the other hand the ipod was designed by apple and therefore needs extra software to use it with a pc i have not even installed any software to use my iaudio ! i use it as a hard drive player and sometimes i record radio shows to listen to later i got the for extra storage the iaudio seems to be quality made and does n't scratch as bad as my son 's ipod i would buy this product if i had to do it all over again !
this is the second keyboard i 've purchased not because the first one broke because it 's such a great keyboard now i keep one at home and take one with me when i go lanning the only issue with the keyboard is the lcd is pretty useless is fast paced fps games otherwise it 's good for keeping the clock up so one does n't lose track of the time
i bought this a few months back and i use it mostly for playing wow pros very high quality product strong enough to endure long combat sessions the lcd is very useful if like me you enjoy playing your own music while you play a game because it allows me to control itunes whithout out of the game macro keys open up a huge array of possibilites and they are particularly helpful if you can arrange your action buttons to duplicate their positioning on your keyboard i use flexbar with wow cons the software needs a bit of improvement if i put my computer to hybernate the software seems to hang when i bring it back up and i ca n't use the macro keys so i have to reboot or kill the software 's process and restart it manually the interface used to configure the macro keys lacks a bit of usability it forces me to use the mouse a lot and i like being able to use the keyboard even though the lcd offers other posibilities like displaying available ammo i do n't use most of them because i can get most of these values from my game 's ui and i dont have to look away from the monitor to do so overall a very good product if you enjoy keyboard based computer gaming would n't go back to a regular keyboard for gaming
overall this keyboard is great here are what i like about it 1. i can fly on this key due to it 's relatively soft keys i think there are softer keyboards less resistance when pressing down god i miss my spar station keyboard but ca n't use it with a pc 2. lcd screen has huge growth potential for other info display 3. lighted keys this can be a bad thing too 4. programmable keys lots of them ! can be a headache to remember them too the flaws 1. the lighted keys uses a bright blue color even at the dimmest setting it 's still not good here 's some physics for the designers the human eye does n't sense blue well in the dark and thus the pupil stays wide open and the blue lights can be seen as a bad glare same effect of having one of those expensive hid xeon headlights beaming at you so why is this a problem on a keyboard well you would most likely use it in the dark with the key lights on however your peripheral vision will have this blinding glare it could make some people dizzy or have some optical illusion that 's not going to sit well with your eye 's scan rate suggestion for the designer use other less intrusive color for the led possibly red orange green hell make them selectable ! blue would not be my first choice 2. the usb plugs on this keyboard does n't support my usb 2.0 flash drive bad ! ! ! ! if you are going to provide an usb port do it right ! 3. the black soft rubber surface on the edge and lcd back cover is a dust magnet they provide some good traction when you grab them but they also grab dust like nothing else so you 'll endup with an impossible to clean black surface lesson learned do n't eat snacks near the keyboard or your keyboard will end up with lots of nice snacks for the dog to lick SMILE ok duck tape would fix that but i 'm lazy ! other than that it 's a solid keyboard
i 've had the logitech for several months now and it has many features which i use regularly the paint does n't seem to wear off even if i rub or scratch at the keys installation was somewhat time consuming because the keyboard has drivers for each part rather than one driver for the entire thing lights look great screen is easily readable third party lcd apps are highly customizable i can use chat on trillian and access my buddy list with the screen keystrokes go directly to the screen when you hit the button for reply then i can send it by hitting enter i can view a winamp visualization and song title view my playlist change various volume controls and use standard playback functions i can view network activity macros are easy to program the key feel is awesome compared to my old keyboard they have a nice solid click to them but the pressure necessary and the keystroke length are both small included lcd apps are terrible and useless to me long setup more than you 'll ever use minimal game support lcd apps take up valuable ram although not much keyboard profiler takes up ram and must run to maintain full functionality invisible lettering when the lights are off light brightness levels are pointless the options are n't see it ! but dim more visible but still dim usb ports are usb 1.1 gaming mode switch '' i never hit the windows key while gaming even though i usually use ctrl and alt frequently i think you 'd really have to be fumbling with the keys to need that feature the wrist rest is flimsy the default lcd setting is to cycle through the apps which i hate and if i do n't shut down properly the lcd profiler resets all its settings to default the included checker does n't have ssl you need to get some ridiculous add on which sucks up more resources the mail checker the ssl thing ends up being a little too resource heavy for me to appreciate in other words its a big pain to get gmail working with the included checker if you play a lot of world of warcraft or really like to tweak your settings and streamline your interface you might enjoy having all the macros the screen is more useful for purposes so do n't buy it with intent to improve your experience since the lcd does n't display anything for anyway there are many party lcd apps out there and you can probably find one that will make you love the screen be warned unless you use the party apps you probably will be disappointed with the lcd 's functionality bottom recently the priced spiked up for these keyboards i would n't pay the new higher price for one this is n't the kind of item i would say that i ca n't live without its mainly a luxury and unless you 're a serious computer geek like myself you probably wo n't even know how to utilize the more advanced features the hardware is solid and powerful if you know how to use it the included software cd ended up in my trash can
this fashionable keyboard does spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared to the typical keyboard the lcd screen is a nice feature toy but i find myself rarely using it as most apps and games do n't support it the two usb ports are very handy and would be especially so for anyone without frontside usb on their towers it is worth buying for anyone in that situation the blue lighting on the keys do make them easier to read in a dim room but does n't help much in a truly dark room the macro keys are plentiful and easy to use well worth the buy for anyone wanting something that looks nicer then the typical keyboard anyone needing easy access to usb ports and for anyone needing macro keys people may also want to give the new vista keyboard from microsoft a look
i 'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i 'm very happy
we bought this tv 3 months ago and do n't regret it one bit it was delivered right to our door in a timely manner and in perfect condition we do not have satellite or cable only reg antenna and were very pleased to find that we get so many more channels now and much much clearer reception now that we are picking up the digital '' signals again we love it and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to move up to hd
i searched far and wide and compared many tv 's it came down to the panasonic plasma tv the sony i went with the sony due to price but i 'm glad i did i ca n't see putting in a tv i am really pleased with the sony particularly the price i paid it was so much cheaper here at than at the big box retail stores
i purchased this television at a store on sale for less money than the 32 '' lcd screen that i was considering i was planning to place the tv on a stand not the wall and i do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the tv for comparison i am moving from a 26 '' crt hdtv to this unit the size difference is amazing but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate what surprised me is that even on or broadcasts the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous crt i 'm honestly not sure if it 's because of the size difference again larger more detail shows or because of the tv itself but it 's great my only real complaint is that i can not access an guide using the tv as the cablecard technology is only at this point however i will not penalize the tv 's rating because the cablecard technology is immature that 's not this tv 's fault i for one actually like the thought of changing a bulb every months in my tv remember the phosphor in crts and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years and that ca n't be replaced the backlight in standard lcd screens will lose brightness and go out over time and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace however this tv only has one component for which failure is expected the bulb which i can replace myself in five minutes for 200 my last pro '' is the tv 's weight i moved my old crt off of the tv stand and almost killed my back doing so i was able to lift this tv into place with almost no effort the entire unit weighs about pounds and the weight is in all the right places even though it 's light enough to lift with ease sony included one final touch that i am thankful for rubber feet i can scoot this tv on my stand without scratching the wood surface and when trying to center a tv which is nearly 40 '' wide across the front that 's a good thing
my new tv finally arrived and i am very pleased with it i picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews i could find online the vast majority of which were very positive cnet has lots of reviews as well also i have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of tvs all day every day and both of them bought this exact set for themselves my cable provider does not offer many high def stations yet so the image quality of standard def video was the primary criterion for me most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite my first impression had me rather worried i have since come to believe that poor quality standard def video is just a matter of garbage in garbage out i began to suspect this when i noticed that some stations looked much better than others in fact some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them i became convinced as i watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time the video of the host looked ok the video of one contributor was poor and the video of the other contributor looked great the video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen the set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic standard def video i expect that i just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser tvs the quality of the hi def video is breath taking was simple and i have not even bothered yet to read the manual of course the display can be adjusted in many ways but it looks good to me with the factory presets and i do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon flipping through the on screen menu i stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since i live at above sea level i was a little disappointed with the delivery situation i thought i had ordered the tv in time to have it by opening day instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season and i was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that i blame the shipper eagle usa for this not amazon i say this because i could track the package enough to know that amazon had the tv picked up right away but then eagle usa kept it sitting in dallas for almost 2 weeks and then in denver for another week before finally calling me to arrange for delivery i believe that if i had not called and emailed amazon to complain about the delay it would have taken longer eagle usa told amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but i know that this is not true for two reasons 1 i had called eagle usa the same day they told amazon this and eagle usa told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery and 2 my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and i have a very good message and caller id tracking system in place all in all a great set at a great price i just wish i had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner
i got mine locally for 1100 dollars the going rate was i saw it at a competitor for 1198 so i went to another competitor and they gave it to me for the same price and took another 100 off the price for hdtv installation what a picture i started to get turned off by sony because i had 2 32 inch crt 's with tilted yoke making widescreen movies bend at the corners but i remained loyal and i 'm glad i did i was iniitally wanting a dlp by samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away i did n't go for the 500 dollar service contract because that 's half of the price of the television i 'll take my chances on this one hopefully bulbs will come down too you 'll love the picture with or without hdtv i love all the features and they 're pretty intuitive there probably wo n't be too many left i think they 're phasing the model out not sure about amazon but the sony purchase is worth it sorry about the other bad reviews here
i bought this tv in march of this year 2006 and it has worked perfectly until the sony techs came out and updated '' my firmware i was not having any problems with the tv but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty as soon as the tech left and i turned on the tv the fan is running on high '' and is loud this did not happen until the software was updated i went into the functions and tried to use the high alt function to turn the fan to low off but that would work the good news is i bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed or replaced word of caution you may consider not updating the firmware if the tv is working and buy the extended warranty i paid 300 for 4 years and figure i 'll get at least one 250 bulb out of the deal yes it is covered otherwise the tv is perfect
brilliant images highest quality you simply can not beat this system for the price also this particular projection tv handles the channels very well not all hdtv models do this the fact is that most channels are not available in hdtv yet so it 's nice to have a high quality tv that can deliver channels to you in a high quality rendering this tv does that very well yes it 's nothing like hdtv but all the same they do a fine job with this model
we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback i 'm not sure what everyones problem is it 's not a radio tower it 's a transmitter the size of your finger i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block
i was a little tentative to order the itrip lcd because of some of the bad reviews i read it seems like there are very few people sitting on the fence with this item buyers either love it or hate it i was leaving for a trip and hoped the itrip would arrive so i could use it on my drive as luck would have it it was in my mailbox the day before i left i unwrapped it and went out to the vehicle to test it i plugged it into my ipod photo and right off the bat thought i had trouble it would n't power up i tried plugging and unplugging cleaning the contacts and finally as a last resort read the instructions after plugging it in you have to play the song before it will power on this immediately explains why so many poeple complain of doas right out of the box i set the frequency to the lowest available on the fm band and presto ! ! ! instant music i do n't live in an extremely populated area so i ca n't really comment on other stations bleeding through but loud passages are loud and quiet passages are quiet many reviewers complained of bad sound quality but you must remember this it does n't matter how great the quality of the song is on your ipod you are playing it over fm radio so it will never sound better than fm radio i inherited my father 's accord work car when he retired and it has a bare bones radio with a tone control bass and treble all rolled into one handy knob ! ! ! and cheap 6 inch speakers in the front doors when i drive i like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and occasionally music the sound quality was exactly what i expected no better and no worse i also tested it in my wife 's focus it has a nice factory 6 speaker cd system and the sound from the ipod was just fine the bass still thumped and the highs seemed just a tiny bit off but still not bad at all i am completely satisfied with the product one strange thing that i noticed that may explain why some people complain of bad sound quality is if you tap on the itrip the sound comes through your speakers much like tapping on a microphone if you were to lay it on a hard surface in your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road unless there was a defective batch sent out i do n't know where all of the complaints come from i got mine for 15 from a private seller on amazon and consider it a great purchase especially for that amount of money do n't hesitate to buy one it works as advertised and the sound quality is what it is if you keep these things in mind you wo n't be disappointed
it was not what i was expecting but still ok probably quality still all right for the price but if u want something with quality do not buy this
some people seem to have had issues but i loved mine i live in the boston area and the itrip always worked fine in the range not fantastic sound but more than adequate the portability is a huge plus as well i used it for playing my ipod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling radios at friends ' houses on and on the itrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable i have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently for the price and the convenience you ca n't beat this thing the only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of ipods
so i was a little weary to buy an itrip after hearing some mixed reviews it seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs or the itrip worked perfectly knowing my luck it would n't work for me at all i recieved my itrip and my luck started right away i tossed the itrip onto my ipod and nothing a bad omen well after i exchanged my itrip for a new one i tried it out on a short drive i live in east lansing mi and we have a very crowded fm dial i could n't find a completely blank station as recommended but it did n't matter my itrip delivered decent sound through the station as others have mentioned charging your ipod while you use your fm transmitter will really help it 's not a difference but it 's a noticeable improvement sure i got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal but you know what through a good 40 minutes of driving the majority of the time i had satisfactory sound this was also on the lx mode not dx supposedly dx provides a better stronger signal this product is dependant on several outside factors the reception your car gets and the availability of a clear fm channel to rate this product poorly because of factors out of it 's control is unfair there were times when i had downright poor sound and times where it was comparable to a tape deck i love good crisp sound as much as anyone does but i 'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday my recommendation after owning this product for a short time it has been used quite a bit already as i do a lot of i say if you can buy a tape deck adaptor but if it 's not an option and you do n't want to put the money into an ipod to car '' setup this is a viable solution indeed in my opinion an itrip is a better option than listening to plain old radio
it 's goo
i 've used this to burn about 3 cds and my husband has done a couple as well we have n't had any problem so far
i have used the for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it 's biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an abc '' book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use
it was a little complicated to install but i 'm not very technical but it is very easy to use i have been happy with it
i bought this about 7 months ago and never had a problem with it it take 7 minutes to burn an 80 minute cd the program reminds you to close any other open programs before burning a disc very easy to use i brun cd 's every single day it is my baby ! !
it is an excellent product easy to install really powerful the only minus is the burner software if you have or you can purchase nero or cdrwin then you can obtain the maximum performance from this unit
i bought this dream system '' to compliment my samsung 50 '' hdtv dlp television if looks could kill these two products together win hands down overall i am pleased with the system for the amount of money i invested for it sound is decent i feel it is diffidently a great acoustic system but if you are looking for the bass invest in a wired system with monster cables as like many others thoughts i was attempting to overcome an apartment predicament and wireless '' seemed to be the answer problem is the two rear speakers still need to be connected to each other via none other then a wire so if you are looking for a truly wireless gig continue to hold your breath because sony has figured out how to eliminate point a to point b but point b to point c remain dreamless
this product is awesome course it 's a sony SMILE what else can i say
i started searching for wireless surround speakers due to the configuration of my apartment a wired solution simply would not work due to the location of my couch and the distance from my tv after searching for a while there were only a couple options available the sony a system by panasonic that had an optional wireless option and a wireless receiver kit made by kenwood after looking at reviews of all of the different options the sony appeared like the best choice i 'm very happy with that decision dvds look great on my hdtv with the upscaling feature be forewarned if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive hdmi cable and your tv will need to be support it i bought a belkin cable instead of monster and it was still over 100 dvds also sound terrific the surround is impressive for a wireless solution like any stereo it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker and i pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel the subwoofer as others have stated is pretty powerful for a passive speaker there could be more depth to the sound however it is an out of the box solution and i think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it 's default sound level others have complained that cds do n't sound good i disagree i 've played several cds and i think they sound great i also input my ipod through the audio inputs and that sounds pretty great too again like any receive you 'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking overall i 'm very happy with this system
i purchased the sony system over the internet it surprisingly arrived in only a few days assembly and wiring instructions were done well it looks good and matches well with my sony hdtv the sound quality is just fine for movies and tv programs but fair at best for listening to music on cd 's or from the fm tuner and compares to an inexpensive stereo the base is not tight and kind of whoompy although there is plenty of it i actually had to decrease it by 3 db the many sound stages are remarkably different and have a true sense of being there such as the sport '' which does sound like being in a stadium most of the time it is best in auto '' performing in the method the audio was recorded the ir works well but there are still plenty of wires for the rear speakers such as ac power for the amp a wire from the ir receive to the amp and wires from the amp to both rear speakers not as clean as one might imagine from the product description as mentioned in previous reviews the 5 disk changer is very slow and rather tricky to insert a disk until you get the knack a 5 disk change is not necessary as the system would probably be used with dvd 's for watching movies as opposed to inserting multiple cd 's to listen for music i certainly would prefer my stereo for that ! over all i am satisfied with it and recommend it it performs well for what it was intended to reproduce sound from movies and tv again it is a good looking system
i ordered a lexar media multi card reader i did n't know there was such a thing when it came everything worked perfect and for a price everyone could afford
completely satisfied with the lexar media multi card reader simple and easy to use
easy to hookup and windows xp displays the drives of the lexar easy to drag and drop files into the drives highly recommended
well i ended up buying mine on closeout from radio shack for i love mine the sound really is great and the price was awesome ! i use mine for dvd 's my tv 's regular sound for all tv i watch and also as a tuner to listen to the cd 's in surround sound some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers i do n't know if this helps or not but i will i had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and i did not put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit i thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference so if you have that whine make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment mine does not make any noise on standby or skip at all either i am very happy with mine
i have owned this system since march the sound is wonderful definetly a great value for the money the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers are n't used as much as i thought they would be but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money music sounds great dvd is fine for the most part no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time recycling the power corrects the problem it will also plays cd 's that i burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do and unless you are a sound snob this system will work fine for you and if you are a sound snob why are you even considering this one go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one ca n't compar
nice sound i will admitt for the price i get big sound with quality only thing is a humming hissing sound when machine is idle ohtherwise worth it
i puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance the dvd playback is fantastic you really feel the surround sound and the speakers work well it can get pretty loud too the only minor issue i have is when i 'm in tv '' mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low i 've experiemented with all of the modes but ca n't seem to be able to get them up to the volume i would like this is not a problem when playing a dvd or using the radio tuner however set up was extremely easy and a complete '' great system for a great price
this dvd system is sweet the sound system is off the hook its worth your doller
this home theater system is great ! it was fairly easy to setup with detailed instructions once connected the sound is phenomenal and clear highly recommended for the price you pay
the item ordered performs well in what it is supposed to do
great item for homes lacking phone jacks easy to set than trying to hard wire
works great ! ! ! i have a flat roof that does not allow me to add a phone line and the only way to use my satilite system is with a long phone cord accross my room this jack extension helped me eliminate the long ugly cor
ok i got this as gift so i got nothing to lose right ! well this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i got ta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle ever since i unpacked this little thing it has been with me everywhere ! on the go exercise sleeping you have pockets to put it ipod shuffle is always with me whenever i needed some kick of tunes its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 gb of stores for about 16 hrs of playtime it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me lol ! sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and tunes on the go so if you are a fast paced mobile and not a control freak then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it
the ipod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other ipods i 've had one break on me and my new one does n't work on the shuffle '' setting when listening to podcasts what i use my shuffle for on the other hand the ipods do n't do the things i need a shuffle for mainly be really really small and pretty indestructable however i have n't tried out any of the new generation of ipods so they may solve one or both of these difficulties
this printer produces prints on postcard paper that look like they came from a photo lab the quality is fantastic and the relatives were in awe i am very very happy with the printer and the canon camera i use it with i now have a portable print studio do not confuse this printer with ink jet printers it uses dye sublimation a completely different printing process the result is something that looks and feels like a glossy photo postcard not a piece of paper you do n't put ink in it so there is no ink to jam your print nozzles since neither exist in this printer you buy the equivalent of ink and paper in kits made from canon for example
this printer was very easy to use just pop in the cartridge paper and plug in the camera the camera has to be a certain type of canon but there is an available computer cable i have not gotten it yet to hook up other cameras the benefit of using a canon camera with this printer is you can travel without a computer and still print out pictures these pictures look beautiful and the colors are true and bright printing could n't be easier and fast i was able to get a print while my 2 year old was frantically trying to pull the plugs press the buttons and all arms and legs struggling it 's fun watching the three colors slide in and out in the three passes the printer makes to process the picture instant gratification
if you own a canon digital camera this printer is great it is portable and makes great prints people think they are from a photolab it is also vey easy to use i have seen other mini printers from olympus and sony and they are not as good they cost more too
this is very well designed it give you 4 usb port but two on opposite sides this is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides you webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right the cord that plug in from the hub to the computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the hub in all kind of angles it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires it also works great if you jsut want to charge you usb devices on the go it come with a plug in ac adapter so you do n't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices
i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must '' plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gon na fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice
this review pertains specifically to the targus 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub the cord is about 2.5 feet long long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk it has a cable which is split into two usb plugs one just to transmit data the second to power the unit the second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways if you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately in short if you have an old school machine with usb ports which are inaccessible to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk
it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin
pros small cute comes with a power adaptor i have 6 devices hooked up to it including 2 usb hard drives and it works fine without the adapter a big plus for me most hubs would not work with this setup usb 2.0 1.1 6 devices hooked up 3 low speed and 3 high speed all work very well runs cool cons not sure why but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and ports on the other this is dumb if you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward all ports should be on the back and leds on the front here the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you do n't see them the hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated overall the best hub i 've ever had and i tried many
it 's a simple device so there 's not to say about it other than it does the job you should note that the leds on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your pc and the pc is powered they glow a bright blue
this hub takes care of old power issues i had with smaller unpowered hubs it is handling my pda usb jump drive high capacity external drive and printer and i still have 3 more ports and i have n't had any usb power alerts from my computer since i added this hub it does what it says
lovely my pictures are so nice an like the other cards i had where the pictures came out so blurry i would recommend this card to anyone who needs it thanks rvc n
i recently purchased this as a replacement for my monster cable i must say that i am quite impressed this is the best fm transmitter i have encountered i live in seattle there is a fairly saturated fm dial and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals that said i only have minor problems with interference the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges functionality is pretty much seamless in my car i drive a 2003 ford focus the power jack is position to the left of my in dash cd changer so accessibility is not an issue if anyone is in the market for an fm transmitter for their ipod i highly recommend this one that 'll do pig that 'll do
i have been using this transmitter with my ipod photo for a few days this stuff work flawlessly and the transmission was strong enough i tune the same radio frequency from another car and the sound still clear enough if there was an interference all i have to do just to the empty channel this stuff will overpowering the other channel if available the only drawback for me is once you plug the arm connector to the transmitter it will hard to again it might broke the plastic construction if you are not careful
i tried two different devices before this one and they simply did not work satisfactorily in a big city with a very crowed fm band dlo transpond is excellent i drive through sao paulo brazil which is a huge city with almost 20 million habitants and consequently many fm stations in the dial occasionally i need to switch station but most of the time the same works fine all day long wherever i have to drive mounting was simply i use the extension arm provided to get a handy and firm location in short i am totally satisfied
the dlo transpod works perfectly with no static i was hesitant to purchase this i thought because it works through the radio there would be some interference or static well i was wrong and pleasantly surprised i was so pleased with this product i purchased one for my husband and my sister and two friends bought one too for anyone who has an ipod this is a must have ! another great feature is that the transpod charges your ipod while you are listening to it i have never needed to charge my ipod you can set this up any way you want it in your vehicle it takes up very little space this product is definitely money well spent and i highly recommend it to anyone with an ipod
i bought this tv for college and it fits perfectly in my dorm the picture quality is pretty decent though compared to traditional tv it is not as sharp the audio quality is very good i was able to play final fantasy 12 with this tv and the audio lives well for my expectations no lag while playing my playstation 2 console the only downside is that if you want to switch from av mode back to tv mode you need to press source '' on the remote or the tv 4 times and it 's annoying waiting for it but besides that it 's a very nice budget tv for anyone that wants a tv that can save you some money and space
i was very surprised at how good the color is on this tv i 've has it for a year and love it and many friends have bought one and liked it as well it 's a great price for a lcd tv
for those who expect true 5.1 dolby surround out of the bose system please look elsewhere this unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area you need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised i bought this system probably a month or two after it came out maybe 4 or 5 years ago and it 's still going strong i owned an apartment and was n't to keen on marring the walls with multiple speakers for a 5.1 system or running a plethora of cable around the living room and mounting every speaker on a stand so this system fit the bill quite nicely did i know i was n't really going to get a spectacular surround sound experience of course i did the big drawback to this system is really the lack of component video i only wish it had component video but it was put out too early and then of course the second version came out and it had component and there i was kicking myself and still kicking myself for those who complain that it does n't play all videos i will say this i have also had issues with it not playing videos what i discovered was that it was n't the dvd 's but the transfers or the video type vcd has issues svcd mostly plays and of course every commercial dvd i have used has always played unless there was something wrong with the dvd itself like it was scrached or had too many fingerprints and such on its surface bottom line is that when i keep my dvd 's clean my bose system is friendly if you 've got bootleg dvd 's do n't expect them to play in your bose dvd they probably wo n't work more to the point they probably should n't work becuase you should n't buy bootlegs anyway
having owned this system now for a couple of years i have had my ups and downs but overall i am pretty happy with it for the price you are getting a system that produces excellent clarity of sound with very small speakers yeah ! on the negative i do n't really understand why they skimp out on the dvd side of i mean my 200 pioneer handles the range of dvd 's much better of greatest concern for me though has been voice voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem it does n't do a very good job consequently it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and dvd 's also just a small note to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud so if you do n't care too much for neighbours that wo n't be a problem overall my music sounds crisp and i love hearing every little noise in my music so i still have a smile on my face
i live in a small home and a large 5 speaker system with plus reciever and player was just too much true the does n't have a lot of the bells and whistels of a lot a less expensive systems but the size ease of assembly and most of all the sound was worth the initial sticker shock
bose 321 is a nice stuff and good for the room the sound is clear and crisp a lot better than a usual mini component no need to set up an elaborate sound system because this will do the and easy to use good quality sound for such a small piece thou a little expensive but no regrets because its a bose im a satisfied customer so far i dont have problems please dont let me have one
this charger is really good value for money this charger shows each battery 's status individually and charges them quickly i did not monitor the time to count the minutes and seconds but it was reasonably fast also refresh feature is best i like the looks and functions of this charger
we used this charger with a dc inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a sony camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges the battery is great
charging indicator actually works great and gave this little gadge quite a space age looking charges battery pretty fast although not like the fastest charger i used but those chargers could make battery over heat constantly the build of the charger however is a little bit on the weak side compare to the one i previously owned generally well worth the money good buy !
you can never ask for more from this product that 's huge runs my discman for weeks i roughly listen 1 hr everyday the digital display is very good and accurate the refresh feature is what makes it different from other similar products now forget about the memory '' bug in your battery given the price it is worth your while
overall a very nice charger though recharge times are n't even close to what is advertised the display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair the 900 mah hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless
if you are trying to get a good quality charger then sony is made for you pros 1 looks good 2 battery indicator 3 can charge single at a time 4 auto power cut off 5 also works with in europe 6 sleek and light wiegth 7 refresh button works really good to get ur battery back cons 1 its fast but not that fast it also depends on the batteries you are using 2 if started refreshing then will take more time still its good
this is the second wacom tablet i own and the third tablet in general the other wacom is the 9 x 12. which at the time i thought was the greatest and the hyperpen my first tablet for a starving artist well do n't do n't buy it stay away horrid thing save up and get a small wacom with the purchase of my 6 x 11 i realized that it just feels right the size is not so large it becomes unmanageable but big enough to use with my dual 19 inch monitors and with proportional aspect ratio on it does not waste a lot of the tablet area the touch stripes are useful but really not necessary only with it sitting in your lap pushed back from the keyboard does it really offer any usability the 6 x 11 is just about perfect
having the wacom has increased my speed and efficiency in editing pictures it is the best investment i have made lately in my business it saves my wrist from carpal tunnel and other problems related with high mouse useage i can be much more precise on my work in photoshop ! i would recommend this as a tool to add to any photographers must have list ''
this is a great product and company the install was free of problems and the tutorial on the cd got me up to speed in a couple of minutes
it 's a great item i 'm loving it it 's been veru helpful in my scrapbook
the tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad the mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks opening programs is one of them it also has a scroll wheel on the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling i use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with the pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines it fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser the only complaint i have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them the lower one is placed in a spot where when i 'm drawing my finger frequently hits it because of this i simply had to make the button inactive over all i feel that wacom has done a very good job of developing this product i feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price i would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet it is nice to have if you have the desk space i 've heard wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that i own one i believe it
this product is wonderful i have had it for about a month and use it with adobe photoshop and corel painter ix and it still amazes me in my research i saw that many people were purchasing the size maybe for price however if you have a widescreen format monitor like myself you will be much happier with the once you are over the short learning curve you will find you even use it over your mouse for regular computer use
title tablet publisher wacom publish date unknown reviewer robert saucier rating 5 stars in 1997 after buying a new pentium ii system i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet oh my ! pointer control assignable function pads it was heaven after a couple of years every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application my computer would spontaneously reboot a bit i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but as technology marched on my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats sadly i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away lately i 've been feeling the pull once more that urge to use a pen to do photo instead of my mouse miraculously a wacom by tablet dropped almost literally into my lap sleek gray sexy with a pen much like my coveted pilot pens and a mouse ! even better the comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities adobe elements 4.0 corel painter essentials 3 and nik color efex 2.0 le heaven just got better ! the has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution over twice that of the wacom graphire product line and with its usb 2 connection there 's more than enough communication bandwidth meaning better tablet to application response one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else the driver has been in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me i 've used all of my usual '' programs and have had no problems at all the tablet has also been peacefully with two external drives a wireless desktop receiver a card reader a scanner and a printer all riding the same usb bus the has 8 chordable '' buttons 4 at each side of the tablet to which keys macros or other actions may be assigned the default for each group are the usual alt and shift along with space '' the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet holding one or more of the buttons while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand being chordable you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context the ends of the strip in keystroke mode can be set to playback macros the pen with its stylus and eraser '' also has a duoswitch the duoswitch 's two positions may also be programmed the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback with the ergonomic grip the pen is extremely comfortable to hold the mouse designed to be used by either righties '' or lefties '' is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility this is more than acceptable as with every other feature associated with the the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options although i 've yet to find the fix photo '' illustrate article '' or even the design website '' settings i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already this feature would be the feather on the cap to me the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire and was on the artz ii sometimes having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time for the casual home user i would recommend the graphire product line this model 's srp of 369 may be a bit high where a 99 entry point on the graphire is more affordable for the or professional however whether doing photo editing my primary use or illustration the line is well worth the investment it 's great to be in heaven again
i 'm a cow and like most cows i use photoshop heavily all i can say is that i can not believe that i went as long as i did without this tool other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes one thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode i use a 24 '' dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and i was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration wacom definitely did their homework to be honest i found it to not be that useful in max but in photoshop it 's a wmd
ok if you have two monitors side by side or a single format this is the way to go ! i use this tablet with the mac with full functionality and 1024 levels of pressure from the pen to the screen i have used the smaller tablets from wacom and they work very well but this particular product is designed and constructed very well and makes the left right monitor design a breeze to use ! having the assignable expresskeys '' left and or right is really slick for repetitive tasks this model stands '' 10 and '' deep front to back and just under 16 and '' wide take two late model white mac keyboards and set them one behind the other and that is about the footprint this item covers width and depth so you will need some desk space or i have found myself using this item on my lap with the pen quite comfortable ! in any scenario this is by far one of the greatest products you could add to have the flexibility to be creative with whatever application you use thanks wacom
the sandisk sd is a product it holds up very well to everyday use the plastic casing and button is very solid not flimsy or cheaply made like some other brands in this price category in august 2006 i bought two sandisk cards new 30 each as extra memory for my palm tx pda and they work great for storing pictures video files backup data and programs i also use them every day with a usb adapter for backing up pc files and transferring data to and from home and work they work flawlessly before i bought the sandisk i had a bad experience with a corsair card about the same price which had a little faster speed than the sandisk but it was so cheaply made that it started falling apart within 2 months including the button which fell off when i plugged it into my sd reader slot arrrgghhh ! i have been very pleased with the sandisk sd and at 30 new i believe it 's the best buy for the money one web search will show you that this card sells new all over the place for more than twice this price and oh yeah stay away from used '' cards who knows where they 've been or how long they 've been used for me it 's not worth it to take a chance with my data on a used card i hope this review helps the sandisk sd new is a smart choice
this card is not too fast but good enough for my camera well that means nothing to me i do n't have your camera and i could buy it for other things there are 65 reviews as i 'm writing this and nobody has contributed speed tests not even estimates ! the ones that do n't mention speed at all might not care but those who do should at least give approximate timings the easiest way to do this is by plugging the card into your card reader not your camera or other specific device as the device can be limited in speed then select a bunch of image files or any other files at least couple of hundred mb worth of files and copy them to the card time this divide the total mb amount by the time in seconds and you will get approximate information of this card 's write time ! do the opposite to test the read time this wo n't be 100 exact but if at least 2 or 3 people do this we 'll get a pretty good idea of the card 's speed capabilities
the delivery and the product was good i got what i was expecting
after i purchased this card i have travelled a lot and have taken several pictures it just works perfect with my canon digital camera
so much cheaper than buying a flash player i 've had this and other similar sandisk memory cards for up to two years without a problem have dropped them repeatedly with no loss of data transfer speeds could be quicker for taking photos but overall a great buy especially as it expands the capacity of my treo 650 to five full length movies or cds worth of music i only wish someone would make a practical case that could hold multiple secure digital 're so compact i have to be careful not to misplace them
i bought 2 of these cards and use them in my treo i can fit several movies and tv shows on each card which makes for a quick commute on the or even a nice getaway over
this sd card is pretty good and of course very very cheap maybe the speed is a little bit slow comparing with other sd card but it wo n't cause too much proble
it is very good on memory storage it can keep my photos much more than 800 photos however with pretty big memory my camera is so slow that i have to wait for one miniute before it is ready to take photos
fabulous product now i can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range happy i purchased this one very trouble free
we really loved the item the size of the flash drive is perfect ! we have a tight spot to insert the driver and this item fits perfect
i like the size the speed on reading and writing is usually just fine but when writing a group of small files it takes ages
my opinion will probably differ from other reviewers this strap works well if you have the extended battery pack installed on the camera as to be expected it is quality and would be handy for those who like to keep their camera in their hand ready for action shots personally i went back to the neck strap because if using the hand strap the camera is tied to your hand and that hand is unusable for much of anything else without putting the camera down if you 're out roaming around the neck strap frees your hands up reducing your fear of dropping the camera eliminates the possibility of setting it down for a second and having it disappear and with the neck strap the camera is readily available i have to give it a 5 star due to the fact that it does exactly what it was designed to do and quality made mark h
i originally bought this for my with the batterygrip and when it arrived found that no instructions on how to safely attach it were included after a bit of googeling i found those in the mkiin manual downloadable from canons web site and it felt pretty secure it certainly helps when you are using larger lenses and its good value for the money i have now upgraded to a mkiin and have moved the strap to that body if you find it hard to use the main dial you have probably tightened the strap too much
i would n't be without this when i first bought the it was my first digital slr and i spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap in the end i settled for using both and would n't have it any other way with the battery grip and hand strap in place i find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold that 's all there is to it that 's what it does and it does it well on the down side and it 's a small and transient down side actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you 'd sort of expect it to be insecure i think the trick security wise is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap if used i also do n't like the attachment to the neck strap i do n't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use i use this on a which typically has a or lens attached you can only use this if you also use the battery grip or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location but since i always use the battery grip i do n't have an issue if canon read this you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price you normally pay close attention to detail and it 's a bit lacking here
i bought htis accessory because i do not fancy pretty much the neckstrap i hate to feel my neck aching after a while due to the weight of my plus battery grip and lens i rather to carry it in my hand instead so i thought this handstrap would give me the extra safety feel i was needing after receiving it i noticed it is only intended to be used with grand cameras '' like the eos 1 series film or digital or to those other series cameras that already have a battery grip attached to them fortunately that 's my case in which i always carry my with its i tell this since a drebel or body does not have a strap eyelet on its base only their compatible battery grip has it so be aware that this nice safe and comfortable accessory could not be attached to your prosumer camera if you do n't have the corresponding bg
i owned the canon eos which i sold to obtain the '' eos mark ii my first model came with this handstrap and i found it to be very very useful and incrediby imporant me being an imagine my dismay and anoyance at discovering that this item which was so useful and imho absolutely necessary as my wonderful handstrap which was included in the previous model had been left out of the newer and so much improved '' version i 've called and emailed canon repeatedly which i strongly suggest do trying to bring attention to this issue which to me is unexpected and a completly unacceptable discrepancy then consider the 30 plus dollars that canon is trying to charge for it and well here i go off to my old fateful amazon to get me one ! ! actually its from adorama and only about 20 bucks instead as for my review of the strap itself if you have n't yet gathered considering the cameras weight and me constantly running up and down dirt hills chasing motocross racers and the like i found it literally indespensible ! highly recomended ! ! bob moxion digital production
this is the best alarm clock i have ever had ! we live in the mountains and the self setting mechanism still worked within 10 minutes two alarms and more features than i ever dreamed of
the other reviews i am reading about this clock do not do it justice i just opened it 20 minutes ago and it 's on my desk already synched with the atomic clock i am very impressed the green led is awesome ! i own a lot of atomic clocks and this is the first led one i 've seen besides the one this thing is solid and it looks like it was made in the 60 's or 70 's when you had heavy quality electronics in a tight package this is worth way more than the selling price
when i received it i read the quick set up and plugged it in and within 5 monutes everything was running the digits on the clock were just the right size that i could see without my glass from accross the room the radio was not high fidelety but satisfactory
tengo ya mucho tiempo utilizando los discos memorex tanto dvd como cd y siempre han resultado ser muy buenos por lo general los compro en el momento en que estan en oferta que en amazon casi siempre asi es los recomiendo ampliamente los que tienen malos comentarios al respecto posiblemente se debio al proceso de quemado programa o quemador
i have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of memorex and so far i have not had any problems they work just fine on my sony dvd burner
memorex 's are the best price keeps dropping and never have a problem
memorex dvd blanks are my second choice and i bought two stacks of these because they had a great deal going on in a perfect world i would have gotten the same deal on stacks of maxell dvd blanks they are the best but you 'll have a hard time finding a deal on them since everyone else knows they are the best
i bought this product after reading several reviews here at amazon the setup to configure it to my cable system was a little tricky but once we got passed that it worked like a charm i have only lost one recording on one of my dvds it 's strange how that happened since the dvd was n't in the player at the time but that was almost a year ago and it has n't happened since then this recorder is intuitive and simple to operate the conversion from video to dvd is flawless and the finalization process is easy to understand as well i especially like how you can adjust the recording time mine 's currently set to about four hours i am totally blind and needed a product that was easy for me to operate without sighted assistance this definitely fills the bill ! if you 're looking for a great product at a reasonable price buy this one ! you wo n't be disappointed ! i 've converted almost 50 videos and recorded several tv shows with this recorder ! great buy
this is an excellent machine i bought two of them there are a few things you need to do i have had 100 satisfaction using fujifilm up to i have had success with fujifilm up to also had tremendous success with tdk up to and some other brands may not work one thing learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little go recording 3 or 4 or dvds every day give it a rest between recordings one or two per day is okay definitely give it room to breathe if you stack your machines on top of each other put something in between so they can breathe be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides you definitely need to buy a panasonic dvd player to play back your dvds other brand dvd players may not play your recordings properly one of the greatest things about this machine is that it records they are for many many times and each program can be erased when watched you can even edit the recordings on the cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program only works on the i have over 50 discs panasonic brand they sure take up less space than vcr tapes ! get one or two of these recorders and a panasonic dvd player and got it made ! throw away your vcrs forever ! just remember to baby them
i noticed there are several reviews on various products here but this review is on the panasonic the s is for silver i am not a technological wizard and impatient so my husband set this up for me i 've had it about 5 months now and love it this is on the tv upstairs i bought it because i was having trouble with our old rca dvd recorder unreliable but that 's another review once setup it is complete the unit is very easy to use i read lots of reviews before buying and realized the cons that others had were not of concern to me we do n't have hdtv yet so ratio not important all i needed was something to record things from my tivo unit and a dvr that could record on multiple dvd formats dvd ram featues i like i like the ample space the unit allows for actually typing in the name of the show unlike the rca which only let you have a few characters i really use the flexible recording feature to exactly fit a movie or to fit lots of shows i did have to play around with this feature to figure out how to work it while recording multiple shows on one disk manual was n't useful with that part but i use it all the time the picture is really good even with a 6 hour recording time which i use for my decorating shows the change thumbnail feature is also great it allows you to select what picture displays when you browse through the programs this is a wonderful feature that is important to me esp with decorating shows where i have the thumbnail be a feature of the room that i like after reading some of the reviews here it seems my unit has a lot of cool features which would be great for someone who is into electronics i am a basic girl so i do n't need a lot of bells and whistles i just need it to do what i want without any hassles and without reading a manual my only quibble is that some of the buttons on the remote are kind of small even for my smaller female hands the rca that i put on the tv downstairs is starting to mess up a lot now so i will be purchasing a new unit i 've read reviews on the but since i am happy with this unit i am going to buy another one
i bought this for my folks for christmas it took no time at all to hook up and making dvds was simple everything from recording off the tv to recording movies and shows stored on the dvr to transferring home movies from the original vhs tapes i 'm sure for about 300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders but for under 200 you really ca n't go wrong the only flaw i could find is that the initial hookup according to the book did n't seem quite right after taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online everything went smoothly because of that i 'm still going to give it a full 5 's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life really if you 're new to this technology you 're not going to have any
got ihome for christmas last year and i still love it ! i read the reviews that ihome work well well read the instructions first ! ! it works perfect for me the alarm the radio the ipod everything is just right i am a light sleeper too i could never fall asleep with the light on but this one bother me at all ! just learn to use it easy i also like the size of it its not to small not to big great to put on your nightstand and wake up to it to your ipod radio or buzzer i recomend ihome highly
a good add on to ipod compared to other costly or cheap products the sound is good it is loud enought to fill a medium hall with music the and sleep funtions are good the buttons are not smooth kind of make noise i wish we could forward and skip songs from the base you can dimmer the if not needed recommend it
this item is very nice its practical becuase have a gos size great sound and in only one iten you can have a radio clock and sound for your ipod i recommend i
im probably one of few people on here who has a positive review for this item ! i got this for christmas from my dad i believe he bought it at best buy ive had it for almost ten months and i havent had any problems it still plays the ipod the clock still works the date still works and everything else still works you dont even need to change the time theres a switch on the back that lets you change it from standard time to daylight savings time i dont know why people are complaining about that and the light the light isnt that bright if i encounter problems i will write another review but so far everything is perfect
i 've had my sandisk for about 2 months now and i love it i only use it while working out so i wanted an inexpensive alternative to an ipod ipods in my opinion are over rated and too expensive especially if like me you would only use it less than an hour a day i know several people who have had so many problems with their ipods i have had no trouble at all with the sandisk it comes with an armband and plastic protective case to prevent the screen from getting scratched its a great little player if you ca n't afford the hype of an ipod
this product was a corporate gift and the recepient loves the gift i selected this product based on the recommendation of from other reviews the product is easy to use holds nearly 200 songs and great for exercising or use in the car
i searched and searched for the right player to use when i work out and although this one had some bad reviews so did all the others i looked at so i was a little scared but went ahead and bought it and i 'm so happy ! it 's so cute and sounds great ! ! ! very glad that i choose this one
i 've had my sansa the white one with a pink silicone case very cute for about a month now and i could n't be more pleased i 've had several players an archos an iaudio ' and though both had their quirks especially the archos ultimately the problem with both was the same their rechargeable internal batteries wore out and would n't hold a charge anymore in contrast the sansa takes one aaa battery such a simple thing but what a joy i 'll have the player long enough to see if it wears out normally from use ! it comes with a battery and i have n't had to change mine yet radio reception seems rather good it does n't have recording as the iaudio did but i did n't use that very much and have n't missed it has voice recording which i have n't tried mounts right up on winxp without any need for extra software i 've never wanted an ipod because of the nightmarish software required to negotiate with them the sansa 's supplied ear buds sound very good but are a trifle large which is probably why they sound so good to me noticeably larger than ipod ear buds but are a little too large for my ears one more thing i am pleased with the sansa 's interface there are enough buttons to comfortably handle all functions the ' had only a few buttons a tiny display and no manual to speak of and was a little frustrating to use the sansa is much clearer has a very readable display and very straightforward function selection and settings cleverness and simplicity is all well and good in a gadget but take it from someone whose vision is not terribly good if you ca n't see it you ca n't use it i 'm glad i got this one
the software provided with the unit worked well i bought another player from another manufacturer that locked up the computer the menus are easy to use and it has a nice feature where you can pause the music and the sansa player will automatically shut off if you do n't hit the play button again my only complaint is the unit eats a lot of it is best to go with rechargables i get about 6 hrs playback time per battery
i 've been using neato and the 'mediaface ' software for years i love the ability to calibrate the output so i can create 2 sided cd booklets that line up perfectly ! sure you have to do a little test printing but that 's what gives you the control this is definitely not for the dumb and dumber set if you want software and label materials that are 'designed with your mind in mind ' and do n't want creative control then this is not for you i use it for cd booklets cd labels and jewel case inserts all on glossy paper and folks think the results are professionally done if you do n't want to put in the effort the get something else but if you like the freedom to express your creativity this will give you the room you need
and i 'm still happy ! we initially had to get used to the software and the printer setup and yes you do need some patience during the learning curve of this creative process it 's not the normal daily routine of most people we never encountered any errors when creating the actual labels or printing them we also have not had any problems upon using the labelled cds or dvds we 're happy with the product
the cost plus shipping still beats the sale price of a similar item at walmart works fine
this is a great product and you can get it along with any other products on amazon up to 500 free ! participate in a special promotion and get a free 500 amazon gift card at this web site
i have nothing to compare them to but i bought 3 of these and they seem to do the job they are intended to do i was surprised to see no savings on shipping when i ordered 3 vs ordering 1 at a time although i am now clear on the policy they still were a bargain as far as i have compared i would buy again from the same vendor
i received my kingston sd card just as advertised the unit came in the mail exactly 2 days after i ordered worked perfectly and i 'm very satisfied
i was excited when i received the kingston digital card on the scheduled date it sure has a good packaging and works great an item worth having in your electronics line
i have had no problems with the secure digitial card from kingston it has performed properly for my camera and computer for transferring the pictures highly recommende
i use this card in my palm tx pda and have it filled with music and in almost two months have had no problems with it very good memory
hi i brought 256 mb kingston sd card from recently according to my openion amazon is one of the best online shopping market they deliver the products intime and the items i brought so far are working very well 256 mb kingston sd card working very good with out giving any problem one can always go to amazon for online shopping bye kira
i received it in a timely manner and am pleased with the performance of the product it may not be a top name brand but i ca n't tell any difference thank yo
i bought this card with my canon powershot the card holds a lot of pictures more than i expected even with a high resolution setting
i bought this for my laptop and have been very happy with it i love the compact size it 's so easy to store in my laptop bag the performance is great
this usb hub is excellent ! ! its small and compact it actually communicates at usb 2.0 speeds and the best part is that it does n't need a separate power supply just to opperate this hub is designed to get all the power it needs from the usb port overall this is the most well designed hub i 've seen and with it having such a low price tag you ca n't go wrong
i have pluged 3 usb connection hp all in one optical mouse portable usb i have used the product for 1 mounth with no problems the size color are cool
this is a very usefull product performs well and stores easily makes a great addition to my laptop
the one i got in the mail was black very happy about blue did n't exactly go with my laptop setup it is very small and can easily be stored in your laptop case or anywhere else you might want to put it seems very sturdy and the usb cables do not come out easily which is very nice
this little hub is just about everything you could want it to be it 's extremely compact i do n't think it 's physically possible to have a smaller 4 port usb hub at the same time it 's also very solid and feels durable the hub provides plenty of power and charges my ipod a handy led light turns on when the hub is plugged into your computer i have n't done any formal benchmarks but my ipod updates at the same rate as it normally does when connected directly i suppose that the hub does impose a certain bandwidth limit so that you can not have 4 devices transferring at the full usb 2.0 transfer rate at once but that 's to be expected this would be excellent for any laptop user with a dearth of ports or someone who just happens to need to connect a few more devices to their already maxed out system
got it for an early xmas present and could n't be happier the price looks and performance ca n't be beat !
a great player slim outline and if you have a hdtv to plug it into then there is nothing like it out there i have it hooked up to my sony bravia lcd tv via a hdmi cable even if you do n't have a hdtv or a tv with hdmi port you can still use component cables dvd picture quality and sound quality is crisp and sharp great bu
i have purchased this dvd player to replace an older version of sony dvd player that started to have problems playing dvds especially the scratched ones besides that i wanted to have a capability to play other formats including photo discs i think this was the right choice for the money the dvd player handles every task as expected sony did n't disappoint
the other effusive reviews are the picture is fabulous on new dvds lord of the rings nemo harry potter a 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job we have the sony 42 '' rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination a few annoyances the machine responds and loads slowly but that 's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price and certain dvds of old movies some like it hot the king and i stretch the picture horizontally making things look squat i 'm sure there 's a solution but just ca n't figure it out any tips
the device works perfectly the picture quality is excellent the documentation is adequate and the overall robustness of the machine seems good loading is slower than my old dvd player a toshiba i really like the way i can watch one dvd part way through replace it with another and have the player still remember my place in the other one i also appreciate the hdmi interface but have not upgraded my television to take advantage of it yet in the end i was willing to spend a few extra bucks for a quality player and based on performance so far that 's what i got
this dvd player provides a picture to my 46 '' sony tv with that is very close in quality to hd broadcasts the only way to watch a dvd movie nowadays
using the hdmi output provides a hd quality picture i 'm not sure if more expensive units have a better picture but i doubt it save your money and buy this unit instead of investing in an hd unit that has only a few movies available in the new format
great and easy to use dvd 's look amazing via the hdmi on my sony 50 '' sxrd home entertainment at its best
i have been thrilled with the quality of this player i bought it for the hdmi connection high definition multi media interface the player has performed with everything that i have thrown at it the dts is incredible and i believe this unit is worth every penny do n't settle for a phony buy a sony
if you are looking for quality in video equimpent there is only one brand for me sony the dvd player has slick design great video output we watched the latest star wars episode iii and the pictures were awesame ! strongly recommend
i bought this ups to help protect my tivo and tv it worked fine out of the box and when i pull the power it keeps my tv and tivo going fine
i 'm not sure what happened with 's apc ups but i have had mine for over 2 years and it has performed flawlessly whenever i 've had an electrical power outage the apc 's software notifies me that it has reverted to battery power and informs when commercial electrical power has been restored i can view the stats for my ups when and how long the last event '' battery power activation occurred and the ups current charge status my has only 6 outlets 3 and 3 surge the current 350 model provides 8 outlets 4 of each while i can replace the internal battery of my when it does die and is unrechargeable i 'll likely buy a new in the near future primarily for the extra 2 outlets
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it

bought this to free up my dvr turn recorded movies into dvd 's etc it works pretty well accurate capture easy to use not crazy about the software that 's included capwiz is ok but limited ulead video studio is clunky and sometime awkward to use although between the two you can do just abou anything you need to it works best if you record the hd version of shows even if you do n't have an hd tv the converted image is much better
vhs to dvd disc is just one easy setup i set mine to record and recode just before i go to sleep when i wake up a finished disc awaits with the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct vhs that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape i have taken many vhs tapes that were never released as dvd and now have the start of a great library editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it the product works well ipod old music videos and movies for a real treat sound is perfect
with my pentium 4 windows xp system this was extremely easy to use and did not present any technical glitches very pleased
i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd only mpeg capture device i have tried that gives a good quality picture any other device i tried only worked converting to avi 's if at all ulead 's software is stable and it 's not a trial version if i use instead of composite video computer locks up but that may be a problem on my end there are 2 different capture methods capwiz and ulead 's video studio sound was a bit behind using capwiz use vs instead would be nice to be able to set bitrate rather than be stuck with variable but now i am just nitpicking
i have lots of analog video tapes from the 80 's and onwards this device works very well in transferring them the video audio are in perfect sync pro very good device very easy to use and install you need a very powerful processor to work it right also as i discovered and mentioned in the manual you must connect this device into the primary usb port i have a hub where i first connected but the light was not coming on and the computer did not recognize the device i opened the computer and made sure that it is connected directly into the usb attached to the motherboard and it worked very well the customer service is responsive but they will not work with you on your specific computer issues cons this device is processor intensive you must have the latest processor running at mhz or above and turn off all other ancillary programs while you are converting i encountered no problems when i followed the above guidelines the minimum requirments listed by the manufacture is probably absolute minimum it is a very good product and very easy to use i love it
this product worked perfectly transferring to the computer and then using the included software to put several home movies on one dvd it also worked perfectly to transfer directly from vhsc tapes to dvd without transferring to computer very simple set up and instructions the quality of the transferred videos was excellent ! you can also clip out parts of video seamlessly if you transfer to computer first very simply with the included software you can do or add just about anything music frames voice etc no problems with the box getting hot or malfunctioning after over 4 hours of continuous use
i tryed to use this on an older 1500 megahz and had a few glitiches during the recording loss of frames then i broke out the wifes new laptop and had no problem at all the s video from my old high 8 video cam came out perfect sound was perfect too the point is you must have the power i do not care what the manufacture put on the box i would have given it 5 stars if the recomended computer requirements matched what i had to use to get the results
it took a lot of searching before i decided to purchase a good printer and this one is a great one the pictures are clear and they print fast i showed them to friends and did n't tell them that i printed them at home and they were very surprised when i told them spend the extra money and get a good printer this printer also include photo ink which is really needed for a clean print make sure you also get the right paper
that said i 'm very happy with this printer other reviews like the one on have faulted the printer for mediocre text printing i ca n't really address that complaint have a laser printer for text and only use the for printing photos and i 'm very very happy with how it performs that function it 's fast i like being able to replace the ink cartridges separately supports exif if your digital camera outputs the encrypted data and the pictures are indistinguishable from those printed conventionally it 's the perfect color printer for my advanced amateur needs
we bought this printer to go with the canon we i must say if you are considering buying it from anyone other than amazon have dealt with amazon for years and they are the best at what they do no one comes printer is so easy to setup not like some of are other are using window xp it went like a lees than 30 minutes i was printing pictures i am still learning all the features but the quality of the pictuers is as good if not better than any and it is fast fast printed 2 pictures in less than 4 minutes i have found that you do need to buy quality used the canon bordless paper first until i ran out then i switched to another brand big the right paper and you to will be amazed
i 've had this printer over a month now i have a fujifilm digital camera the quality of the photos whether or is excellent the definition and sharpness of color are fantastic the creativity potential is outstanding i 'm thrilled with this purchase
i 've had this photo printer a few weeks now i do n't consider myself technically proficient i totally scored despite gross ignorance with this machine you can not go wrong the photo quality is astonishing i 've printed professional quality photos and framed them the results are fantastic for someone who is i had this up and running very quickly
i have the digital camera canon powershot and just purchased this printer set it up last night without any difficulty and the photos i printed were fantastic i am very pleased with this purchase would highly recommend this printer i did use generic photo paper to start out with and it worked just fine i am hoping that in the long run this printer will pay for itself and cut the costs of having pics developed at the store
i 'm a working photographer who has been after several years use getting write errors on my lexar professional cf cards 1 gb and 2 gb i contacted lexar about what to do and was told that the professional cards have a lifetime warranty and they are now in the process of replacing my cards after to exposures on each quite happy with them
i purchased these cards on recommendaton of a friend who is a professional photographer that has the same camera that i purchased the canon likes these fast cards and it 's other capacities which some other point and shoot cameras may not benefit check before you buy as this card works very well with my camera
i used this cf card with my canon rebel xt write and transfer speeds are fast enough and never keeps me waiting but this works bcoz of speed acceleration technology if your camera does n't support this technology then its of no use it comes close to usb 2.0 transfer rates february update finally this card failed after formating the card will work for snaps and will hang for ever after that and then the camera will throw a write error any amount of formating did n't correct the problem finally i have to dump it and now i am using one sandisk extreme iii and another sandisk ultra ii card both are working fine even after some bad handling
bought this card as a backup for the card i normally use and it 's been fast and dependable so far my 7 megapixel camera produces large files lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera 's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting but with this card that has n't happened yet good purchase also seemed to be at the best price point in terms of storage per dollar
i had no problems with this card and the delivery was prompt thank you muc
i purchased this media card for my nikon digital camera the 5.1 mega pixal size does n't matter i still manage to get almost 400 digital photographs and hundreds more if i adjust it to 3.2 mega pixels i would recommend this media card to anyone with a digital camera
after going through the reviews i bought this cf card for my canon digital rebel so far it has worked fine though i do n't pretend to be an expert digital photographer when the card is empty it shows 127 shots available it seems to read reasonably fast though it takes a bit longer than i was used to with my olympus and its smartmedia card
after amazon got off there and decided to deliver this item which took 2 weeks everything has been really good the speed has helped my camera 's performance olympus paid 56 dollars for it and am quite satified with purchase
if you own a canon camera canon does not support wa write acceleration feature of lexar 's cards http current camera partners supporting write acceleration technology professional other than that this is a fast card if your camera supports wa otherwise it may run at just standard speed and in that case why spend the extra look up your camera on the link before you buy
i bought this item since i always make a lot of notes from books and other papers and do n't want to type it in manually anymore this scanner probably like any other model needs a little training to get it right over the paper but once done it really works and faster than typing ! i dont use the addressbook or options with your gsm but they are no doubt very handy i just scan in from papers and beam it to my laptop both infrared and the cable work the cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen the scanned text appears on the pc as you type ! the dictionary also comes in very handy it must be a very complex product but just like the ipod or zenxtra players they work ! so buy one and save some time ! excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes or studies or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train
i 'm measuring first and foremost ease and precision of scanning speed of scanning and ease of installation on the computer are in my mind about the same for both the wizcom quicklink elite and the they differ sufficiently however in the primary question of ease and quality of scanning for the record i bought both at the same time with the intent of keeping the better of the two you can just go ahead and buy the i have had one horrible experience with a pen scanner by siemens the pocket reader '' it was truly useless it scanned so poorly that i just put it aside by the time i though to return it siemens was no longer making it and i could n't get customer service here in the the wizcom quicklink elite is not so bad it 's serviceable i do n't think it lives up to its 95 accuracy guarantee but perhaps meets a 90 threshold measured impressionistically it 's interface is also reasonable and satisfactory however the is even more precise truly approaching 95 moreover if you discount errors in spacing from this accuracy percentage its precision is even higher whereas the wizcom is just as likely to make a content error misread letters the 's errors are more likely to be the absence of a space when there should be one a rare missed space does n't make you puzzle over the text when you come back to it two months later is also lighter and it 's rechargeable so while it 's more expensive in the long run you 'll save on batteries both have comparable dictionaries though wizcom has more built in or for free allows you one free dictionary including bilingual ones wizcom is a only a bit slower on the uptake but significantly more likely to warn you scan too fast '' i 've never had that from and again the precision at any speed is appreciably better with both have comparable pc and pda compatibility capacity
these are the basic clear cd dvd slim jewel cases that you are looking for they are not as easily breakable as other brands they are not recyclable
as your collections grow these are ideal for protecting and storing your treasures '' easy to open and take up little storage space the center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease just a great product
items were as advertised arrived ahead of schedule and undamaged in short the sort of product and service one should expect from any retailer
for slim jewel cases these are quite impressive their durability is outstanding and actually better than i expected usually i have been using slim cases primarily for data cds these are so convenient and durable i began using these for music cds i like them and continue to use them
two of these jewel cases equal the size of a regular cd case buy them and conserve space there great
got my order quickly and found out that these cases are much better than the ones sold here locally and they were cheaper ! !
i like keeping all my stuff in one place but do n't like cd folders so these slim cases are great i accidentaly sat on one of them and although it did crack the case did n't break and the cd was fine all in all a great product
i bought this stereo for my daughter 's birthday it 's a great system with really good sound for the size it is easy use and is super thin and can hang on the wall it does n't sit on a shelf easily it tends to fall forward because it 's heavier in front so you should plan on hanging it
i have had this for about a year and it has worked well i specifically bought it to tune into radio so i have not used the cd player and whatever functions it might have pretty light 7 of 10 sound quality can hang on wall detachable speakers good for cost i would recommend and buy for a gift
we were looking for a compact system and this particular system takes up very little space ! it also has amazing sound
i bought this stereo for my baby 's room i needed something unobtrusive with decent sound and that did n't break the bank this fit the bell just perfectly and just in case you 're wondering this unit is almost exactly the same as the 20 cheaper the only difference is that the can play cds whereas the can not both however will play and the speakers can be mounted directly on the center unit and the whole system can be hung alone or the speakers can be separated however when the speakers are separated they can not be hung on the wall themselves because there is no screw latch on the back of the speakers the speaker cords are long enough for most placements if you decide to have the speakers mounted on the unit then you will pleased to know that there is a special place for the cords to be hidden behind the main unit the only visible cord will be that of the electric plug it plays cds and cds on or cdrw well and the sound was crisp and detailed the remote control is about the size of the ipod nano but a little wider the buttons are rounded but here 's the first deficiency the keys are not backlit until you can memorize the placement of the keys you will not be able to use the remote in the dark there is a blueish backlit display on the center console it displays the track being played or the radio station in tune or in standby mode the time here 's the second deficiency the display can only be read when viewed head on i mounted mine a bit too high on the wall and i ca n't see what 's displayed there is a timer feature and a sleep function all in all this is a good system but even with the caveat that you get what you pay for the designers could 've been a bit more thoughtful in the implementation
positives design and looks good mounted on the wall songs burned on a cd sound loud enough not for parties serves the purpose well deal for the money negatives old cds skip all the new cds i burned worked perfect though turns off when the system is turned of
looks good sounds the dynamic bass boost introduces hiss but makes the sound more bassy 4 stars for looks and price -1 for sound quality
the tablet has been very helpful in my digital drawing classes and in my interior design business for quick sketching it is user friendly sturdily constructed and electronically dependable i prefer the large screen format and this size is very adequate if it should ever have to be replaced i would purchase the same model i highly recommend this particular tablet
overall this product is worth the price overview to begin the footprint of this particular tablet is 17 x 13 so you have to have enough desk or table space to accomodate it the overall finish and quality of the tablet had some issues mainly some rough casting of the clear plastic on the top ergonomically it feels at home placed on the lap with the dimensions making it quite stable the express keys feel solid though i do n't use them as much as the quick keys performance though i am a relative tablet novice i have taken to the intuos 3 better than i have with my sibling 's intuos 1. pressure sensitivity can be adjusted to suit one 's tastes making the tablet itself quite responsive the pen is light but solid i prefer the black felt tip stylus point rather than the standard plastic i have laid a sheet of vellum thick tracing paper over the tablet in order to simulate the sensation of drawing on paper i prefer some resistance the pen reacts the same as if the vellum were n't there the image area allows me to use my shoulder for more fluid movements when i draw and does not feel cumbersome at all however i have not used the tablet mouse it feels rather heavy and does not glide across the frosted plastic plate due to the layer of felt '' underneath the mouse installing the driver software is a snap and the customization menus are easy to understand note the option to switch from portrait to landscape is available in case you 're wondering which i was this tablet has made me more efficient and more productive software used photoshop
whether or not you are a or artist this tablet makes it all the more enjoyable i had an aiptek which died no less than 3 weeks from purchase date this wacom is so much better i love the customisation of it its fantastic ! only one gripe with it and it may be just me but i would love it if you were able to customise the touch strip and buttons to each program just as you can with the stylus throw your mouse away this one 's a keeper
i have been in the computer industry for well over 20 years and i have used just about every graphics tablet there is over that period i recently had a need to get a new one for my own personal use and i got this and it is one nice piece of equipment no batteries no power cords just a short usb cable to the computer and it truly is an aesthetically beautiful piece of work i have no complaints what so ever my mouse works perfectly i am even using it to play golf do n't expect to drop strokes right off the bat it will take a round or two to get used to the swing '' just like any new club '' would however i would not consider using it for any fast action games only smooth steady strokes billiards golf etc in short everything i expected and more i love this table
best ever i can tell my choice for a format was a decision taken based on my traditional arts background since i make oil paintings and traditional lineart drawing for concept arts i use very much wide strokes by a combination with wrist and arm wide motion '' so this tablet is well suited for this task not too much exagerated on size and not too small for the wide movements a wacom tablet would be more restricted to me but for those who like small area usage for drawing and painting this has a digital adjust so you can work with it as a but remember to have space on your desk it 's not a 'mouse pad ' definitively get a 19 '' monitor screen flat it down on the table that 's almost the same space you gon na need by the way for those thinking on something different from wacom tablets do n't think ! wacom is the only one you can trust 100 no doubts i 've tried many if you do n't know wich wacom suits best for you i suggest you go to they have a questionaire there to help you out but it is simple if you are a pro get this or better intuos available that 's the hardcore professional choice if do n't need much pressure sensitivity and make 'lighter ' work go to the graphire and if you are a pro and want something to work with milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get a cintiq this one is top expesive one other application will work perfect with it too like software i use xsi max maya zbrush this one only with a wacom please ! modo and many other applications for composing and editing like combustion and premiere it changes the way you work for a better productivity pen tilt is great with painter '' software what you maybe would take a day to finish you do in seconds literally with a wrist sweep and tilting the pen you can create amazing effects in one second also will reduce the stress on your hand and arm caused by the mouse it will improve your life quality by not harming you like a mouse does when you get to many our on computer besides it has programmable buttons on it and a smart scroll so you may use you mouse only for games after that another important point the usb cable is huge enough so you can work confortably away from your monitor screen with the tablet on your lap if wish so to finish i love my wacom if you buy it you will love it too and give it the accessories so this babe will get happier a travel bag replacement tips nibs kit and for sure if you can or need buy other pen like the art pen and the airbrush so you will make extraordinary artworks hope this helps on your choice best regards ! eduardo janiszewski cg artist and animato
this tablet is just great the only problem is that it 's a little to big when i want the cursor to cross the screen i have to move my entire arm not only my hand maybe inches would be the best size
i 've been using the for a few months now and i have been very happy with the product 's improvements over the intuous 2 line i love the fact that it is only about an inch thick and fits easily into my lap the intuos 2 was monstrous by comparison the only reason i give it four stars instead of five is because the mouse which should be among the most accurate mice available suffers from awful jitter i am not even touching the mouse and it is jittering up and down about a pixel or two still a very good pen tablet but the mouse part needs work
i 'm a digital media student and freelance multimedia artist and my mom is a retired commercial artist we both bought the tablet after putting up with the aiptek version for a year cons the included mouse does n't have many of the movement control features of a regular mouse i 'd recommend using a normal optical mouse along with the tablet besides you 're not buying this for its mouse pros loads of included software that you 'll actually use perfect compatibility with adobe photoshop 's features a huge discount for adobe photoshop cs is included surface is washable and scratch resistant no batteries required awesome sensitivity at any pressure or angle two pens in one top of pen works as eraser tool in photoshop and above all it 's the industry standard choice all other reviews will agree there 's no better tablet and i stand by that i 've used it with everything from adobe photoshop to adobe illustrator to macromedia flash mx to alias maya questions welcome amazonreviewfortablet jak remove
i purchased this multimedia projector on behalf of a local organization after comparing its specifications with other projectors with similar prices several comparable projectors are available currently and i chose this one because of good experience with its previous model the and slightly better specs our initial experiences with this unit have been completely satisfactory the controls are easy to use the output is bright and sharp for an audience of around 40 people i was disappointed however to discover that it has only one adjustable leg toward the front of the projector that leg is used in tilting the projected image upward but we had to use found materials to level the unit two legs would be better !
excellent image for little money ! i bought the infocus to replace a worn out and broken high end '' crt projector my budget would not allow for a more appropriate replacement while the could never satisfy the true videophile who usually spend anywhere from to dollars on a projector it was never intended to that being said i will say that the infocus when being shown on my stewart 100 '' screen is projecting an impressive image that is pretty close to the unit it replaced ! a true videophile will certainly see the difference but your average person will not with my limited budget i am quite satisfied with the very good image quality dvds are sharp and clear tv is quite satisfactory also if you are looking to enter the big screen front projector market and you do n't want to spend more than a thousand dollars here you go ! but seriously folks even though it works stop shining your projector on a wall get yourselves a screen there are special reflective properties in a screen that a painted wall does n't have to really bring your image to life
bottom line best major purchase i have made since i bought a home with a finished basement ! i got the projector and mounted it on the ceiling in my basement projecting on a wall i expected that i would need to paint the walls white or get a screen but was shocked by the amazing picture quality here are the details 1 comcast cable with hidef box hidef program is so amazing it makes me want to cry sports programing blows the mind away i even enjoy watching boring shows with the wife like the oscars just because i am so amazed at how crystal clear the picture looks you feel like you are there ! regular tv looks surprisingly great too but setting it up right is critical make sure to change the aspect ratio back to native vs when watching channels ensure that the hdtv cable box has the following settings aspect ratio controls regular programming letterbox output type controls high def programming experiment with vs overide controls regular programming i am also using the expensive 99 monster dvi cable to connect to the cable box this is essential to make regular tv look great vs grainy get the dvi to connections wires and adaptors you must budget this into your overall budget or the projecter will not be a great buy see my problem '' section below 2 i purchased the from microsoft for 20 once you buy the cables you can go into the xbox dashboard settings to allow for and most games are in and format the few games in highdef look fantastic ! you can check to see the exact resolution of every game 3 dvd player since the xbox only outputs in i wanted to try the upconversion dvd players i first tried the denon 1910. that did not work when using a dvi cable ! ! ! it might have been because it was refurbished or possibly it was because the infocus is not hdcp compliant i 'm not sure but the 1910 warns against compliant units and infocus says that is so that 's my best guess next i tried the toshiba that worked and i hooked it up using the 99 monster hdmi to dvi cable i 'm not sure if it was worth it because dvd 's look great but not amazing compared to hidef comcast programming the verdict is still out but i have never seen any of the dvd 's like finding nemo that supposedly look much better with progressive scan dvd 's i ca n't tell much difference between when dvd is set to vs hdmi output once again everybody that comes over including the sceptic wife is shocked by our basement they all say its like a theater much bigger and clearer than a regular big screen tv and i do n't even have surround sound yet that 'll be my next big purchase infocus is highly recommended but be sure to check out the problem section below problems 1 my infocus does not have any component inputs that means to get premium quality you must come through the input if you have a dvd cable box and xbox like me it is a real pain to switch the cable in the back especially with a ceiling mount i got myself a step ladder to make it easier the dvi switcher for 4 dvi cables is too expensive almost 400 2 be prepared to spend at least after you get your infocus to purchase dvi cables for the cable box possibly hdmi cables if you buy a progressive scan dvd player as well as adapters to connect your dvi cable to the computer port its definitely worth it but just be prepared in my opinion the progressive dvd player is optional saves you approx 150 but the cables are mandatory 3 no way to turn off unit with remote and yes it is still a little noisy in whisper mode but once the movie starts you ca n't hear it anymore i have it so that after it down i just turn off the entire unit on the wall switch since it is ceiling mounted
i love these cases the colors are nice the feature is helpful they keep my dvds and cds clean and are great for mailing also not one of mine has ever broken but you do need to open them correctly so as not to destroy them i ca n't imagine any other way one would break unless you stepped on it bent one severely or beat one to death they are made of the same type of plastic in which commercial cds are packaged i always prefer to buy this exact type and brand of case
but i love these cases i have had no problems with them yet they snap closed stay closed and are fairly sturdy granted i do not go throwing them around or anything but for organizing things and keeping the dust off these cases do a good enough job for me
i 've used these and similar cases for years no problems even with the cats occasionally knocking them around and walking on them 1 i 've never had one crack 2 they hold the disc securely but not with so much force that you risk damaging the disc when removing it 3 as long as you open them properly from the front clear side by pulling near the corner s while holding the back colored side they open fine
they are okay for eight or so dollars but they do n't last very long then again i used these for a digital camera so maybe that 's why they get drained so quickly however for the price i still would buy them again
price ca n't be beat i do n't see the difference between this battery and some of the more pricier ones i have two kids under two and these batteries are a life saver
i have used about half of these batterys mostly in clocks and different items around the house but also i used them in the flash for my camera and they held up real good i have a lot of rechargeable batterys but these are better because they last a lot longer often the rechargeable batterys only last for a few months if that long alkaline batteries for me can last for up to a year and longer if amazon went back to free shipping on these then i would buy them up and give them to friends as a gift or a prize i do not know what the shipping is but it may still be worthwhile i just know so far these batteries have held up real good and i would highly recommend them
excellent value these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price if you use a lot of aa 's this is the way to go made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the 18 range
i bought three boxes of these and have had great success with them i ca n't tell the difference between these and duracell 's or energizers very pleased with my purchase i will buy some more
a ton of batteries for cheap they work great always good to have bulk stock on batteries pleased with how many come in pkg
nothing great do n't expect to have and high drain but if you want a bunch for use in all the kids ' toys clocks alarms good dea
it is pretty cheap stuff i did not expect excellent quality however in my speedlite 420 it works excellently and supposed to provide more than 300 flashes with a focal length average of 70
my daughter uses a cochlear implant that has the option of being powered by 3 aa batteries we have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest we have tried energizer duracell etc she needs to replace them every day and a half since the implant is a high power draining device every extra hour counts these batteries are one of the best values out there
i bought the for two purposes the first is to provide battery backup power for my home computer system on a daily basis the second is to use with my portable generator to provide clean power '' to all of my electronics when the power goes out and i 'm forced to use it the handles both situations very well the provided powerchute software installed without a problem and managed the computer system perfectly when the power went out completing a graceful shutdown when the battery got low apc only provides the most basic version of their software you have the option of buying an upgraded one it does n't have any reporting or testing features but given the size of the i do n't see why you would care this is a ups for workstations and small electronic not servers so i do n't see the need for robust ups software the ups hooks up via a provided usb cable and the setup was very easy the provide about 11 minutes of run time for my system which is comprised of a computer lcd monitor wireless router and dsl modem as for using the ups with the generator i have n't had any problems so far the generator maufacturer recommmends using at least a surge supressor with their product but i figured a ups would be one step better i would definitely recommend this unit
i own 3 compact flash cards by viking and bought them in this order and recently i have never had any problems with any of these cards and have always looked for viking compact flash cards whenever i needed any this card works perfectly with my ipaq pocket pc storing a variety of files from to mpeg video to word excel and maps for my pocket pc gps system i did try a lexar card once and found it did not work with my pocket pc as well as this one as not all the files on it were recognised i will always buy viking compact flash
i 've used viking compactflash cards in digital cameras for years and have had a problem with of them never a glitch every bit has always come through perfectly and i did have a glitch with a cf card of leading brand s '' i do not own this particular viking card but i 've owned and viking cf cards and used them in 3 different canon cameras as far as i know this cf cards uses the same technology as at least the card i use all the time all that said standard viking cf cards are '' write speed about write speed that is slower than many other cf cards that may be an issue for digicams with limited image buffers but i 've never found that to be a problem in digital slrs with large write buffers the camera continues to shoot more photos while the viking card finishes writing to the cf card for the price the vikings have been winners '' in my book a previous reviewer commented about difficulties with viking customer service i have to wonder what the problem was that he experienced with the that let him to call viking 's customer service in the first place was it anything serious or did he just have a question he never said not that the cust svc comments he quoted are excusable if true but they 're so outrageous that they 're a little hard to believe
batteries have quite a long life and recharging takes one hour
for the money this charger is a great deal it charges the batteries fully in a short time and comes with a car charger
works the batteries do get hot by the end of the charging period and it takes about 15 min to let them cool down by themselves i do n't know how long they would last if charged so quick but so far they look fine and the price of similar batteries is cheap this is not an extremely smart '' charger special wave cycle etc but it works
this charger is easy to use and you know when the charge is full and complete it also charges three aaa as well as double aa you can also use the two center charging terminals to charge two 3 aaa or two double aa batteries the price is also good as well as the shipping charge the four 2400 batteries seem to last much longer than the 2000 batteries cwje
i have not had coverage for this apple product however i had a washing machine covered by them the washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off throughout was great and made every effort to fix the machine when the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that i paid for it they did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that i actually had the machine
i like it works nice this mouse is small comfortable on the hands
very easy to use comfortable size i would recommend this product if you do n't need advanced bells and whistles ''
upon buying my notebook computer i immediately purchased this mouse the touch pad on the laptop is sufficient for basic navigation but for heavy use especially web browsing an external mouse is a must the mouse has an usb adapter that clips on the bottom of the mouse for convenient storage when not in use mouse works fine even several feet away from laptop the curved buttons that fit your fingers make using this mouse very comfortable to use for long periods of time i highly recommend this devise for greater laptop productivity enjoyment
a great mouse ! perfect size nice features simply plug it in and it starts working ! seems to be well made to install the battery you have to push in the silver logo button on the back end of the mouse really hard then the casing top pops off however for some reason at least on my hp when this is plugged in the screensaver will not come on if left there i need to unplug it if i 'm gon na be gone for awhile i love this winter blue color i 'm so glad that i chose it i have only had this for a couple months but it works fantastically i just hope it lasts as long for me as some of the other reviewers have said it lasted for them
use this mouse every day for over 2 months i 've never had to reset it and i find it to be very accurate battery life seems to be great as well have n't changed mine yet travels really well with the usb receiver mounting on the bottom of the mouse highly recommended
this little thing works ! the read and write speed are fast i 'm very happy with it
bought this to make use of all the spare sd cards i have around the house it is fantastic it fits in to my laptop 's usb port and all the computers at work the largest card i have used was a 1.0 gb card the speed of the card reader seems to be dependent on the quality on of the sd card
this is a super media card perfect for storing and transfering lots of extra pictures
esaki si ta campion un tremendo idea di e sistema pa por load up un potret digital ariba bo pc hopi bon y facil esaki ta pone cu bo por saca bo potret digital y pone ariba bo pc via e systema aki di chip tremendo
the convergence of electronics instead of spending in a memory card and a usb memory separetly you can use them both saving some money and space you also improve the video and picture downloading to any computer or xbox without cables of software installation
its very helpfull when you manage several sd cards its faster and very reliable !
i use it from 6 months with an microsd card and with my old reads and writes so fast and cheap wish it have an neck strap
i use this to read the card from my mobile phone with sd card adapter it works as expected but seems to have higher throughput the flash card than my desktop card reader i bought it on someone else 's recommendation to begin with very satisfied
this is a very good product and you can get it along with any other products on amazon up to 500 free ! participate in this special promotion and get a free 500 amazon gift card at this web site
it came comp with the purchase of a kodak dig camera what can i say it can hold a bunch of pictures i rated it a 4 only because i have nothing to compare it to
we needed an extra card right away and were happy that we paid for the fastest overnight delivery option the card came in time and we used the card extensively on our trip to australia
i am pleased with the card i was not at all pleased with the '' website that promised i could upgrade the size but kept refusing to lrt me
i would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again timely delivery and exactly what i saw on the website
bought this charger through amazon when we lost the charger that came with our canon digital rebel xt this seemed like a good option at a good price and it has proven to be so i actually prefer this to the canon charger which always felt like more of a travel charger to me this one can sit on my desk and i do n't have to get down on floor to get the battery it also includes a car adapter and foreign power adapter nice extras to me this is the right charger to have around the house even if you have the canon charger bring that one on your vacations since it packs up nice and small with the caveat that it 's easy to forget in a hotel or something get an extra battery when you get this charger too so you can always have a charged up battery ready to go
this is a great purchase i 'm very happy with the performance quality and time to charge
they last and last but get two pairs so you have some spares need to recharge every week whether or not you use them a great product
i have been using a minolta digital camera the batteries that came with it were only 1600 mamps i never got through an entire ballgame without having the batteries run dry of course i carried a spare set but this was less than ideal i got these 2000 mamp monsters and i must say they deliver what they promise as a result i 've really not needed the backup set even when shooting games that went into extra innings ! the charger is well made very quick and has easy leds to see the charge status from across the room overall this has been a great purchase
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
lowepro offers consistently products and this sliplock pouch is no exception it is secure and well padded i use it to hold a garmin gps receiver but you could easily use it for a small digital camera or other accessory it is a bit deep for the smallest cameras which might tend to get lost in the bottom of the pouch although you could put additional items like spare batteries underneath to raise them up the main pouch has a design for good security a drawstring closure is covered by the main flap with a velcro seal a front mesh pocket is a good place to store small things like spare aa batteries or in my case an external antenna for the gps a cleverly designed sealed belt loop allows you to easily and securely attach the pouch to your belt or the of a backpack without having to remove your belt two on the sides also give you the options of using it with a shoulder strap note the photo of this pouch has recently been changed and no longer looks like the pouch i reviewed i do n't know whether it is an error in the photo or whether amazon has used the same description for a completely unrelated product note correct photo has been added again
even after reading all the reviews on this product i was still amazed at the sound quality and loudness this little speaker set offers perfect for traveling camping parks etc i would buy it again ! oh also comes with a set of plug adapters to use in other countries and also a pair of nice earbuds
first of all these are good speakers nice design but it has one flaw batteries it eats them up fast if you use batteries instead of the wall plug in it comes with it wont go as loud and if it thinks your playing it to loud it will or something of the sort but it has good sound quality and honeslty when your on the go when do you really need it blasting also they are large enough that you cant put them in large jean pockets sadly but it doesnt weigh much at all and i really like how if i ever my ipod somehow it has a cd player walkman so they wont become useless if i lose the ipod the wall hook up also comes with many different adapters
amazing sound with surprising light and portable i invited a group of friends over and they counld belive the sound coming from this small unit
i was replacing a portable sony devise that i really liked but busted one of the speakers this is a very attractive unit with excellent sound i can even plug in my mini disc player it is very portable with a nice black bag i was very pleased at the sound of this small unit includes earphones an adapter to play other devises besides ipods and universal outlet powers up the ipod while playing also runs on 4 aa batteries ''
i purchased these speakers in order to be able to have some music on an upcoming vacation and boy was i happy the speakers fold up into a very compact size and even come with it 's own case the extra adapter plugs allowed us to it in french polynesia to charge our ipod and since the speakers work with 220 voltage i did not even have to get a converter outside of the hotel room we used batteries for power without any problems most importantly the sound quality is great ! ! !
i am a graduate student in linguistics working with an indigenous language in oaxaca i brought this speaker set to mexico with me this year as a replacement for a bulky panasonic cassette transcriber it worked like a dream instead of using cassettes for transcription we used recorded on an edirol digital recorder instead of a transcriber we used a laptop with windows media player and these altec lansing speakers the sound quality was perfect for transcription and the whole package was lighter and easier to manage than a transcriber in my down time i got to listen to music ca n't beat that
worked great for my ipod unpacked plug in put my ipod in press play and i was good to go using it in a 12 x 12 office at low listening volume and find it to be just fine
very pleased compact easy to move from place to place
this review is a little but i am going to share with you my experiences after burning hundreds of dvds after all many of us are archiving data video we will want to be able to access for decades into the future and currently there are no other reviews for this product on the site i have used just about every type of recordable dvd media available and have concluded fuji offers the best value i recommend you stick with the fuji made in japan this is important since there are multiple manufacturers who make recordable dvds for fuji not uncommon in the industry for the end user the dvds from the different manufacturers all under the fuji name look nearly identical you might want to take the time to google and then download a free utility program named dvd identifier you simply put your recordable dvd into your computer 's dvd writer and dvd identifier will tell you who actually manufactured the dvd many of you might be surprised the brand name on the disc and the actual manufacturer are often different for example the fuji dvds made in japan are made by taiyo yuden one of if not the most reputable manufacturers out there the fuji dvds made in taiwan are made by an entirely different manufacturer both the japan and taiwan fuji dvds look nearly identical in packaging and share a common proof of purchase code however one set will note made in japan under the proof of purchase code and the other set will note made in taiwan under the proof of purchase code the other way to distinguish between the packages is the made in japan dvds will have the plastic spindle cover flush against the black spindle base the made in taiwan dvds will have the black base stick out slightly i have heard some people say digital is digital and all dvds are created equal this is not true you want to buy a dvd that is manufactured with quality you might save a few cents buying a cheaper dvd however you have to factor in bad burns and lost data with the cheapo dvds you will have more coasters and more dvds that initially burn fine but lose the data after a few months in the past two years i have burned over of the made in japan fuji dvds and have only six bad burns and have not yet experienced lost data from any of the hundreds of successful recordings i use these fuji dvds more than any other brand i also use the panasonic also manufactured by taiyo yuden as well as unlabeled dvds from an online wholesaler that are also manufactured by taiyo yuden the fuji dvds have an attractive silver color top the panasonics have an attractive gold color top the panasonic dvds are also much more expensive than the fujis in terms of compatibility i have played the fuji dvds on over 20 different dvd players and have yet to find a player that does not play my video recorded on a fuji dvd the 50 pack fuji spindle regularly goes on sale for 20 at a variety of retailers
like the other reviewer i also have a nec dvd drive i 've tried sony memorex verbatim maxell and tdx discs but none compare to fuji i 've also tried generic ones but was every time i got another unintended frisbee one brand in particular mentioned earlier would not hold '' what i wrote on the disc on the first day the disc was fine go back to it in a month the data is gone ! the others would burn fine but more times than not the quality of the picture would be downgraded the video skiped jumps etc and yes i thought so too but nope it happened on more than 5 dvds i tested thank goodness i found these at the store on sale ! what the heck i 'll give it a try ca n't get much worse i got ta say fuji is all i use now i have n't even gotten 1 coaster and i 'm on my 100 pack ! i archive movie and picture files and the picture quality is as good as the first day i highly recommend these ! spend a little more and get the quality and longevity you 'd expect from writing on your dvds do n't risk seeing your data one day gone the next
i got this for free after rebates when i bought drive last xmas time i started using these very recently 15 days back or so i have burned about 25 dvds so far and all of them came perfect not a single item is wasted etc may be some of the credit goes to nec drive i am very happy with it so i got another 50 pack from local fry 's for about 20.00
it has restored every disc i put into it that includes dvds cds and games it takes exactly 1 minute to restore a disc and it 's much better than the versions what more can i say except buy this pruduct
i had one cd in 2500 training set that would not read the scratches were deep enough to be felt with the finger after running the disc through the skip dr it read just like ne
this is a very good product ! instructions are very clear and easy to follow i was able to repair 6 cds with minor scratches
i 've used this to repair several music cds and a couple of dvds with 100 success it 's easy and fast to use i love it and it 's saved me easily 50 because i have n't had to replace cds or dvds
i bought this to clean up all of my kids dvds they have a ton of discs that are dirty scratched etc i have cleaned over 30 discs so far and have fixed all but one it was scratched up i am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since i have considered this one of my smartest buys this year
first off i do n't give 5 's for anything if you expect this remote to be able to duplicate your other remotes based on a predetermined code for the manufacturer of your equipment it wo n't happen it works for some but not all and did n't recognize most of mine correctly however it has the ability through computer hookup to learn all of the functions that any of your remotes have takes some practice and bravado but will work my wife loves it and wo n't let me put the multiple remotes back on the coffee table if you are computer literate this thing is amazing the two downsides are 1 it is heavy you 're not likely to hold it in one hand while lying on the couch and flipping around it pretty much has to sit on a table 2 the keys that appear on the screen can not be renamed so if a key name does n't match one on your remote you 'll have to remember what you programed the key to do
this remote does its job well i had eight remotes to control the gear in my living room and this thing took the place of all of them i no longer lose them in the couch or forget where i put them last and it no longer takes me five minutes to set up just to watch a movie or listen to music macros allow one button press to turn on or off all required equipment and set them to the correct mode the backlight is pleasant i like the audio feedback of button presses and the sheer size of the thing feels good in my hands and prevents misplacement that being said this thing was a royal pain to get working properly right out of the box this may be because i have some less mainstream equipment but the previous reviews do not exaggerate the pc program interface with its endless mouse clicking even the wizard '' has multiple mouse clicks for one simple button which can get very tedious if you have a remote with 40 buttons on it like for a reciever here 's a recommendation skip through the initial wizard as fast as you can then make a new profile and start out in advanced mode even if you go through the wizard most of your time will probably be spent in advanced mode anyway because you have to tweak alot buttons to get them working this may save you much time and headache this is also where you program macros the shining star of this remote software installation is straightforward the interface aside from the points mentioned above is relatively simple you can drag and drop components to pick the order you want them to show up on the screen everything is clearly labelled and easy to read macros are simple too but only after you get the buttons working properly it took me a couple of hours to get it to do all dish network remote commands after manually programming each button for the dvr i had to make a macro to get to my recordings '' with one button press and it took a few tries to get it to do page up and page down when browsing the guide the remote itself has a nice finish and weighs about like a largish paperback book in your hands the touchscreen is large enough to poke at it without worrying about hitting the wrong button the physical buttons are responsive and do not feel cheap or clicky '' after some use fingerprints show up on the touchscreen especially when eating popcorn however the display is bright enough when backlit that they are n't really a distraction the menu tree is easy to learn and get used to as well this remote would get five stars if it were n't for the subpar pc interface and sparse documentation the actual remote is fantastic however and well worth the time and effort it takes to get it up and running just make sure you burn a cd with a copy of your profile once you get it going !
initial setup could be complex for some but considering all it is capable of i 'd say it 's worth the time investment
my husband told me he would like a sony home theater remote control for father 's day as father 's day approached i realized i could n't remember what it was he 'd asked for so i asked him again i was nearly out of time to locate this product but i checked and they had them listed i ordered one and had it shipped quickly but i did n't think it would be in time for him to open on father 's day the package arrived on saturday the day before father 's day and amazon saved the day for me thank you amazon for all that you do ! kathryn
i ordered the simpletech cf for my canon digital rebel xt because the price was great and because i had read that simpletech made cards two weeks after placing my order with no word from simpletech and no tracking number i contacted simpletech via the amazon website i got a very prompt response explaining that they never received the order from amazon some technical glitch but to make it up to me they would refund my shipping charges and send the card overnight the card arrived as promised i put it in my camera and nothing i put it in a card reader and got an error i contacted simpletech tech support through their website and got a very prompt response saying that the card was dead and they would gladly replace it they sent me a ups shipping label for the return and a few days later i had a new card the new card works perfectly and although the fates conspired against me i would definitely recommend simpletech to anyone looking for an affordable product their customer service was extremely quick in responding and they replaced the defective card quickly and without hassle
this is a great card to use for your 8 megapixel digital camera i have the olympus and at the camera settings i can get 254 color shots from this card simpletech is my favorite brand because i 've never had any of their cards fail on me even after repeated washings oops this cf card is totally dependable simpletech is pricey but you 're paying for quality which is cheaper in the long run
i had a 512 simpletech card and loved it i got this card a week ago and it has worked great the 512 card was used very heavily for nearly 2 years and so i purchased from simpletech again the card maxs out the meter which suggests how many pictures i have remaining to take unless it is on the highest setting it says i can fit roughly 950 pictures from this camera on the highest settings but i have not been able to take that many yet ! batteries only last for 300 pictures so i probably do n't need a card this big it is nice for videos though and it can hold about minutes of video at it also seems to write very quickly much quicker than my lexar card for most users i would suggest having cards rather than do n't keep all your eggs in 1 basket
excellect price and fast read write works great in my canon digital slr
i purchased this card for a canon digital camera primarily because canon sells this card at their website and because i read somewhere that simpletech makes the cards that come with some canon digital cameras you can read about the card 's specifications elsewhere just let me say that this is my second simpletech card i also have a 256 mb sd card that i use in a hp calculator and both cards work as well as advertised i will definitely buy from simpletech again
the advantage of this surge strip is that there is a 2 outlet phone jack surge protector on board i actually had a modem blow out due to a surge and it came through the telephone line now i use a protector so i do n't have to unplug my phone when a storm is brewing note that most surge protectors baring the kind with huge capacitors can not protect against lightning hits but surges from power problems coming over the lines are common especially in summer and these devices can help
i got this stuff as a gift for a friend of mine he seems to be happy using it so i am giving this a 5 star
i have 4 of these to use with my ipac and also my player which they are full of all my music and are interchangeable with both units
its a great product and so compatibly i tried several places before buying this product and as well all the items i buy amazon is a good place to try their prices are 90 lower what you can find elsewhere
if a disk works and gives me a clear picture and clear sound it is all that i ask for for the size of the disk compared to the price i just do n't know how you could beat this product in my opinion sandisk is one of the best never have had a problem with the sandisk brand
the one gig sd card works better than i thougt it would it is by far the cheapest one i 've ever found and i 'll probably get another one soon fyi i use the card in my nikon digital camera with the pics set to 6 megapixals and using the uncompressed format approx 1.8 meg ea i have 190 pics and 10 short 1 min movies and the card is about 80 percent full that is awesome
it was really cheap the cheapes around also it works fine no complaints but it looks a little weird the packaging and the sticker on the card maybe a nock off since it says made in china but it works none the less
i use this storage card in my canon sd 600. get 968 mb of useable space on my camera a card is necessary for people who want to take lots of pictures and not fuss with downloading only complaint that these cards are still a little pricy and hope that it continues to come down in price
the product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what i wanted i have not yet been able to fill up the memory with my camera but will try to soon
working perfect amazing the amount of space in pictures you can have ! ! great product more than enoug
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
so far i have been very pleased with these batteries my last digital camera had it 's own battery and held a charge for a very long time these batteries have met or surpassed my expectations
i bought these batteries along with the sony worldwide battery charger with 4 aa nimh batteries exellent charger excellent batteries a real money saver
i use them for wireless devices and digital cameras with the sony charger they are excellent much better than the rechargable canon batterie
just wanted to echo what others have said that these batteries seem to really last i received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it almost as powerful as the here and the batteries ran out after a few hours replaced those batteries with these and these just seem to last on and on am very happy with them
i bought these for my sony digital camera and i am very pleased with them exact fit into the camera and with great capacity they simply seems to last forever so running out of power is no longer an issue for me the sliding case is a nice touch for storing and transporting your batteries highly recommended
these batteries are far stable and durable in long term use i have owned name and kodak rechargeable batteries they are either unstable voltage output or die out much earlier than their publicized sometimes one in pair die out then other remains not sony i ca n't use them for the digital camera power source because it requires delicate and stable voltage supply those sony batteries seemed not to go down voltage levels and when their charge are drained the pair 2 batteries go down together it 's perfect use for an equipment that needs constant and stable power supply like digital camera
this was the best deal i found on rechargable nihm batteries and that too these are made in japan by sony it has a capacity of i do not think it gets any better than this i would suggest anyone looking out for good nimh batteries to go ahead and buy these
the reason i love this printer is because of its ease of use and that 's due to it 's number one feature tv output i 've had a tendency in the past to neglect photo printing because once i get our pictures onto my computer i want to fiddle with them endlessly to improve '' them before i print them out in the end i never do get around to it now we 'll come home from a day of photo shooting look at our pics on the tv and print out the good ones then i can touch up the photos that need it at my leisure and if i am too lazy to even do that it 's simple enough for someone else to take over meaning it 's much more likely to get done it was great coming back from a hawaiian vacation with my family and printing out pictures that day for them to take home ! this printer does n't get 5 stars because of photo quality cost of goods you can get the printing packs for half a buck per photo but professional printing will cost less the photos from pros will usually look better too while this is a dye sublimation printer it only uses three colors of ink so better inkjets and professional prints will have better colors than this machine based purely on tech specs this one should beat out most of the cheaper inkjets including other stand alone photo printers in the same price range but i have n't seen any comparisons on the plus side the sony does print '' a transparent layer over the picture that 'll keep it from fading for quite a while as for my personal opinion of the printouts as a casual pic taker with a canon i would give them an the colors could be a bit more vibrant but i have also been surprised by just how much they will pop in a good pic ultimately however i feel that the convenience of having everyone sitting on the couch and picking out the photos they want through the television means the minor issue becomes inconsequential because without that convenience those pictures might never see the light of day in any form overall i would recommend this unit to friends who do casual printing and want something that is very simple to use i 've even considered sending one to my mother for christmas while the interface as a whole is perhaps not quite as intuitive to use as an ipod anyone who is n't scared by a cellphone or basic computer use should be able to handle it easily it 's also flexible taking a variety of card formats and providing different options for choosing the pictures you want to print though i would be surprised if you ever used anything but the tv out and ultimately i think that anyone who gets it will be printing more photos than before finally a couple of notes for those who decide to take the plunge do n't count on finding the paper easily i have n't seen it anywhere all of the paper is postcard paper '' i was a bit confused at first looking for normal '' packs the paper has edges on the left and right it 's so you wont get any rough edges but it 's a bit of a pain to tear off without fingerprinting '' or creasing the photo enjoy
i just received my printer tonight and could not wait to try it out i have had a sony digital camera for over two years and have only been able to print pictures via my regular inkjet printer i decided to purchase this photo printer so i could get much clearer better quality pictures i love that this printer allows you to print from a memory stick without having to connect the printer to your computer it could not be easier just insert the memory stick in the printer and you are set to go it was extremely easy to set up and it comes with trial paper and ink i have only used it to print out 6 pictures but thus far i am very happy with my purchase the photo 's are extremely clear they look like i took them to a high quality lab to have them developed
this printer is wonderful and the picture quality is superb and they are so clear i have a cybershot camera and the combination is nice the printer speed was quick too ! i could n't believe how easy it was to connect the printer to the tv and view the pictures that i had stored on my camera and edit the pictures using a remote control i would recommend this printer because of the easy setup quick printing speed and excellent quality of the pictures
it is very small but comfortable to use i do n't have really big hands so i do n't know how a man would feel i hate the touch mouse on the notebook computer so this is great for me it helps me do things much faster
this mouse is great for laptop use on the go it comes with me everyday on the train and on buses on my way to work and still works with no problems after a couple of drops and banging into things my only complaint is the dimensions on this page are way off the mouse is very small for my hands i basically use it with 2 fingers but it works great !
i was surprised how tough these little critters are i got it initially because i did some travelling and needed something small and light my 2 boys 3 and 5 started using it because it fits their hands to play games and i was n't sure how long it was going to last and they can be very rough with it you know little kids when they get excited or frustrated with computer games ! to my surprised its been nearly a year and it is still alive and well and they used it most every day ! i bought my wife one and she loves it and i ended up getting an extra one for myself for travel purposes yes it may be a little small for my hand but not totally uncomfortable and it does its job i even used it through one complete project
when travelling you want it small and light besides you need it to be precise and comfortable all these features come with this handy or fingery ! mouse you wo n't regret it
i 've had it for over a month now and it works as well as i expected it to work i was expecting random quirks here and there as i continued using it but none whatsoever
i 'm a grad student and use a laptop every day at school i got this little mouse at staples over 2 years ago and it is still going strong ! it is very compact and fits easily into my accessory pouch you ca n't go wrong with this one
order this to try and save on money since i didnt need a whole lot of outlets i pluged my computer to it and tv on a full battery it was able to run for about with my 32 ' crt tv and 19 ' lcd monitor comp good enough for me to power down the computer would last longer if the tv was off im sure
i shot several hundred pictures at a wedding with a battery grip and 2 of these batteries and did not have a single problem with power
i have had mine for over 2 years im a painter i work with lots of loud machines all day from my paint sprayer to the sander these buds are very good they are comfortable enough to wear all day i generaly work hrs a day and use them for at lest hrs they have one of the best sounds i have had out of a headphone i bought some boss ear buds a while back and that were over 100.00 but the sound difference was not worth the extra cash i forked out the long cord can be anoying ive just learned to cary a small ruberband with me and tuck the extra into the pocket with my if you wear the headpones with the wire behind your head it dosnt bother you at all i dont know what people are saying about the wires rubbing and making noise mine dont you should buy them save yourself some cash
i 've had a pair of 's for over a year and the sound is great the bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles however it is just right for me i find the midrange and treble to be appropriate i have a pair of grado headphones and a pair of sony headphones each is a 100 conventional set of headphones and yet i actually prefer the sound of the sony earbuds the only problem i have is that the cord is far too short without the extension and far too long with the extension a free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones what were they thinking also the fact that the right ear 's cord is so much longer than the left 's is ridiculous do n't they have a focus group review these things
i was pleased with the price happy with the time of delivery and so far have had no issues with the quality of these headphones the sound quality is good on airplanes when working out and they do not fall out of my ears nor do they cause any discomfort
like i said above i am on my second pair of these the first pair made it over two years of daily 5 mile workouts on an eliptical crosstrainer believe me they held up well considring they got sweat soaked almost every day of their life these phones really bring out the bass beat and are for the money some of the best sounding headphones on the market when this pair wears out i will get some more they are light years ahead of the cheap foam covered earbuds in sound and comfort you do n't even realise you are wearing headphones with these on
these are great earbuds i have alswys used sony dj headphones in the past and these are the first pair of buds i have purchased i am impressed for the money the sound quality is very good full and well rounded with good bass and the treble is not too bright they are pretty comfortable in the ears but it does take a little getting used to the cord is rather thin and very flexible but seems to be sturdy enough for most use the included 'case ' is a little tough to figure out but could be good for keeping them clean in a purse or backpack definitely recommended
i recently purchased an alienware computer with a dell 30 '' monitor and wanted speakers to match i wanted very loud speakers to shake the walls when i play games or watch dvd 's these speakers are the loudest i have tried the shake the walls and house with great sound some important pro '' features i really like the speaker cables are clips rather than rca plug in other words i can use my own speaker cable i need long ones to route the surround speakers to make it a professional installation all wires hidden each speaker volume is adjustable because of my room size i manually turned up the surround speakers volume to balance the sound coming from the front the remote is really cool to adjust volume quickly just point and turn it up
these speakers pump ! they sound great and can be used for almost anything since they accept multiple input sources the subwoofer is huge though make sure you have space for it
you really ca n't go wrong with this one not great response but what do you expect for less than 300 on the other hand the possibilities for this surround system are endless want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system this is how my daughter has it configured it 's our second one first one died as a result of recent electrical storm yes the circuit was 'protected ' but so what could n't be happier for the investment
the logitech speaker set is one of the best deals around you get all of the features and benefits of a dolby digital decoder true sourround sound and a digital control unit sound is you may find that tweaking the equalizer settings on your media card will greatly improve and balance the sounds output the best part it can play loud too ! cranking it up to its full potential produces deep rich pounding bass without even making the amplifier 's heat sink very hot to the touch ! a best buy !
this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers but these speakers are n't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews i had a bose companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these but they do lack base and loudness but overall i am pretty satisfied with these
these speakers are the best speakers i have ever heard well balanced between power and clarity i recommend logitechs
i am using this system instead of component audio to do with my new hi def tv i ca n't believe the quality of sound that comes out i would have paid what this system cost to buy it in pieces and the sound would be roughly the same i would recommend these for whatever use you have they rock literally
after going through more than ten different manufactures of media i have to say i have had the best results with these close to 100 burn rate with excellent playback on most players except sony though i 'm using a sony burner one batch had some duds at the end of the cake and amazon replaced the whole thing promptly
have n't used any of these yet but i wo n't trust any other brand of dvd than verbatim
my current dvd writer nec i also use memorex media zero i have one gigabyte of ram inside my computer corsair makes the ram
i rarely write reviews but i could not believe what i saw with the 24 dvd '' players and it does n't work all i ever use are verbatim dvd 's and i burn on both a mac and a unit the windows dvd 's play fine in my mac and also i have two sony dvd players a and my roomies zenith dvd player none of which have a problem playing the discs if you truly '' had problems with 24 dvd players i am wondering if you just got a bad disc i have been burning copies of my older dvd 's this weekend alone having done 7 with not a coaster on my 50 pack in under a month and only have had one problem which was my fault anyhow verbatim 's in my opinion are the best media available in both and dvd dl
when i first got my sony dvd burner i had numerous failure with burns i tried several different brands of blanks with the same problem big stacks of failed burns when i called sony to complain they suggested i use verbatim i did and in at least 150 burns i have no failures so naturally i 'm hooked on verbatim it must be the best
i rarely write a review but i figure i should on this one first off the price was perfect for 100 dvd blanks next the quality of the blanks for burning backups of dvds i have worked fantastic although finding the right software to do the deed is tricky at first anyhow i also had to clean house on a 30 gig drive and a laptop so the file transfer worked fine to the dvd 's my only problem was with the shipment itself it came in some square box i opened the box to find some paperbags wrapped around a broken dvd container with the blanks barely hanging on the plastic that incased them was totally shreded and broken go figure ! they need to work on their shipping skills try bubble wrap next time boys and not paper sacks other than that i just needed to burn backups of dvds and get files to dvds so the item itself worked pro i highly recommend i do n't blame verbatim for the shipping issues go for it
thats right not even a single coaster as many others said i did have one but that was 'coz of some other reason there was no problem with these discs i have burnt about 80 of these no probs so far cheer
verbatim is great not a single coaster till now in abt 60 discs i use nero to perfectly complement the burning process i was sceptic when i did geta great deal ar heard from ppl saying these could be from a different production line excellent discs would definitely go for em was always a believer in ritek ridata before these got to get some of those rws
i find the verbatim media blanks to be an excellent are compatible with a large number of computer burners and home dvd recorders that use these you burn your home movies or data files they are there to stay highly recommended and inexpensive
this wheel does the job it 's not super fancy but you still get the driving experience enjoy
i bought this for my kids to use with nascar racing controls are easily reprogramable nice product for the money
dear seller the price was good the product was good your delivery was excellent ! but it did not come with even a sample of what it can do ! so what now i plugged it into my computer and everything loaded as it usually does but no games not even a starter edition pardon my ignorance but even when i registered with logitech there was no reference to an actual usuable and downloadable game for this device confused new gamer i bought this for my five year old who is as mystifyed as i am this product is not a recommend for the novice such as myself just go out and buy a complete system that has all the bits and pieces included time and disappointment
the relatively inexpensive logitech nascar wheel and pedals are analog a must for racing games like need for speed analog potentiometers slide along infinite voltage points between or right the wheel suction cups hold snugly for a standard desktop the pedals tend to slip slightly and may be at a slightly awkward angle but can easily be mounted to a small inexpensive piece of hardboard or plywood or car floormat you could also design a wood framework the try me '' wheel i returned was digital full or right as ineffective as using keyboard arrow keys
i purchased this product for my 3 yr old he loves it and it works with most of his computer games to my surprise it did not come with instructions so we 're having to self teach ourselves the features surprisingly i ca n't get the vibration feature to work with his nascar game and this is a nascar race wheel the vibration works for his spongebob game
i bought two of these wheels last month and i 'm about to order 2 more i 'm setting up a little company picnic racing rally i played midnight run ii windows with these wheels and did n't experience the force feedback either however when i played nascar 3 with these wheels then i got vibrations in the steering wheel when taking turns too tight but nothing when bumping the wall or another car the force feedback amounts to a 'humming ' vibration and is actually annoying btw there 's an option in nascar 3 you have to turn on for the force feedback to work the force feedback was just a 'nice ' feature for me but i really got it for the usb connection and table top design i have a couple of the interact racing wheels and their 'sit nestled between your legs ' design is awkward to deal with and it 's too tall to effectively use them on a table but the logitech wheels work great on a table top ! the logitech connectors are a little more reliable too the pin connector housing on the snapped off pretty easily on one of the wheels however i do prefer 's full size pedals to the logitech smaller pedals but it 's satisfactory
i have used these for over two years now and they work absolutely great i have burned movies games files everything have n't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the dvd players i tried them out on not much else to say
excellent flawless works great on my pc 's sony burner highly recommend no coasters yet
been using memeorex 's 's since and their 's since 2001. i have never had any issue with memeorex media so i never bother using anything else not one dvd coaster created with pioneer 's
these are the best 's on the market i have only had a handful of these not work out of the hundreds that i have used very stable and plays on most dvd players highly recomend ! ca n't beat the price
this unit set up great i am using it to backup my dvr and hdtv box these components wipe out various settings whenever there is the slightest power interruption this unit has served me well
i bought this belkin battery backup after a power failure disaster was narrowly averted by ms word 's autorecovery feature it 's worked fine at warding off power failures since i have n't really tested how well it does what it 's supposed to do i do have some comments on usability my wife finds the necessity to press and hold the power switch for several seconds i would like the backup outlets to be controlled by the switch so i could shut everything down for power conservation with one step
shipping took awhile but considering the weight of this item i still think it was excellent quick shipping service the price was excellent especially since i knew the model i needed beforehand and had priced it on other web sites too when i need to buy something i generally loook at amazon first now and seldom need to go any further
power ups ! everything you need to know first of all why do you want a power ups there are some very good reasons 1 you never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout 2 you want to work with clean power only 3 you want to monitor your pc power 4 you want to prevent your pc from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection the first rule about ups is to never trust the insurance claim get your pc insured elsewhere these companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims i have a pc running some very high specifications with over six usb devices lcd monitor printer and ethernet equipment with everything on at the same time i have never gone above of usage and average between and when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks even though i have a power supply unit psu i will be upgrading to a psu because it is better quality model the way i can monitor how many watts i use is with ups software and hardware so the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using the short answer to this is you do n't know until you install the ups and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time you need to estimate what it is i would say a domestic pc not a server would use max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on as soon as we add things like another pc or several printers or several monitors then we can start to overload a ups this brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any ups overloading and balancing the overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the ups capacity overloading does two things it can in theory eventually damage the ups and it voids the warranty most ups are but there are and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one pc setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups for a network so check the ups rating what ups you choose depends on how much you want to load on it next thing you need to check with the ups is if it comes with a usb connection if it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your pc and the ups comes with software now if the ups has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off ups sound alarms controlling how your ups handles a blackout how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation if it sounds an alarm or not if it run self tests data collection and monitoring notifications and sensitivity settings if the ups does not come with a usb connection and software then you probably should be looking for an ups designed for computer use rather than a ups for equipment most ups have led indicators that tell you the status of the unit the next thing to understand is that testing your ups is not done by breaking it out of the box connecting it to the mains plugging your pc in and then turning off the house 's power with the circuit breaker you must charge the ups first ! so read the instructions usually you must attach the battery to the ups plug it in firmly ! and wait before using it then perform the test using the software first ! then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the pc stays up usually a ups is programmed to shutdown your pc if the blackout lasts for a few seconds nearly all ups models with a usb connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the pc should hold for on the ups battery most ups devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem this is important because power surges on a ups that do not have this protection can damage a pc through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the pc somehow this is nasty problem with the degree of security that a ups can provide if it does n't have this function then it is not going to provide 100 surge protection with a pc that is networking a ups pc to another pc without ups can also increase the risk of surge protection problems it is not recommend that you network a ups pc to a pc unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue one last thing is that some ups have input regions on the ups for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot this is everything you need to know about an ups before you choose one it is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the ups and making sure it provides you with what you need the two top brands are apc and belkin
this appears to be a good piece of equipment i hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well
outlets are on top of case easy to plug in and change plug ins narrow case width allows backup unit to fit in the space available in my roll around computer cart switch is recessed and on front with lightup controls no bumping switch and shuting off accidentally
well ill have to keep this review short as its getting late this is actually the first tv that i have taken to write a review for its currently so my spelling might be a bit off alright enough of the pointless talk here is my review oh by the way the of this tv is out new color wheel its called the which has a new color wheel upon first reading about this tv i was a bit skeptical the whole the shell on the bottom of the screen when your seeing black on the scrren '' first of all you do see a little what looks like a white shell on the bottom of ths screen however is is barely noticable unless your trying to pick it out had my friend try to find something wrong with the screen when it was all black and he had problems finding the shell '' when i was buying a tv i needed one that was less the 40 '' in width because my wall unit is only 40 '' wide so i was looking at a lot of plasma 's and lcd 's but all of them were around '' because of the side mounted speakers this tv however was 39.3 '' wide which fit perfecly in the space at first i hooked up my to the system with my friend and booted it up the tv makes a chime sound which is a little catchy but not positive nor negitive in my opinion i get to the xbox screen set it for so i start playing a game and my first reaction was it looked like crap compared to my sony 60 '' wega tv after my friend left i was looking over at the xbox and figured out that the video cable was switched to edtv instead of hdtv when i switched it to hdtv i saw a huge differnce the picture was really really sharp and the tv is very bright which is good for movies and games i am really happy with the purchase of this tv and i would reccomend it to anyone that is looking for a good cheap tv pros looks amazing if you feed it a source very nice and bright if you want to play games or watch movies the interface is very clean and neat not importaint but i like it it is a very nice looking tv compared to some others i saw at bestbuy i like the speakers at the bottom of the tv it gives the screen a very clean and nice cut cons this tv brings out details from bad sources such as a standard dvd player i would just purchase a upconvert dvd player which outputs to and you will have a amazing picture the bulb will burn out in about years depending on use
i had similar problem with tv not turning on after having purchase a year ago for almost year it worked great ! ! tried all solutions given to me amazon was helpful with contact info it took about 2 weeks trying to get service when samsung could not fix problem it was resolved by offering to send me new replacement this years model i am completely satisfied with service
it 's a great buy the only problem that i have is the dnle '' wo n't stay on and no one can seem to tell me how to keep it on i get a sort of cloudy look but it 's tolerable other than that it 's great i 'm pleased
pros three customizable video profiles movies broadcast tv excellent brightness and contrast good viewing angles l r of center generous input options cons big centered button cries out for my toddler to turn it finally put a barbell in front of it the biggest con has not to do with the tv but the dearth of hd content others ' comments about broadcast tv looking horrible on hd sets can not be overemphasized same for dvds on sd dvd players on the latter note buy a good upcoverting dvd player 150 the visual results were simply outstanding also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum hdmi preferred using or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the tv so the other 'con ' is that you will probably need a new receiver and cables so to recap if you want a good experience you need an hd tv upconverting dvd player receiver with component or better yet hdmi connections and hd broadcast content cable or satellite this is not a cheap endeavor
the tv is really nice it works easily i have it hooked up to a cable network my friend also bought one about a week earlier and i liked hers so i ordered mine i would recommend it to anyone who wants a first class hdtv the service is quick and efficient the picture is fantastic
the service from amazon was great delivery people were most cooperative made delivery as promised placed tv in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out they even offered to take away the empty carton we saved about 250 by buying from amazon rather than from local retailer
wonderful picture quality in hd dvd displays well too standard cable signal not really much difference would recommend this tv to anyone just understand that you need hd programming for this tv to really shine the audio of this tv is ok nothing special but it gets the job done i have it hooked up to a surround sound and love it
i should first note that i am no expert on television sets and was more than a little confused by all the different technologies out on the marketplace after some research and a little help from a local home theater company i settled on this tv if 13 '' of depth is n't an issue for your application this tv offers picture quality on par with the more expensive plasmas and lcds could n't be happier with my purchase
great product for getting all those old home videos on dv
this little unit is easy to use and ready to go ! ! ! ! not one problem with it so far i 've been using it for over two months now
aa batteries sure come in handy around here we have seven battery operated clocks and all seven use aa 's we also have remote controls and a small radio plus other items that use aa 's now you see why i bought this 50 pack the expiration date on my 50 pack is december 2011 and i bought these batteries from amazon a few months ago for what i use these batteries for they are holding up great priced right too definitely worth it !
batteries made in china good for everyday use for 10 a good bu
wow 50 batteries for 9 bux is a deal ! and of course it lasts as long as a name brand battery if your going to use it for small devices cd player clock etc get sumthing else if your going to use these for a camera
how can you beat the price i bought this at from an awesome deal i found on
get them on sale they work just as well as the bigger name brands for a lot less money
i use these batteries when i need power immediately and i do n't have a set of rechargeables ready to go i also use them as backups so i do n't get caught without power and have to pay 1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores unfortunately my kids keep stealing them instead of recharging their own set
excellent sound system reminds you of being in a movie theatre great great system
if you want a budget home theater system for under 200 there is probably not many systems better then the sony this system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room considering the price sound quality is actually better then expected for me the tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity they may look like cheap computer speakers but they are n't and are a bit heavier then they look the center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low the surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though if set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin they are fixed and ca n't be replaced also if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you the 8 '' subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system it is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under 200 it is n't powered is very light only 9 lbs and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass the volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls the receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs it should be enough in most cases an extra digtal input or two would n't hurt but again the system is under 200 setup could n't be easier you just hook up the included microphone place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote the system will automatically sets up the speaker distance delay and volume levels the receiver comes with the basic pro logic ii music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources it also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they do n't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all basically if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under 200 then there is n't much better then the sony
i purchased this item recently and it 's excellent in all aspects it took me less than a hour to set it up and the super cool auto calibration takes cares of calibrating the speakers without having the pain of doing it manually the subwoofer delivers a meaty bass and the surround speakers are very impressive the centre channel could have been powered up a bit more so that it can deliver the movie dialogues in depth but still it does a good job overall i would say it 's an excellent choice when you compare the cost vs performance
i use them on ilo dvd recorder and also for recording home movies or data disk i have not had a problem with any of them ever i love them ! plus a great price !
i think those who are complaining have broken drives or computers i have been using these for about a year with zero defects
i use sonic burner program and these discs have worked perfectly fine good quality and quantity perfectly satisfied with this product
i see a lot of negative reviews here but i 've been using these discs for a couple months now with my powerbook 's superdrive and i 've had no problems at least none that i would attribute to the discs themselves one review laments toast titanium 7 which in my experience is a very finnicky buggy program i too had a number of failed burns with that program but i was able to remedy the situation by saving my dvd projects as disc images and then burning them later with disc utility after i had a chance to mount them and check them out for the price i payed for these discs if i remember right almost half the price of a 25 pack from other companies for a 50 pack from memorex i am very very pleased if you 're looking to play around with dvd burning and i guarantee you you will make a few mistakes and have to throw away a few discs before you get it right this is the best deal you 'll find anywhere
these dvd 's are really good i have yet to have any
i 've had this drive for a year now and i 've burned over 500 dvds the drive is still going strong with no signs of giving up i 've had a total of 4 coasters and they 've always been the fault of the blank dvds not the drive itself never had compatibility problems with dvds or cds and i 've even used some overseas memorex tdk fujifilm sony you name it and i 've burned it if you 're looking for a dependable good performance cheap drive look no further
the burner works well except when burning dual layer discs i have colleagues that also have this problem with dual layer discs when using other burners so it 's most likely a problem in nero and not the drive
all this has been said before but here it is again sony 's with accucore '' will burn at tdk will only burn at wherever you buy this buy it oem save the money for a better version of nero burning rom bundled retail software is junk i 've had mine for months now and burned most every format on dvds and cd 's no coasters it 's quite but you can here it run it has a busy light if it 's on it 's busy firmware updates for media are readily available present version is you can buy this under 50 and it works great with my amd and windows
very easy to install i 'm not very hardware literate i have used it to copy music with the and movies with so far no coasters it has done more than i expected and no problems my only complaint is it does n't have light scribe like the european models highly reccomend this to anyone looking to upgrade their computer
i bought this burner for around 40 i needed to add this for my system which didnot have the dvd burner part and also needed to backup my information this is easy to install if you are going to have two drives running then you need to set up one drive as master and the other drive as slave the white ide cable that is allready present in your system usually has this labels usually the top end of the ide white cable is the master and the middle point is the slave now also connect another power point at the same end as your previous drive and you are ready to roll if your computer doesnot recognise either of the drives then you need to change the jumper settings at the very back of your drive by the side of the ide cable slot you have another small slot whith three pairs of pins one end of them is covered with a black clip like jumper you need to change it to the other end and then restart your comp please donot forget to turn the power off now about this burner this is an amazing piece which burns dvds really silently it comes with nero 6 software which is easy to use i didnot need any upgrades of the software the older version works fine for me the reason i have given it 4 stars only is because it makes a funny noise when it reads my dvds funny looking at how silent it is when it burns them it also will read dvds that have scratches and other drives wont recognise all in all this is a very good buy for the price if it is to be your second drive and hey it is a nec so dont worry update 6 months later this nec burner works very well and is very silent when burning the dvds infact so silent that initially i wasnt sure if it was actually burning the dvds i would recommend nero software for this burner all in all a solid buy for the price and performance
i bought this dvd burner because my friends all told me that it was a great burner and i compared it to other specs of dvd burners without breaking the bank and by far this burner was the cheapest and was the fastest of all the cheaper burners i could find i can burn a full dvd in 40 minutes 30 minutes spent reading the disc and 10 actually writing it it works great with my memorex 's i loved this burner so much that i bought another one so i now have two burners in my computer i highly recommend this burner and the nero software that comes with it is great
i do n't know much about audio nor do i have a good basis for comparison but fwiw the system works fine and sounds good
we were very pleased with the system it arrived on time it was a present and we found it easy to use and good value for the price
i 've owned many sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality lots of hardy walkmen useful shortwave and portable radios stylish tvs and high quality cassette recorders i still have a sony mini component stereo model made in japan which i bought in 1992 for us but rather than pay to fix its cd player i decided to purchase this new sony component stereo made in china pluses decent sound good functionality easy and intuitive operation simple remote but only covers basic functions cons very short speaker leads unattractive styling for my tastes resembles a boombox only holds 3 cds vs 5 for comparable panasonic units at first glance i was disappointed by the cheap construction skimpy manual and very short speaker leads the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies but then i thought in 2006 for 150 i ca n't expect the same quality as i received in 1992 for 400 everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in china so for the money it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom the real test will be how long the cd changer works to be safe this time i bought the 2 year replacement warranty i have n't blasted it at full volume but it seems to have plenty of power when needed i originally bought a 300 panasonic unit sd micro system which was returned because it did n't have the full data recording feature as advertised data recording was crippled by drm limitations this sony stereo costs half as much and has almost all the same functionality
this is an awesome little system for the size it was easy to set up even for an electronically challenged person like myself a lot of fine sound comes out of this compact system the price was great and delivered right to my door amazing
the product performs great it produces quality sound and offers excellent value for its price point the stereo does everything the manufacturer claims and it meets all my needs
i have just purchased my case logic dvd album this is the greatest way to store dvd's
everyone so far is right this is a great product to store your dvd 's you do have to trim the covers to fit beyond that is works perfectly i have 3 of them i would recomend this to anyone with a large dvd collection
caselogic has set the standard for media storage and this continues the tradition a few tweaks are needed however i am certain that i will soon fill the 20 slots therefore it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk the graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed actually i would prefer that the dvd companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around
if you have a lot of dvds or cds these wallets are the way to go i have over 800 cds and they were eating up my space after getting rid of all the jewel cases i can store all of my cds and dvds on one book shelf and since i organized them by theme it is easy to find what i am looking for by the way you can mark the outside of the wallets with a pen it makes it easy to know what 's inside each wallet for the dvd wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the liner notes but it is easy to do trust me once you start using these wallets you 'll love 'em for what you get with these wallets i find the price fair even better here on enjo
i was scepticle at first that something looking that flimsy could really hold the weight of 622 cds the assembly was easy though time consuming i would recommend that you use those plastic washers otherwise if you decide to move the rods you get nasty marks on the wood i would recommend this unit to anyone wanting all of their cds in one spot very stable even on carpet
this monitor is one of the best i 've ever seen it works perfectly the picture is wonderful the controls are great on the monitor this is my first lcd monitor and i just love it if you are thinking about it buy this one it is well worth it
i liked this monitor a lot the picture is good it 's also light enough for me to carry it was easy to hook up i have had sony monitors before and liked them
i am very leery about these flat screen monitors however i am enjoying the sony very much i bought a pixo and it blew out in only three months someone told me to get a sony they 've had it six years and nothing happened to it yet so your reviews are very helpful to me thanks guys
i searched and hunted this monitor for the best price for months i first saw this monitor at best buy i was so impressed with the quality of the picture i was sold on xbrite '' but i hesitated at the price of 399.00 i watched the ads for months checked other retail outlets searched other online retailers and went back to best buy on several occations to see this monitor hoping i could catch this item as an open box item '' i am very happy with this monitor set up was a breeze connect plug in and go when i do buy a new pc with digital for monitors this monitor is already able to switch the clarity is remarkable i am using 1280 x 1024 resolution that fits this screen perfectly i ca n't add anymore to what other reviewers have already said about it stats as far as quality and service and price from i give them 5 stars i have no complaints i would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for quality
whether you have a viao notebook or a sony plasma tv or a flat panel or even a crt sony offers one of the most striking and crystal clear images in this world it 'll cost you a lot more than brands like acer viewsonic or dell but mind you sony has been making tv 's for a lot longer than any of these companies so their technologies carry over to all of their displays ca n't go wrong with this japanese marvel of a company
after reading tons of info checking critics ' recommendations and comparing monitors online i went to check them out at a compusa store after seeing some of the monitors and brands the critics like many of the monitors appeared similar with only vague differences except this sony it outshined all others by a wide margin there are two sony models that have the same frame so be sure you look at the one with the xbrite '' technology because it 's very different i have never needed the height adjustment and wires are totally unobtrusive this was a plug and play unit no adjustments were necessary i changed the but went right back so far after about a month living with this monitor i ca n't say too many good things about it
i have started to use this with my new gaming computer and i have found it a very nice product i got it for 340 making it cheaper then the others and also making it a very good buy after spending so much on other things i would highly recomend this and hope you get it for as good a deal as i did from this site
i purchased this for my special needs son who is 4 and needed a case for his cd player it is very lightweight and soft and has space for a few of his cds the adjustable belt is very easy to open and close and make larger and smaller i am very pleased to have made this purchase
the walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses the sound is excellent but i use an older set of sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set the unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time it is quite small and the only disadvantage i 've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket
i just ordered the second one for our family it 's the sony player to join our househould they 've been very dependable and they 're easy to use the software is simple the sound is great and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time my teenagers girls love that they come in colors and they 're different than what most of their friends have mom loves that they 're affordable
this is the greatest little player ! ! ! the sound is great good bass the size is very convenient and everybody who see it wants one it fits in a pocket has an armband option or a key ring option even little speakers as an option i 've taken it on so many trips there is a caution though even though the software is good for windows plus or better you can not download from the web unless you have windows xp
this is my first portable player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls i did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what hold '' meant on the screen but other than that very nice little product good price and very easy to use
well to begin with i am a complete ipod hater the whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features does n't sit right with me but after robbing my bro of his for so long since i had none it was time to get something of my own i chose this walkman bean player the size is sick ! fits between a few fingers also it is sony a trusted company unlike apple who will give you the runaround the navigation and menu is so simple i did n't read the manual and i figured it out the only thing i read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio but that is negligible anyhow i looooove it great bargain sound investment
just wanted to note that the contract is available at the top of this page if you buy this service plan print out the contract and keep your receipt i have no idea how true they are to their contract but i read the service plan intensely since i nearly got it some notes on the contract 1. it is only good in the united states including washington dc but minus maine but it does not include guam virgin islands etc so if you are in another country or outside the 50 states this contract will be nothing but a waste of money 2. this contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple 3. they will only if the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item that is if the manu warranty is still good you have to use it 4. if the item needs to be shipped will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period if the item is being replaced you will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered product to our authorized service center reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to you '' i 'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you 5. no lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the same defect and a upon the time of a repair as determined by them they will replace it with a product of comparable performance repairs performed while the product is under manufacturer 's warranty do not apply '' does n't sound like a great no lemon policy your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you many electronics are covered by the manufacturer for 1 year 6. there are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans such as they do n't cover accidents and they do n't cover the elements or acts of god '' sorry i had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things but in all seriousness read the list before you purchase so now that i have summarized much of the contract if you want to get the service warranty please read the contract since i did n't cover everything ! ! ! do n't hold me liable since i do n't have much money anyways also i think this is typical in warranty contracts but you will occassionally see the phrase at our discretion '' in the contract assuming they are n't jerks with their discretion and are n't too tough to deal with i would give the warranty 4 stars minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy i did n't get the coverage because the product i was going to get it for had just made into the next price category so it was pricy for my product being at the lower price end of the scale
i have had three of these units for the past years one for my pc one for the wife 's and one for the tivo cable box we have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running however they do n't last too long on battery power just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things down the batteries wore out after about years so i replaced them using batteries from a web vendor now the first battery of this second round has failed so i 'm buying another round of three batteries hopefully these units will last many more years
had mine since december 1999 but noticed that the battery failed after about 3 years like the other poster wrote apc did n't list a replacement at first but now they do and i finally got around to replacing it battery type is for those wondering solid unit having a telephone and usb controller is a plus
this unit is my ups made by apc i out grew the other and decided on this unit the usb connection is what sold me on this as i leave my computer on most of the day it did shut down using the included software during a test i ran and the software as gives you a battery charge state a must have if you are in an area that has frequent power problems with the built in surge protection you ca n't go wrong
i have about 25 apc at my job where i am currently work for school when the thurderstorm hits my school many time it wo n't kill all of computer server and others important computer i am so gladly to have this apc because save my time to maintance if lost everything i want buy one of my own personal at home which i need
i can take about 150 pics and i can record seven min of vide
i have had this controller for just about two years and have had no technical issues with it at all i never installed any software for it i simply plugged it in and it has worked flawlessly ever since it may lack the frills of a more expensive controller but i am very pleased with its toughness until there is a game pad for the pc that can accomplish this level of quality while including all the other bells and whistles i 'll stick with the durability feature instead
i installed this controller on winxp while i was playing an emulated game i noticed that my keyboard did n't work and there was no way to exit out of the game to minimize the screen so i reset the computer and now the keyboard does n't work at all must be something to do with that installation cd i recommend before installing this controller to follow the instructions in the users manual on creating a restore point that you can go back to incase something like this happens
i nearly bought a logitech gamepad but saw the glowing reviews of this device i just got started back into the action and racing genres it 's got great touch and seems sturdy enough for the long haul
i bought this game pad to replace my logitech wingman rumble pad and it works great and its alot better than the wingman rumble pad i highly recommend this gamepad
this has got to be the best looking and best performing joysticks out there for the pc not only is the performance and feel of this joystick the price is also great ta
i got two of these and as others have said this is a great game pad for the money it feels sturdy and has good well placed buttons
i got this for my baby 's room i was worried about the sound quality as per the other reviews but it 's quite good though i do n't have the ear of an audiophile the bass is pretty powerful the treble is good as well there is a equalizer with 4 presets which works effectively as well the room is about ' and this stereo has more than enough capacity for this room cd 's appear to work effectively panasonic has generally had good cd support subdirectories are supported i 'm very pleased
it 's amazing how tough it is to find boomboxes that have cd players capable of playing cd 's apparently the industry has decided that most people do n't want this feature in their cd boombox they must assume people get their fix from ipods and similar devices but for those of us who 've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest ipod i think the latest version is down to a size device this is a solid player for that purpose and the cassette is also handy if you want to tape from your cd or any cd or the radio for the benefit of those you may know who still have n't gone to cd yet there are still a few of those out there as well generally this is a good product though there are a couple of drawbacks first the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries this seems kind of silly given that remotes are n't exactly power hogs now this could simply be a quirk of mine and may not be a feature of the product overall but i really did n't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one so i 've decided to live with this it 's not often it 'll be on pure battery mode the other minor complaint is that it 's not possible to within an track when playing an cd regular cd 's can fastforward within a track not sure why it does n't since every other cd player i 've come across does discman car cd player etc but it 's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view the sound equalizer is very minimal but truthfully i was n't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall and things i found no problem with the modes available and find that this is doing the job i needed it to do just fine
just bought mine last week and just like many other consumers i was searching for radio and remote advantages are 1 the only smaller desktop unit that i found with radio and remote 2 has sleep timer 30 minutes 60 minutes 90 and 120 minutes this is handy for cd 's 's and the radio 3 fairly good sound for the money 4 easy to use remote i leave mine next to the unit disadvantages are 1 earphone plug in the back of the unit when i want to plug in my earphone it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design ! 2 my biggest disappointment no resume on cd or ! i listen to alot of audio books and i find this a real inconveince ! i have to go to the track that i think i left off or write it down ! my panasonic cd small portable has this why did they forget this in this one 3 terrible reception on am static ! 4 sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use i bought this because it is the only unit with a timer and remote that i could find ! since the am radio is so terrible i ended up buying the sony so i can listen to my am talk shows this one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes a clock and easy to use overall i still give it a 4 because of it 's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes i wish i would have bought it on amazon not at radio shack they were about 25 more live and learn ! if you are looking for a all in one with cd cassette remote and radio this is about the only one that you will find and i looked for 3 months ! update september 18 2006 after owning this one month i like it better and better ! i love the sleep feature that you can use up to 120 minutes 2 hours either on the radio or the cd ! this automatically shuts the unit off it is a great feature if you are listening to a cd that contains 40 hours of 's on it and you do n't want it to play all night
could n't find a boombox that was lightweight but sounded good and had it is fine does everything i expected it gets more useage than my hi priced bose
not as easy to use as a larger panasonic i used to own but otherwise fine good sound using cd player and radio buying via amazon as usual is super
overall i 'm very happy i wish there was a resume feature for cds with on them other then that it 's good
the silicone is great quality fits the nano snugly and the arm band is nice wonderful product does what it 's supposed to do for a fabulous price recommended
this is a great little disposable armband i say disposable because its so cheap you can toss it if you want and get a new one nice adjustable band although i can see this wearing out in the future as the band loses elasticity great for the gym it even comes with a little custom fit lcd screen protector which is a nice touch the arm band is removable so even if you are just looking for a skin this is a stea
there 's not really a lot to say about this product it protects your nano the material is good quality it is not too thick does n't bulk up the nano too much and not too thin provides enough protection i wanted this to go jogging with my ipod it fills that function perfectly the strap is comfortable the only flaw that i have found this does not bother me but i know it might bother others hence 4 instead of 5 stars the material does act as a bit of a dust collector if you put it in a dusty packet it will collect a lot of dust
way more affordable than what is out there fits ipod nano snuggly and adjusts nicely great for runners
i have used this item frequently on solo marathon training runs works fantastic a better buy than the apple brand armband by far
this armband was certainly the right price i use it everytime i work out at the health club i never have to remove it to charge the nano my only negative comment is that dust sticks to the screen cover and can not be cleaned off due to the compsition of the screen cover material
this is a great product that was delivered without hassel fast service right to my door
this is definitely a great investment i can take as many pictures as i want to and not have to worry that the stick is getting full i have two sons who also like to take pictures and in the past i would have to take my pictures off the stick so they could use it to take their pictures because the stick we were using had less memory and got full really fast now i can leave my pictures on the memory stick as long as i want to until i 'm ready to download them or delete them everyone should start off with a memory stick because it 's convenient and really worth the money spent
the sony 1 gb memory stick has tons of room for all my photos it makes it great when you 're on a vacation and you do n't have to worry if you have enough room for anything more you do pay a little more though for the sony brand than you would a chip with another manuf
the 1 gb card took all the pictures on a trip to hawaii over 300
really great the product got delivered before what i expected
we ordered this item to go with our new sony digital camera we drove all around colorado and this memory stick was perfect for storing all our pictures we even were able to do a 'slide show '' on our computer for our family and friends after we got home
i am very glad i purchased this and that too from amazon i just love the service i get from amazon
i purchased this for my new sony digital camera and so far all has been perfect just click it right in and you have a gig of space i 've been shooting pics like crazy ! throwing in a 640 fine movie mode to boot and still have room for a ton of pics ! love the card love the camera ! !
a memory stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a sony camera fantastic
i bought this 2 years back and still it is in great shape recently i forgot compact flash in my shirt pocket and went for washing and then followed by drying my wife found compact flash in dryer and i thought it would not work surprisingly it is working fine and i could see my past snapshots with out any problem
i 've been using this card with my canon for the past 9 months and am very pleased with it however about a month ago i noticed that the write speed increased from about a second to seconds per image it 's kind of annoying since it was so quick before but other than that the card has served me well
first i bought a sandisk and after a month of use got damaged i tryed to comunicate with them a lot they have the worst customer service then i gave up then i bought this viking like a year ago and im still using it
i bought this card for my digital camera and i have had it for a while now i have not had any problems with it it was fairly cheap and the speed seems to be fine i reccomend it for anything except recording full video at 30 fps because since this is n't a high speed card when i tried to record at that quality and resolution i only got about 15 or 20 seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow other than that i like this card and reccomend i
i 've been using this system for a couple of months now and could n't be happier with it i bought it for my office so i could listen to my classical cds while i was working on my website and writing book reviews plus even though it only has a short external antenna i can get the npr classical music station on fm which is over a hundred miles away it 's small enough to fit on my bookshelf and has great sound for the size of its speakers of course it does n't compare to my big stereo in the living room with its 4 ' high tower speakers but who cares it delivers most of the sound i need in a small space for background music all in all well worth the money so far highly recommended at this point
it has become nearly impossible to find a compact stereo of any quality with a cassette deck and an aux input i mean what is with the marketing hype these days of and ipod compatible ! '' all you need is an aux line input for pete 's sake my old jvc purchased nearly 20 years ago had aux in and with the help of easily found adaptor still plays all my ipods just fine but the belt drive on the tape deck failed twice and repairing it is no longer an option so we bought this and it works but the build quality is less than stellar the sound is simply ok and the remote works provided you have a clear line of sight to the unit but all that given the price i think it 's a good deal hope this helps
out of the carton everything worked as advertized and the sound is pleasant the speakers are the weak link the day after i set it up to test it i replaced the speakers with an inexpensive pair of radioshack speakers i bought years ago model i believe 4 '' woofer '' tweeter in a small solid sealed enclosure of walnut veneer these speakers are half the size of the supplied sonys and at least twice the weight the improvement in sound was astounding it transformed this package which has a robust amp into something worth listening to for hours on end it reproduced a wide range of music from a beethoven string quartet to louis armstrong doing fats waller to renee ' fleming doing marietta 's lied '' with full orchestra all with surprising authority my only concern with the main unit is that the latch on the cd lid on top of the unit may one day wear out preventing the lid from closing the cassette player worked without any problems i have yet to learn how to set the timer for the unit to turn on but the instruction book is clear and the remote is handy and easy to use i wonder how my main system with axiom and a klipsh subwoofer would sound off this modest box from sony or the old jensen i use in my 'study ' system put a classic pair of jbl lancers on this unit and i do n't think you would be the least bit dissappointed as i said out of the carton the system works fine and the sound is pleasant enough but be aware that the electronics in the box are waiting to bloom if you have an old pair of moderately efficient speakers in the basement or attic dust them off hook them up and enjoy
i was trying to find a small unit for the bedroom to replace a previous unit the model 30 watts not the fits the bill the sound is incredible and loud for a small unit it sounds better than the bigger unit i had the design of the speakers with the special bass produces a very rich and round sound and that 's without the dsg activated the bass and treble can be adjusted -3 to +3 but only with the remote if you buy a unit used be sure it has the remote also i needed something with a tape player like another reviewer
it does everything i expected to do easy manual and set up great sound i am keeping it
as the previous reviews had said no frills basic functions good sound compact size clean look and a reasonable price exactly what i have been looking for for a long time and could not find !
for 100 this little stereo does everything i need it to this micro '' unit is truly small it fits on top of our microwave speakers and all the replaced a boombox that conked out to replace it i wanted something through which i could play my player that function works well it is an simple auxiliary input and allows me to play my podcasts at home without walking around with headphones on at 30 watts the sound is ample for the kitchen and significantly more powerful than what i had previously i did n't want something so powerful that needed to be played loudly in order to get full sound that is not to say it ca n't put out some volume however as for sound quality it is the very crisp balanced sound that sony fans have come to expect for the wide range of music i play the bass and treble settings cover it all the player may discourage some people but since it can play cds you can get some serious playtime out of it for myself my cooking is rarely so complicated that i ca n't stop to change a cd anyhow but i saved the best thing for last it has a cassette player ! insert cricket chirps here all in all i am very happy with this unit for its versatility size and sound quality it was the perfect solution for my needs
if you 're looking for bells and whistles look elsewhere if you 're looking for 3 or 5 disc changer not this one if you need a nice little stereo to play one cd at a time space saving full and clean tone this is awesome ! ! ! it looks really sharp has a crisp sound perfect for a small bedroom or office i am very happy with this purchase has a tape deck as well and radio eq settings are simple no presets just bass and treble there is also dsgx switch kind of like a loudness setting just leave it on very simple well made i like it ! ! no frills great price
this portable cd holder is perfect for me i work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym my cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd 's i like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch i would recommend it to anyone
i am currently running an online business the expandability that this piece of equipment provides for our laptops is a great asset
i bought it thinking that would help me entering ascii codes because my inspiron it 's uncorfortable with some programs in spanish but does n't work with alt key i do n't know why because everything is working good i 'd like someone tell me if ther 's something i should do
i hate not having a number pad on my laptop and this product ameliorates that situation good stuff
the objective was to improve speed when i 'm write down figures and doing maths 100 acomplished maybe the keypad it 's a solution for that kinf of stuff i use it for anything more but that was the idea for get it the price is reazonable the service of amazon good as usual considering i 'm from chile and always when i purchase something in amazon always come to me ok
i certainly wish it were smaller but i guess that 'd be hard to manage while retaining the feel of a normal keypad the unit works well and adds some features that would probably be handy for spreadsheet work like enter and backspace keys
i bought this to read my smartmedia cards and it worked very well as an added bonus it is also a nice looking product it is sky blue and has a clear usb cord sort of reminds me of an imac good little inexpensive card reader note i did't use it for any card type other than smartmedia
this system is not the most sophisticated or powerful you can buy but it represents a great value for the money i 've had no trouble operating it after a reasonably quick and simple installation a great feature is the changer after you 've tried it you will wonder how you did without it the ability to move from disk to disk without having to them is a huge conveinience factor highly recommended
i have this in the bedroom connected to a 13 '' tv it plays dvds as well as cds the sound is great and it has a classy understated look i am thinking of buying one for my office and once for the garage
first of all let me say that i love this stereo have had it for a year or two i do n't think you can do any better with this price range and more i highly recommend it i have a question does anyone know whether this stereo plays dvd 's of all regions i tried to write jvc an email but did n't get any response hopefully somebody has the answer ! thanks
when i saw this component stereo system in a good guys '' store i was immediately impressed with the overall look of the thing as i started toying with the floor model i realized how versatile it was and decided that it was something i wanted to own sadly the floor model was the only unit left in the store and there would n't be anymore coming since good guys '' was going out of business that was not acceptable to me so i went elsewhere to find the same system when i found the item for a much better price i was sold getting it only took a few days and it was delivered right to my place of work for my convienence what impressed me the most about the unit was the sheer depth of sound it produced when playing a movie with grand scenes and lots of special effects the little system did not disappoint in giving a theatrical experience in sound other features were also pretty cool to me such as the lcd light while it gave off a nice blue glow it could be dimmed which was a nice touch all in all with all the features this device has i am certain i will have many years of enjoyment it is a great system for the right price and truly impressive
i needed a small system for my office i wanted removable speakers good sound at all volumes and a sleek look this system filled that void i searched for about a month to get it and there is nothing less than fantastic about this system even the price in terms of sound i can understand music at all volume levels many cheaper systems distort at low levels and at high volumes it sounds great i ca n't use it at high volumes now that i 've taken it to work but i am thinking about buying another for my living room at home run the output of my family room stereo and i 'll have a system that sounds good in both places for parties in terms of looks this system is very cool i tried to downplay it by placing it behind my desk on the shelf where i keep my food so that people would n't question it because small stereos are allowed but not everyone likes us having them despite my attempts to blend it in i 've received several complements on the way that it looks silver casing and a sleek design are just the basics this system features a blue backlit display that looks great ! i thought that the dvd '' option in the stereo meant that you could play on dvd a great idea for someone who wants to never have to change cds but in fact it meant that the system is a dvd player and it has a video output to connect to your tv that 's a nice plus i have n't tried the idea yet so it may or may not support them the stock antenna is terrible but so are most stereo antennas i 'll buy a new one soon the other downside is that you ca n't switch between presets without the remote you can change the station but not using presets but with 30 fm presets i 'll never run out ! the only thing that was n't obvious about the is that the disk buttons disk 1 disk 2 etc on the stereo are the eject buttons not the select buttons like most other stereos overall this is a great design for a great stereo i used to work at a radio station as the engineer and now i wish i had this back then because i could blast music in my office and really utilize the system the way it was meant
this is a good basic wifi access point i 've bought many easy to set up and use it occasionally disconnects but a firmware upgrade usually fixes it easily i have many in service
i bought two the second one after realizing that one will not work as a bridge it plugs into the linksys cable gateway in one room and to a switch in the other room nothing more to say follow the instructions and it will work as advertised
i 'll admit after reading some of these reviews i was a little weary of purchasing this unit but i got it for 32 so could n't pass it up i was replacing a linksys wireless b in a nutshell i followed the instructions to connect the hardware popped the cd in my hard wired '' desktop pc took a couple of minutes to step through the setup screens which are totally simple to navigate enabling wep along the way when i was done i fired up my laptop which has built in card network was detected immediately all i had to do was type in the wep key which was generated from my passphrase entered during the setup and viola ! connected at 54 mbps ! ! awesome the setup procedure could not have been any easier i would recommend this device to anyone that already has a router with a free port and simply wants to add or upgrade connectivity in their home
everything it says it is and it 's not as bulky as the adapters with large wires strung out the back of a oval looking hub slick looking
this is a great product for those who need to transfer files from a digital camera without the hasle of software its easy and quick i use it every chance i get and it fits in your pocket what more can you ask for
i love the mobilemate sd i have n't had any problems yet it 's small compact and gets the job done
which turned out to be a problem for me since thats not what i wanted i was looking for a compact flash card reader for the older compact flash cards and just assumed that sd and cf were the same luckily i also has some transflash cards that i am using it with and it works great i especially like the small design with no cords like a lot of other flash readers have
this tiny piece of plastic with metal contacts packs more whallop than you could imagine sure memory geeks like me may find little things like this more than the next but practically speaking it is good for more than just the techno geek what this large amount of memory provides is a way to store tons of pictures movies ringtones etc over a long period of time and then you can dump '' it onto your computer the other thing you can do with it is store a lot of music to play on your
i bought this card reader to use with my sd memory cards from my digital camera and palm tungsten transferring pictures and music via the cables supplied with the camera and palm is a bit slow and who needs more cables this little device allows me to add delete copy and paste files using my computer it takes up virtually no room and i use it between both my desktop and laptop computers there was no installation issues i have windows xp on both machines and it recognized and installed the card reader immediately without any interference from me last but not least the price ca n't be beat
this gizmo is really cool i use it with my verizon phone and tranfer music and data back and forth as i wish with no problem
i purchased the elite pro sd card but found out that my older simpletech flashlink card reader is not able to recognize the card under winxp with and without the most recent simpletech drivers i do n't have another card reader for my computer but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my pda so i assume that it 's the card reader shortly afterwards i also discovered that kingston makes a combo kit that includes their usb 2.0 reader for a bit less in price than the card alone i also noticed the atp line of and sd cards i have no experience with their products but their sd cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell they tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof i 'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors i will consider the atp cards in the future
great value for your money kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product
this one was purchased for my pocket pc have been storing files pictures and more important my recordings clearly it 's not as fast as other memories out there on the market but it has made my life easier and dam i got it at a really good price !
this is a great buy because i have a lot of space i use the card on my digital camera and i take a lot of pictures without download to the computer i can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until back home it 's a great card at a very good price
i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again
the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent
i 'm afraid i do n't know a lot about this technology i went for economy and i am getting very good quality photos i think i would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and i really do n't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow its still faster than my old one so i 'm generally happy hope this is some hel
hi i 'm a tomtom addict i 've been addicted ever since i first plugged in my tomtom 300 and found a new way to work ever since i 've relied on my tomtom to get me from point a to point the user interface is easy to use intuitive and clever and allows me to find nearby restaurants hotels or even train stations nearby my tomtom is so great i 've even let friends borrow it at work when they have a meeting with a client they have never been to before there are some problems anytime i find my way somewhere using my tomtom i ca n't find my way home without the tomtom that 's why i 'm addicted it 's reduced my frustration in the car and made me really happy thanks tomtom your friend never lost dre
i used it around my city and even took it to hawaii and it was a lot of help people forget that the idea of the gps is to help you find where you are where you want to go and how to get there but like everything else it may not be 100 correct really is what i did n't like about it was the windshield mount broke so it no longer sticks on the windshield the biggest thing is that the maps are i live in an area where they are building a lot of new homes even developments that are 2 years old are n't on the map ! i do n't mind paying for updates i realize that someone has to get paid to update the maps but i will not pay several hundred dollars to buy a whole new set of maps
received the tomtom 300 before date promised in perfect condition even though the box was dented good packing ! i have used the tomtom to go from nyc to monticello ny and from atlantic city new jersey to philadelphia pennsylvania and home to nyc again the tomtom performed flawlessly in philly guiding me to the sites i wanted to visit and back to my hotel i also tested it on routes i knew to see how it would route me if i deviated and it came through with flying colors the only shortcoming is that the display is difficult to read in bright sunshine the voice makes up for that letting you know when a turn is coming up i have a who has used this device for two years and is very satisfied i bought it on his recommendation and do not have any regrets
the tomtom go 300 did a great job navigating me around an unfamiliar city i 'd be lost without it for sure i would recommend anyone getting this it saved so much time i would have devoted to reading maps had i not had it
truely wireless the remote alert sender unit runs on 4 aa batteries i do n't know yet how long they last mine are now two weeks old and still good the unit senses when any movement passes by i live in the country and now i know when someone comes in the yard before i would n't always hear the car only drawback is that it picks up deer dogs and other critters walking past at all hours of the day and night i like this unit it serves a purpose for me that other people may not have but it works as advertised and nothing gets past it without it alerting me the range is said to be 1000 that is probably correct mine is about 300 fromt he reciever unit and it works great the two way voice '' speaker is the icing on the cake i love being able to yell at the neighbors dogs to get on out of here '' it 's a real hoot to watch the surprise they get when my voice comes out of the tree i have less problems with the neighbor 's dogs coming into my yard and bothering 'my ' pets now
i 've been driving a logitech momo black for about 3 years and loved it until now this new wheel pedal and gearshift set is in a word awesome with 900 degree wheel rotation stronger force feedback a clutch and gated shifting the level of realism is unbelievable did you ever want to go racing but could n't afford the time or cost with this set and live for speed rfactor or one of these days iracing 's as yet unreleased programs you can and after some practice in the privacy of your own home '' you can go online and race live with folks all over the world you heart will pound and you will sweat ! okay maybe i 'm weird but at i still manage to find time to race hours a week ! and there are no long tiring drives to the race track no hotel and food expenses no long waits for the other classes to get off the track and no long drive home with a wrecked car on the trailer behind you an hour behind the wheel is an hour racing i have a heart valve problem and there are times i wonder if this is really safe after all
i 've had a few wheels before but finally logitech came out with a wheel thats simulation grade the 6 speed shifter works great and as for the clutch i 've found that there are plenty of games that support it including and need for speed carbon thats just coming out besides the lengthy setup and steep price this is a great wheel for a great racing experience
first the good the feedback is strong and prescise very smooth steering and it will immerse you into the game nfs most wanted and gtr 2 are great with this wheel the shifter is awesome although you do not want to beat it up a ginger approach makes it work best the pedals are very solid with good tension although you have to have very small feet if you are going to use all three i use my clutch for the brake forgetting the middle pedal now for the bad the clamping system works but for how long plastic screws are only going to last so long and you have to really tighten them for the wheel to stay put there are mounting nuts on the bottom but are you going to drill 2 holes through your desk microsoft has a superior clamp in my opinion the shifter works well and i am sure it will last with care be nice to it though the pedals are to close together other than that they are perfect overall i highly recommend this wheel for the money you ca n't get a better wheel
supposedly someone listened at the logi office of the nascar momo discontinuation for a cheeze model of nearly equal price that does not excuse this exorbiance the clutch pedal is not implimented in games and until it is you are paying for a dead hand or foot this wheel and the transmission hump style gearshift is quite cool and gee whiz is the first the console buttons are only useful again if the game does n't back out of it hard truck series backs out of any digit button or other past 10 with in a few minutes play time as it is not designed that way and can cause software corruptions one would usually need this for race car games but it can be used in other driver games making it more diverse and no need to buy a separate unit for compatiblity probs however in as and most games do not even use more than six or eight buttons or macros at a time the extra buttons are redundant gimiks the styl'n corvette style shifter with the console buttons is nice to look at stick a virtual transmission hump of carpeted cardboard on the ground under it for realistic effect and the gear can shift better than a rudder better used as a turn signal other than that either go down on price or give us config in games that do not support it shift is simply a way of saying shift with the clutch how lameo is that
considering the logitech website states that this product is n't available until i do n't know why people are ancy mine came 3 weeks ahead of amazon 's estimate anyway phenomenal build quality largest diameter wheel available and sturdy pedal base are among the highlights the shifter unit feels flimsy but as long as you do n't overdo it it should last its still just cool enough that they were able to pack in a gated shifter with a sequential option i 've played rfactor and richard burns rally with the wheel and the feedback is awesome probably does it the best if you 're ready to step up from consumer wheels and you ca n't afford the prosumer brd and ecci stuff i do n't think you 'd be disappointed with this
i just got my email saying it shipped and am tracking it to receive it tomorrow so look for similar ones
i placed my order on october and for several days now it says 'the item is shipping soon ' which normally means it 's being packaged but it has n't actually been shipped i have n't called amazon yet but might do so today to find out what 's going on i want this wheel so bad
received notice last week that it was in the shipping stage it still is shows but it 's not actually shipping thought he page says it is contacted amazon and they say it 's shipping on the but the page still says and available for shipping i have no idea what 's going on here they were not at all clear did they
first of all let my point out that mine came with demos of crimson skies and mech assault and the full version of xbox classic arcade mine was new in the certified microsoft box etc maybe they just updated the games anyways it is in my opinion a better deal to buy the pack but i decided on the just because i 've got the trial already and did n't want 14 months built up in the box there 's the communicator headset a subscription card the game discs and several manuals on connecting to xbox live the communicator purely awesome i have read many people 's comments saying that it breaks at the little clip i grant it that the clip is thin and could potentially break easily but it is not uber fragile do n't be afraid to put it on the headset weighs next to nothing and is really comfortable it has great outgoing voice quality and great sound quality through the speaker xbox live itself do you have broadband do you have a router and a switch or hub if needed if the answers are both yes you need xbox live it is incredible buy this or the kit if you are just starting but do n't forget to start your account first with the free 2 months after you have live already renew with the subscription card
so far the item has worked excellent it looks very nice and was inastallation friendly i hope you keeep this item as i restore a lot of cars and this unit works well for me and is at a good price point thank you don snyde
i recently installed this unit into my 1995 geo prizm after the factory stereo lost its fm capabilities installation was a snap with the purchase of an adapter plate and power wire adapter i left the speakers from the previous radio in the car boston acoustics 5 '' in the front and jbl 6 '' in the rear am stations sound like the factory 's fm and the fm is so clear that i hear instruments in the music that i did n't hear before i must say that the dual unit lacks a low end unless you turn on the loudness '' and then it is adequate a large part of the problem is the jbl 's in the back i do not believe they are capable of cranking out bass the stations pull in great on both bands and there are plenty of stations to program 6 am and 18 fm i do n't know what the feature does in this unit it does n't seem to have an effect the cd player is very good very clear and has n't skipped when i am gone down bumpy roads and potholes there are claims of the brightness of the radio when driving at night well yes there is no question about the brightness it 's a nice blue and it does n't bother me a bit as a matter of fact it is easy to use the radio in the dark because the controls are easily seem and identified a weird feature '' about this radio is that when you have it turned off any button will turn it on any button ! this dual is worth every penny that i spent on it i did n't want to spend a whole lot of money for a radio in this old vehicle but i really got my money 's worth and more with this purchase
i liked the unit it is very well built materials and workmanship are close to perfect sound quality is also very good at least more than enough for a car player is quite fast it takes seconds to recognize the disk random play '' is not really random the sequence is always the same and very predictable controls are convinient radio reception is also very good the only issue which is very annoing blue leds highhlighing are extremely bright there is no way to dim them or swith off it 's hard to drive at the night time with the unit on i had to make a small black paper cover for it to get rid of this bright light
i was purchased this item for indian car the installation is very simple if you have a knowledge of installing such products then it is much more easier it plays all song formats without skipping is also good tuner is very good it tunes all stations bad regarding time display there is not time display in this item if you want to see current time you need ot click on disp button
ca n't ask for more clear sound nicely finished easy to use and the best part is the iplug just plug it and you are done your ipod does n't get power from the oultlet of the car better for ipod 's helth no interferience like fm modulators it does n't get any better for the price
i too was looking for an ipod connection for my saab that was original i could n't believe the price on this unit but the reviews convinced me anyway it was fairly easy to install took me an hour from start to finish all i needed were 12 solderless connectors and a wire tool i 've been using the unit for a week now and will agree with some reviews who say the lights are too bright great for daytime way too much for night i 've considered a couple options one was dark window tint overlays but i 've decided to alter the removable faceplate provided with the unit to fashion a cover i 'll slice the fp cover in half at the hinge giving me two covers some velcro and i 'll have a cover that will work at night set the unit how i like and place the fp cover over it using the velcro to secure should be a breeze to do i owned a 350 eclipse cd player and the dual does n't sound quite as good but the feature set price and ipod connector make up for the slight difference in sound quality the skip protection in the dual seems better than the eclipse all and all a great buy i 'm very happy with the dual
after reading reviews on this and other products i decided to go with the dual i got it from amazon for 79 and free shipping i 've been using it now for about a month and have not been disappointed by anything ! i was already expecting the ridiculously bright lights from the other reviews this stereo has so far been one of those purchases that keeps surprising me with it 's versatility and features i 've found that a quick perusal of the instructions was enough to be able to use almost all the important functions cd playback radio station presets radio scan eq customization switching between albums on a single disc mute external audio source plugin jack ipod or even a walkman etc the sound tends to be a little on the high and crisp end and i have to turn the bass eq up to 5 out of i think 8 to get a decent frequency range but it 's not bad enough to take away from the overall value of this gem overall i ca n't understand why this stereo was so cheap ! it 's way better than a pioneer model i bought a number of years back the have my little chevy thumping and i love the features of being able to pop 8 albums on a single disc and quickly switch between them this model is a gem and i would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a car player but who wants to spend less than 100 buy it
i have to agree with other posters here who praise the sound but ca n't stand the bright blue lights performance great ! it made the stock speakers in my ten year old corolla sound absolutely amazing much better than the much more expensive pioneer i installed in another vehicle a couple of years ago likewise the controls on the dual are straightforward and easy to use with the pioneer i had to get the manual out whenever i wanted to do something as simple as setting the clock no way to dim those damn blue lights though they are so bright that you ca n't see the control illumination at night i tried the trick of taking off the buttons but could n't get them out so i guess i 'm stuck with that
installation was easy with the correct harness and knowing your speaker config it took about 1 hour btw i have never install a car stereo before it has all the features you can think of from a player many small details like able to save preset volume and prefered eq and seperate them in fm mode or cd mode i am really impressed build in 200 watts amp creates a solid and deep sound with my factory speakers of course with a speaker upgrade and preamp it will sound alot better but this is really pretty good with no other modifications the is a blessing ever tried to play your with a fm modulator or tape adaptor they gernerally sound really distorted and at high volume the treble will crack the iplug is a simple plug that can plug into anything from the ubiquitous ipods to the cheap players you buy from the sound is always solid with no distortion and you can tap into the eq and amp to adjust the sound the bottom line is you really can not beat the price and quality of this inexpensive cd head unit i have no idea about the durability but i am really happy about it at the momen
the first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it does n't come with software for handhleds that person chose to buy it without and save some and then complained about having to pay extra for it because bought the wrong software package delorme did the right thing and offered us options i just ordered mine and i have no plans on using with a hh so i 'm very happy that i did n't have to buy the hh software just do n't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it nemerous people have highly recommended this to me although i have heard that ms mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option storing data points without a connection to a computer is awesome i will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route elevation etc too bad it is only in
item was received in good on time and works well
i use this in my laptop with microsoft street with gps it works great when you have multiple usb with only one port
for the time being as i am in the process of purchasing a new computer the usb device will work for my laptop taking into consideration the fact that i do n't have powered up devices attached to it that would draw from the laptop
it works well but be aware that it is usb 1.1 only i am not using it for my epson which is usb 2
works just excellent only thing is that a longer cord between the hub itself and the connection into the computer would be nice
we bought this device with the express intent of capturing old vhs tapes and putting them into dvd format for that it works and the bundled software meets the need however ! this vhs to dvd is a long and slow process so do n't kid yourself into thinking that the hw decoding in this box is going to make that a process the actual making '' of the dvd movie is still very time consuming as is the editing i 'm not so impressed with windvd but my son who did most of the editing preferred its ease of use over the ulead product which was also included we had trouble with one of the usb ports even though all of the ports on the pc purchased less than a year ago are supposed to be high speed 2.0 usb but using another port allowed the device to be found and connected i wish there were some way to tell if frames are getting dropped some video was pretty choppy and did n't look that way on the vhs but i could n't quite figure out what was causing the problem and it did n't repeat on later uses so far we 're happy we got it if the arrives too much struggle i 'll be even happier
i just make it very short ! i 'm very satisfied with plextor it is just i expected to be ! all my home videos are digitalized with no problem at all i even recorded shows from my tv and everything working as it must be ! i suggest warmly to use this converter
excellent product all my vcrs are dying of old age i am converting my home library to dvd with very good results once you figure our ulead and windvd conversion is just a matter of time spent running each video
i purchased the plextor converter on advice of nero they claimed that it would be compatible with their software after i plugged it in and tried to convert my tape the system froze that happened several times i wrote about this to nero they asked me to send them a report i did that that was almost two weeks ago i am still waiting for a reply as they are notorious with their responses you may want to contact nero directly however i doubt if it will work in future you may want to put some sort of safeguards in place referring to the software vendors with the description of your product s otherwise i am very satisfied with the service i have received from you as i bought many other items through you martha pelensk
one of the reviewers said that this product records the video as an file and compromises the quality of the video because it is not saved as an avi file actually it does save the video as an avi file ! the problem with avi files is that they can not be displayed on a tv set you have to convert them into a format that can be read by the dvd player and displayed on your current tv thus when you want to put that avi file on a dvd it is converted to so is as good as it gets right now for normal digital video for editing you should leave your video in avi format because editing causes further degradation of the video i have used this product for about a year now and it works great i initially had some problems with quality but once i updated to the latest drivers from the companies website it worked fine this is probably why some of these reviewers gave it bad marks because they did n't download the newest drivers available i got this to convert my old vcr tapes to dvds and it worked perfectly the windvd software that is included is easy to use and works great my computer os is window xp remember to look at the most recent reviews of this product many of the latest drivers may not have been available for the earliest reviewers great product !
i really love these speakers the fidelity of the bass is terrific as per come on closer '' by jem say my regular system has magnaplanar speakers with a subwoofer and this system gives me much the same effect as the maggies that the music is n't coming from a single point more like being in a concert setting than hearing sound from a box quibbles the volume controls are nearly impossible to find but that makes them inconspicuous once you 've found them ! the subwoofer is not tiny in terms of fitting under a desk 12 '' diameter if you ca n't imagine yourself fidgeting with the fishbowl in stockinged feet you might pass on this item if you think you can handle that however you 're going to love these speakers
these speakers are both stylish and sound great a nice compliment to my first mac computer
i got the soundsticks to use as a home stereo in a small room i was n't expecting superb sound quality and the soundsticks really suprised me with the full and detailed sound they produce overall the product is great value for money and the space it takes up my only gripe is that there is no off button on them so the only way to power off is to unplug them i 'm not sure how much power they use when idle but not being able to power off is definitely a down side if you 're energy conscious
i just received my soundsticks yesterday and could not be happier with their performance i am using them to listen to streaming audio on my pc from a radio station in italy that plays jazz and the nuances of that style of music are well suited to the sound sticks the sleekness of the design is superb as well the nice price makes this purchase a home run
i 've owned several sets of the original soundsticks and purchased this set for my wife 's new intel imac as always the sound is amazing and plentiful with the subwoofer providing strong thumping bass and the sticks emitting crystal clear highs we both love music and we often fire up itunes on the computer in the den and the volume is good enough to fill the house our friends are always amazed at the sound these soundsticks put out i 'm sure there are audiophiles out there who nitpick the output but if you are just a regular joe who enjoys your music and appreciates good clear and strong sound i promise that you will not be disappointed with soundsticks ii
i 'm not one to explain or understand most audio specs compare systems or buy the most expensive audio components there are this 3 piece speaker system was recommended by a coworker and the user reviews certainly helped in the decision making process still i was doubtful of course as i love my gizmos and the price was under 120.00 what kind of quality could this be for that price let me tell you i am blown away especially considering the price ! roughly 113.00 shipping and tax included and my whole room rocks ! fyi i listen to everything from marvin gaye nine inch nails acoustic to beethoven it plugs in via the same adapter as your headphones so there are no delays in the subwoofer like what usually occurs with the usb connected woofers the plastic is a tough and heavy material so do n't worry about them cracking under normal use and since the sticks are tall the base of the sticks are made of a heavy rubbery material so they wo n't fall over or slide unless your on top of beer kegs the right sound stick contains the volume adjustment sensors that take some time to get used to considering most computers have 2 other sources of volume control operating system 's and the music player you use i call them sensors because they do n't move they are like those cool lamps that brighten and dim when touched overall if you a person who wants a nice sound system for your computer that you can hear from a few rooms away and are not sure what to buy or how much to spend this is the way to go
the quality of the sound is very good indeed i would say crystal clear they were also a very good bargain the design is also very different the only disadnantage i have noticed is that they do not have a on off switch i use them to listen to music classical or modern either from my hp laptop or from my i strongly recommend the harman 's for room use
the dlo action jacket is a must have for all ipod owners that workout or are on the go the armband is the perfect way to secure your ipod when you are running or lifting i recommend the dlo action jacket to everyone
i got this jacket a month into having my ipod i had to buy it because i had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when i pulled the ipod out of that case it was easy to drop one time i did drop it and within a month of owning the ipod i had it in fro repairs this case protected my ipod of another 11 months just fine my complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out it is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface it will protect your pod though
after looking around at the local stores fry 's and compusa i had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my ipod in multiple environments on my belt and also in exercise and had resigned myself to having a skin '' type case for just everyday use and then shifting the ipod to an arm band for exercise not a particularly great solution expensive around 20 for each and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses then i ran into the dlo action jacket at best buy which seemed to cover all my intended uses unlike the prior reviewer i found my ipod fits very snugly absolutely zero slop and i really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case also at 29.95 it 's cheaper than the approach the only criticism i have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case the process is a little tedious but the end result is great the unit feels very secure on my arm and it 's easy to forget that it 's there this jacket is a winner
this case is made of nice material unfortunately the ipod fits rather loosely in the case also one of the velcro flaps on the top of the case covers the hold button on the ipod the case takes away from the ipod 's good looks and slightly hinders usage of the buttons it does n't do what i wanted it to do stay out of the way and simply protect the player however the case would be great to use just for jogging as it comes with a belt and clip that hold the ipod firmly
the dazzle is perfect i have used it to transfer from my husband 's camera sony memory stick from my camera comapctflash from my ipaq sd card and will try it with my new camera sd card it 's is way easier than bringing the usb cord and each camera with me this is one of the best purchases this has ever made i have had this for over 2 years with no problem
simply plug and play additionally dazzle reader shows up as a separate drive under window 's easy to move files back forth to the reader only glich is the stand very wish they had a better stand but the product is great and excellent price too
this is a great product i would recommend people to buy dazzle card reader i had this for over 3 months or so have not have any problem i would say but this one when a deal come by ! d
this reader and writer is absolutely fantastic ! i bought this after returning the biostar 6 in 1 reader from that unit would not read two smartmedia units i had but the dazzle knocked it out like a champ i use it for compact flash and sm 4 different brands and everything works great on the dazzle after the rebate the price is hard to beat !
i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it
just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers it does just what it 's intended to do produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit i had no trouble at all with the remote it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the ipod from a good 10 feet away my only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful ! altec lansing could do well to improve their instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself i was almost ready to return my unit initially when i discovered only by accessing altec lansing 's web page for the that i had to remove the plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my ipod photo otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price
when i bought it couple weeks ago i look out side the box is but inside the box speaker is i call the company they told me is as they said someone on the internet sell the is all same with the and also support the ipod video too
i bought mine for travel purposes and use the jbl on stage more when i am at home the jbl does sound better but i got a decent price on the altec it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option so i took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night thats 4 aa per night not exactly cheap i think that those who complain about the lack of battery options in other speakers do not quite understand exactly how many batteries they will be using i was out of the country but i still wish now that i wouldve taken my heavy '' adaptor with me you live and learn i guess everyone has special needs but in this case i can tell you 1 set of 4 batteries would last only 1 night so these are a decent set of speakers if the price is right packs well for travel but dont expect mindblowing sounds as its just a tiny lightweight speaker system its ok id give it more of a 3.5 star if i could
i am very happy with this product it folds super slim so traveling with it is a breeze ! pretty good sound not bose quality but for the price very respectable ! i 've had it almost a year and it has been along on many weekend and works great i use it alot so it was a good purchase for me
great sound quality powerfull enough to fill my living room though probably not with 25 people in party mode with a small footprint the remote requires you to point it somewhat accuretly at the speakers and is not as responsive as a remote for a tv probably because the remote is tiny and only has a battery so not enough power overall very good quality for a reasonable price
this system worked great for my 40 gb ipod the carrying case and interchangable are nifty for international travellers a word of warning the 60 gb ipod photo does not fit in the docking station altrec insisted that it does at the time i purchased it in july 2005. be sure to order the altec for ipod and ipod photo '' that is now available if you have the photo ipod
i 'm amazed simply amazed the price is way out there and this obviously is n't for everyone but it does everything it says well set up is super smooth get the manufacturer and model number type it in during set up on your computer and it is done thats it i do have multiple lighting and heating controls and it is a snap to set up as well and then you can have the remote send the setup information to other controllers as well tip do n't buy their lighting controls way over priced anything that is will work leviton sells a line for of the price
i have to say that i was a little bit skeptical because of the large price tag but found out through research that this product was actually fairly priced due to the custom programming features it had i quickly found out that this remote was better than other universals out there because it used rf and was able to control multiple av systems in my house i have not done it yet but i plan to buy the lighting products so i can turn off all of my lights at once from bed each night ! ! ! very cool
i 've had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer the monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is one thing that stands out here above all the other remotes wireless control over lighting i replaced my dimmers and switches with the monster dimmers and switches and now i can control every light in my house monster really does n't talk much about this feature but being able to hit all off '' at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer you can even map ligthing scenes to activities if you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time really cool good job monster
works great good coverage had a small problem setting it due to changeing my isp from cable to dsl called tech support and they walked me through the set up and even help with setting up my laptop it 's been two months since installation without any problems whatsoever
we currently have the linksys for our home network it 's been working great for about 4 years now but we 've now run out of ports i did some research on the 8 port product from linksys but the reviews were mixed the reviews were mixed for similar competing products also so i took the route of getting the to expand our existing home network i just plugged it into the network and it just worked out of the box no configuration needed it 's also very tiny i highly recommend the product
linksys tech support assured me that their were no limitations to this gizmos ability to route ethernet signals sure enough i plugged it in and it 's functioning exactly as i hoped our internet comes from a cable modem from that i ran the ethernet cable to the airport extreem which acts as a wireless router and it also has 1 out port for ethernet which i connected the switch to off the switch i am running a printer laserwriter pro 630 and a desk top i also have 3 wireless computers on the network and all are running all can access the internet i can print from any computer and fileshare between the whole lot i could n't ask for more
i have nothing to report that is the device has performed flawlessly in the years i have owned it i subjected this thing to almost every scenario except mac read on i used it at my office at a major research university where i connected among other things a vintage circa 1999 windows xp desktop a dell inspiron 6000 laptop with xp two variants of the dell dual xeon workstations running redhat and fedore core an ibm thinkpad laptop running xp a custom built amd athlon running every major linux distribution except debian as well as xp and a custom built amd dual core machine running suse 10. network cards ranged from to 0 and 4 year old netgear cards i used cables from 3 to 30 feet long and connected this to both a brand new wall jack and a retrofitted jack in a cold war era building finally the room this equipment operated in was subjected to temperatures from 55 f to 110 f as my office was not air conditioned during the summer and it was colder outside at 100 degrees the above computers made a lot of heat we had major power problems which did n't faze this thing one bit but were able to ruin more than one expensive apc ups unit oh and i downloaded at least 100 gb through this card during this period
this little baby is just hook up my desktop wireless ap wired router together it just works nothing else tips if you 'd like to use overseas buy nokia ac adaptor model it just works with nokia phone charger that 's all no question aske
i have other linksys routers and switches in my house and this works great in conjuction with them i have never even had to power anything off the data flows nicely and smoothly
the product works perfectly the only problem is the manual only includes directions for the most common setups to use one port as an uplink '' to a router for example you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled 1 '' and then leave port 2 '' open the directions do not state this and i had to call linksys to get it to work other than that it is fast reliable and small perfect
installation and network was a snap the fifth port is really the upstream connection so you get four clients not five
