cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top poorly designed it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it putting it together was a pain the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes designed doesnt even fit cds that well there are gaps and the cd casses are loose fitting pros i guess it can hold a lot of cds
it 's a nice look but it tips over very easily it is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows my advice is if you need a cd rack that holds a lot of cd 's save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy

we own the bought at costco it is possible that the newer d '' model has fixed the hissing we hear during mode we have owned it about a year now and i believe it is getting louder when the house is quiet i can hear it in the next room it does n't bother my wife she finds it restful i do n't like it because i do n't think it should be making any sound at all given the choice i would not buy this product again
cases very cheaply made break when opening not worth shipping cost waste of money
it is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them on the flip side once they have been opened once they do n't reclose very well
i knew these were inexpensive cd cases but i ca n't even open one without it breaking into two
i wish they had a rating for zero stars i bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters that 's a 24 success rate i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters memorex has really gone downhill
i hope it 's live because if it 's memorex it 's crap ! that 's my latest opinion after using this product i have a liteon and it hates memorex i rarely get a decent burn more often than not i 'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it my movies will skip stutter or stop all together so disappointing ! unfortunately i found out too late that memorex uses cmc media which only has a success rate !
i 'm afraid i have to agree with the other previously happy memorex users in noting that memorex rate has gone downhill i was skeptical when i read the other reviews and i stuck with memorex but i have seen the light now for a year i was very successful with the memorex disks in the 25 pack spindles i would buy they would all work in aug i bought 2 25 packs at circuit city a mistake that appears to have been a waste of money i just tried to burn a copy of something and i ended up trashing 4 disks in a row i was convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else then i remembered someone had given me a blank sony disk so i thought what the heck let me try that one into the sony drive it went and it copied without a hitch that was the final straw for my memorex loyalty out of a pack of 25 i have about 10 left but have had to trash 6 of the 15 i used not a good success ratio bye memorex
i 've previously purchased memorex media and have not had any problems until recently my latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price where do i start how about the fact that the media is labeled as and only burns at gray spindle how about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption video dropouts stutter or dvd i thought it was my recorder until i read all the reviews there has been a huge drop in quality recently if you want to gamble with the recent quality of the memorex branded media and hope '' every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here for me i 'm dumping more than 50 remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters
while i read the reviews on this machine it is clear to me that lexar has some serious problems for some people it worked for others it was a miserable failure i am in the latter group sigh mine was dead on arrival i tried the device with of my machines and in both cases it was unrecognized lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help
i got this item and it worked for about 4 hours then stopped working i tried the reader in 2 different computers nothing i contacted lexar customer support and they could n't help me save your money and buy something else
i used this reader for a week before it stopped working it worked ok for the week that it worked at all it would not read xd cards though it did not detect that a card was inserted at all i tried inserting the card fully partially and even tried jiggling it a little it seemed like the contacts on the card were touching the contacts on the reader but it would not recognize that a card was inserted it did however work with my compact flash card then inexplicably it stopped functioning entirely i unplugged it and plugged it back in and scanned for hardware changes in device manager but the card was dead i tried plugging it into another computer and it was not detected at all lexar support left a lot to be desired i explained the problem in detail and the response i got was a generic try restarting the computer etc etc '' then they wanted me to pay for shipping to rma their defective merchandise i sent it back to amazon instead and got my money back i 'm willing to assume that i just got a lemon but the piss poor tech support convinced me to get a refund rather than a replacement
i recently received this as a christmas gift and it did n't work from the start after much time wasted with their tech support '' the device was deemed defective their tech support is very poor all they could say try another xd card '' the device kept freezing my system the driver that came with the software did n't work a very frustrating experience if the tech support was more informative or supportive lexar might have redeemed itself i recently purchased the sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm right from the start their quick start guide is much more detailed and their software works ! save yourself a headache and buy sandisk
the lexar media 2.0 can not function smoothly with a one gigabyte card from olympus the help site explains how with my mac i can reboot my computer in os 9 classic then download the pictures then reboot in os not a satisfactory solution i felt screwed on discovering this after the purchase i feel like i simply acquired electronic junk there was no response from lexar when i emailed support which simply added to my feeling of being had
first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones always pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel ! ! ! ! !
hardware awesome software a flop since you have to use their software the package is destroyed i will give you the final nail on the coffin for me i tried to put podcasts on the device using the latest sonicstage 4. no chance it wants to be able to find each artist '' in the sony library this was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library i had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend no chance now shame as the hardware was
i knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true and sure enough they rejected my upcs i kept copies only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say 'whoops a mistake ' i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional
i had all the same rebate issues with this item as others so if you are buying this cd case just because of the rebate please do n't i did finally receive my rebate 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email i just cashed the check and i 'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through ! the product itself seems okay i can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break but i rarely get into my cds so i have n't had that issue yet however i do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around a very dishonest company if you ask me good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate
in theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive however i purchased three of these 2 for me 1 for a friend i ca n't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness all in all a disappointment
i also bought this item sent in all of the required documents including original upc rebate denied because upc was not included i emailed them 3 times stating that i did in fact enclose it also quoted the number from the copy of it that i retained to date have heard nothing from them i have now filed a complaint with the texas attorney general and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the ftc ji
i have a collection of over 1500 disks so i have bought many cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that i have purchased i would avoid this brand
i am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices however with my panasonic player this product was not compatible i could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to sd audio support
i purchased this game pad due to good reviews found it online for 15 with free shipping so had to try myself its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand the programming software is alright as well not as nice as the nostromo software for example but what i didnt like about it was much more relavant firstly there is a toggle lock shift button this button is easy to press by accident and since it is not a momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian interupting game play also buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb and quite far from normal thumb use i had a hard time using those buttons quickly also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10. and finally for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back and ill soon go with the logitech
the fm tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations the radio part hence was worthless the speakers are sub standard no depth without the remote little can be done all in all it is not worth trying my cheap 20 year old sony boombox is of much higher quality
i purchased this boombox over a year and a half ago what i do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and playback i agree that it could have been better it would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last you can not forward in the song in format but you can do it with a regular audio cd sometimes i like to hear a certain portion of a song again but i will have to play the entire song again i no longer have the remote and there are some things that i can not do anymore
very dissapointed with this boombox the fm tuner has too much interference the fm is fine if you listen to a strong station but if you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for fm only am the am has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it for example i live in atlanta ga so the strongest am signal is 750 wsb so if i try to tune into 780 wbbm at night i get 750 bleeding through i have had other panasonic boomboxes that have this trouble with am so if you listen to the radio like i do please check it out see what i mean i hope panasonic will correct this on future model
i wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different pcs the first a dell precision laptop with 1 gb memory and a 1.8 ghz processor would capture sound just fine but only color haze for video i thought that it was because the has underpowered usb 1.1 ports so i wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop also memory the best that i got was audio with the sound speeded up voices sounded like they were on helium and the same color haze for video apparently it does n't pay to scrimp in this area i will promptly return the product and look for something better from the other reviews it does n't appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent
like so many others in these reviews i should have read them first ! i can categorically say that this is one of the worst products i 've ever bought it does not work tech support is useless and you should not even try to make it work i am a computer expert with a great computer and there is absoutely nothing i can do to make this work do n't buy
i 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row i 've spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks
this is n't a consistent product 99 of the time i ca n't get it to work after months of emails and phone calls customer service responded what a joke ! they told me the plug in the unit and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in gim me a break ! i should n't have to do the hokie pokie just to get it to work by the way their process did n't work poor product poor customer service poor price
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix camera but the fuji and sandisk product did
these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration ! ! otherwise the speed is no different from a card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration ! ! very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity at the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !
just purchased 3 units thought they would work as well as the novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range my original novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn these only work in the same room i am attempting to return these currently
i just purchased a set of two 4 channel westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently if i tipped one of the units it worked sometimes as though it had a bad connection i am trying to return them now to the seller good luck if you purchase a set of these they seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set
i bought a set of four westinghouse intercoms usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and do n't want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people these westinghouse intercoms and i believe the same goes for the novi intercoms require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit that is controlled by the same electrical breaker so if your kitchen family room master bedroom and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system the westinghouse system will not work for you intercoms are usually for large houses large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets hence this product likely will not work for most people i replaced the westinghouse intercom system with one by another manufacturer called the wirefree intercom reporter this is a four channel system and it works great works either with batteries or transformer it is independent of the electrical circuits
this is not technically a review although based on what i 've read i do plan on buying one of these however i found something on which will the two main circuits that most houses have thus allowing devices like this and work from any outlet to any other this is not yet tested by me but is at least promising device is here http explanation is here http
i was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to budapest when this card died i was using my new canon rebel xt which had no problems with my 1 gb cards throughout my 17 day trip i lost an entire day of photos i would not recommend this product to anyone
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
i bought four of these and returned them immediately two were dead out of the box a third had horrible sound after searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products i finally settled on the 900 megahertz wireless intercom from radio shack beautiful sound well made and about half the price of the reporter pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet so if you need more than 300 feet for range it 's something to consider better warranty than the reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year anyway i could n't be happier with the rs intercom i just ca n't recommend the reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty
i replaced 4 novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 reporters attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter i was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands unfortunately the quality of the reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions do n't waste your money
bought this from amazon worked well for compact flash cards always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card from kodak camera so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera and all of a sudden it died on me had to throw it out
i received this as a christmas gift and while it 's compact there are a couple of major flaws the power button is the only thing on the remote that works none of the other controls on the remote work second it 's very basic i would have preferred something that had some sleep '' or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control the only positive comments i have about this are that it 's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf and it charges the ipod really quickly when it 's docked otherwise the sound is mediocre and the controls suck
i bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas with this in mind i have to say that i found the sound to be poor even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak i did like the fact that it accommodated my older generation ipod and had several attachments for the various versions of ipods i bought it because it did accept my older ipod and because of the price but i sent it back and bought the which has great sound and accepts my old ipod for a price that is not that much more
i tried to install the driver on my computer the computer went into a loop just booting shutting down and rebooting i was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point i 'm scared to try it again any body want it i 'll sell it cheap for that matter just pay the postage and it 's yours
i got this from jnr this unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it i tried this on multiple computers may be this was just a lemon i will exchange it to a better brand
i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room the sound is and it has no battery backup lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing it is also very big taking up my nightstand the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live this morning i finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trash i wo n't miss it at all
too many disadvantages 1. no battery backup 2. even on the brightest setting the clock are barely visible from the distance 3. you 'd be expecting better sound from this unit it 's acceptable with the radio but cd sound quality is extremely poor 4. etc
this bookstand despite the description is not suitable for heavy books if you put heavy books on this the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off
its made of flimsy plastic and all the parts snap on i 'm afraid to put a heavy book on there because i 'm sure the parts will just snap off
looks slick decent sound and great price but flimsy attenna and cd player broke after 1 week on its own i did n't even open it up after loading in the first group of cds took it to jvc repair and they could n't fix it or find out was wrong ruined my impression of jvc remember the wisdom you get what you pay for ''
pros it 's pretty cons it 's garbage sure wished i had checked here at amazaon before i bought this i ca n't believe jvc put out such garbage ! so many of these cd players have broken that they ca n't keep up with the replacement parts 5 week wait ! ! i guess i was one of the luckier ones mine lasted almost 2 months before it died bottom line if you have n't bought yet look elsewhere if you have keep your receipt and warranty
like many others here my died after a couple of weeks and it would n't read any cd it 's in for repair but they say the changer part is on national back order and they do n't know when they will be available no surprise i guess given the number that are breaking the jvc parts web site says the changer is not available for more than 3 weeks '' i hope they will replace my unit with something that works
great appearance and sound jvc has produced a nice sounding unit speakers look as great as they sound no problem handling bass at loud levels tuner is very easy to use usb input works flawlessly now the bad news the cd mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any cd whether store bought or burned first unit died after three weeks the replacement lasted five cd player mechanical design is unable to handle light use will think twice about buying a jvc
i had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds the sound quality was good but the dependability of this item is questionable
the sd slot stopped working last night very frustrating the compact flash card slot still works though i noticed a reviewer mentioned that it did n't work with their sd card it did work with my transcend sd card
tried to use fujifilm xd cards type m does n't recognize them still trying to resolve situation with lexar they say that despite package claim of xd compatibility another reader model is needed
buyer beware this reader does not work with large sd cards i could not get it to work with a new 4 gb sd card my 1 gb cards work fine but anything over that will probably not work i confirmed with with lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
i purchased this memory card for a camera i was also purchasing it was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page when i received the card first and then the camera i was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit because i had opened the plastic package to the card i was unable to return it in fact when i emailed the company who sent it i never even received a response
grossly and useless sony 's 10 headphones sounded just as good the headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best
i was so excited to get this for my ipod i love listening to my music in my car but was really disappointed when it would n't fit into my 2003 gmc envoy there are two cup holders in the front and granted they are in weird spots but the tunedok would n't fit if i put it in the front cupholder it would interfere with the gear thing and if i put it in the back cupholder i had no where to put my cups plus it interfered with the box
i thought this would be a great buy but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy screw that
i am the type of person that always buys the extra warranty on whatever i purchase however i started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still had n't received their refund check i was astonished i contacted myself and asked them about this with no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps i was informed that if i did everything by email it would take at least 15 business days that 's three weeks ! to receive my refund check after i sent them the warrantied item if i had them send me a label for the defective item instead of using my own printer it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item in other words it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks ! i cancelled the contract immediately it is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract i would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as grado sennheiser or koss but stay away from these people that 's my feeling and my advice
i paid for it and got an link but have yet to receive the written conformation called the 1800 it 's been a month if it 's this hard to get the plan i wonder how it will be if i need to replace my product
do n't buy this product there simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase since it was 30 days outside the warrantly apple support told me sorry tough luck '' i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong ! second ipod just died same battery problem this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and of course by the time i got in i was past the 12 month warranty period who keeps track of the purchase date i sure did n't other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year it is a fantastic product i 'm just sorry that it did n't last twice ! cause otherwise i 'd be a fan
never seen a worse less intuitive inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that itunes apples is up to it 's usual standard that 's precisely why i prefer not to mess with it
i had the same experience as the reviewer on i tested the ups by shutting off the power at the breaker within a minute the ups software shut down the computer i had set for 4 minutes so obviously the battery was n't going to hold up long only load was computer monitor and router at any rate the shut down was successful but upon about 30 seconds into the reboot the ups beeped and cut power to the outlets which killed the computer and killed the router for a second or so absolutely worthless as the whole reason i wanted the ups was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips i have here
most people buy a ups plug it in and never test it to make sure it works i tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage i set it to shutdown windows after 1 minute only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it after power was cut it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down then i restored power to the ups after about 30 seconds it beeped clicked and temporarily dropped power to the computer while it was rebooting ! so when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted that is unacceptable a ups should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it
i would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime under a load it only lasted 3 minutes while the es 500 lasted almost 12 minutes the es 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime in my opinion this ups is only good for very small loads less than the average computer
i do n't own this specific apc product but i do own other apc products my home was hit by lightning on july 2 2004 during a severe lightning storm both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate power line surge protectors made by apc surge protectors offer the best damaged equipment warranty that apc offers apc refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination the surge protectors are functioning properly i had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs i will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike but the apc warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs i now do not recommend apc equipment since their warranty is worthless
if you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet your unit will not be covered by the aps warranty on this device lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried the cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with aps they denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage even though the modem was n't hurt

i am still awaiting resolution of a problem i have with these drives in writing dvds i get verification errors this proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure the drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the ide bus but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire
also import a cd money down the drai
the drive arrived at the end of december was quick to get up and running and worked fine until yesterday then it got the machine equivalent of lockjaw '' and i 've been unable to get the tray to release so it 's a good drive while it operates but i 'll probably make sure i pay for at least a warranty on my next purchase as far as my recommendation goes it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one 's drive fails yesterday i just went to a backup burner and kept working if i had needed to get the job done and i had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy i 'd have been in a seething rage computer hardware is never 100 reliable but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year
i never even traveled with it it just stopped working completely making me lose data never again i 'll buy anything from this company this drive is a piece of rubbish !
when i paid somewhere between 30 a couple of months ago for the optifix pro kit i made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners i 've owned before the package 's description made it seem promising enough and i 've had mostly good experiences with memorex in the past so i just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home after reading the instruction guide carefully before use i 'm positive the product was being used properly but unfortunately the optifix pro just could n't deliver the goods in fact not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs i inserted it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair ! what 's more frustrating two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable i hope fellow cd collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular memorex product
i bought mine at for 20 followed the instructions with two scratched dvd 's from the library one badly scratched the other still playable and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability it 's going back in the morning this model relies on an aluminum oxide paste superfine liquid sandpaper to sand off the scratches i think i 'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc for cleaning just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol they work just fine
i was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and work well it was played with once and a while for about a month total 10 hours max some time after that the next time i went to use it it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick i could not get it to center or even stay still it would just keep either steering the car like or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what i tried it several times and it has never worked since i fire it up once and a while to see if it 's still doing it and it does i am very dissapointed in this and i was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the logitech controller i think i paid about 45 locally for it and i just bought a pelican extreme edge from radio shack on clearance for 19.99 that works and feels as good but is less than half the cost i do n't really feel like going thru a warranty claim if it 's even covered but it still annoys me every time i look at it in my xbox 'drawer ' of extra stuff i was going to go totally wireless 4 units and luckily did n't run out and buy 3 more of these logitech controllers i instead bought some extra microsoft s controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there if the pelican holds up model version 2.0 i might go get some more if i can find them locally
i am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it this is a horrible controller i mean it works well for maybe like a week or two in that time you love it but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with the triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment i swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity i 'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger is n't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade it can spoil a good game of halo in an instant occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver which takes about 10 dear seconds after the contoller started breaking down i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air this controller is and do n't bother picking it up
i bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when it 's on my lap sitting in a chair i 'm very satisfied with it 's being able to accomplish that however the cord ended up breaking after a few months targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle now one of the two fans has started making a racket when i first turn it on after a bit it settles down but very noisy at first
i use a laptop since i am always on the go i noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time i thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop it works and the quailty of the product seems to be great but it really does n't do much if anything at all i think the idea of the cooling pad is great but not effective
you 're money is better spent on another product it 's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made a nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet damn near silent if it is n't damaged i had one fan made a scraping noise the fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop but i 've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in
this product is cheaply made and noisy the usb power cable developed a problem after 30 days do n't get ripped off avoid this unreliable product
i 'm a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuai and have owned several previous models of wacom tablet for the life of me i just could n't get the working on my mac at all the installer crashed kernal panic ! my otherwise rock solid tiger installation downloading the latest driver from wacom 's web site was only marginally useful the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how i adjusted the control panel and even moderately fast motion caused it to submarine '' from one side of the screen to the other wacom 's sparse faq suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away it did n't work and besides i have no plans use the tablet from across the room phone support was no better wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff july off ! too bad it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it looks like my trusty workhorse tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service if this is the level to which wacom 's legendary tech support has fallen
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix camera but the fuji and sandisk product did
i 've not found anything from memorex that works right try maxell products from amazon you ca n't find better products and the best customer service on the net
i purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows i could n't wait to get my hands on would n't i it 's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread at first it looked like a really cool product and is if your system is a mac logitech has done a great job of selling the nulooq to windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on there is no tooldial for the windows version a fact that they do n't disclose which is probably the most powerful feature of this product i now feel as though i have wasted my money on what is a useless tool if you have windows and been totally conned by logitech what is even worse is the fact that logitech do n't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for window users so if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you i know where there is one for sale ! ! !
i bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today one big caveat on performance however i am running an older 800 single processor mac which although i use it in a professional graphics capacity every day photoshop is a bit pokey by todays standards after downloading tiger which is required for the tooldail app i got the thing going this is what i found 1 evan after setting all the tooldial prefs to the fastest speed i got slow and jerky navigation the nav ring overshooting the area i wanted to see because of a delayed response also to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press with a firm pressure on the far side of the ring which requires a repositioning of the entire hand poor ergonomiics in my opinion seems like they went for a sexy instead 2 an ipod type dialing motion is fine on an ipod but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in brush size etc and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad 3 the trigger points funtion but require surprisingly heavy pressure to operate at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click this kind of treatment 8 hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week there may be a device out there that will someday revolutionize my workflow '' but this isnt it back it goes
the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years it lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card it worked just fine for days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable cheap yes but cheap junk
the dvds are a although i 'm counting on the rebate to at least break even not counting my time the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk i 'd recommend verbatim 's dl product made in singapore as a note i can get other to work just fine i have n't submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments
i tried 4 dvds with different dvd writers and still does n't work this stuff is junk in addition the manufacturer never sent the rebate do n't buy anything from velocity
at least for my sony dvd burner in my powermac completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot
they have no label on the top hard tell which side is up these are the worst dvdrs i have ever seen and used the speed is much slower than other brand dvdr such as ridata although they are both 3 of 4 dvdrs got errors during burning but other brand dvdrs are 100 i am going to return these package to amazon
you charge too much for shipping and handling i would have been better off going to a retail store
once you get this remote working which i found challenging and i work with computers all day long you 'll definitely like how it works and it 's better than programming in codes the biggest problem is the charging dock does n't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts which means it 's usually dead when i go to pick it up i 've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which both of my have and they 're not even answering last time i called they said many people were having the same problem and all i had to do was squeeze a piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection that solution has n't worked they 're on to something but i 'd wait for a version where they 've addresed this issue
this was everything i looked for in an player but only for about first 6 months about half a year from getting it the headphone input went making the audio staticy and constantly going mono had to send it in for repairs after another months of light use mostly in the car so it 's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets the problem reoccurred had to send it for repairs again a couple of months later after the 1 year warranty expired i noticed that the battery life started to decrease in a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged i nevertheless continued using the unit being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that i charge it every night so a couple of weeks ago about 15 months after purchase it stopped working completely when turned on it gives hdd error '' message resetting does not work the computer no longer sees '' it when it 's plugged in i emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is 195 needless to say that i wo n't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit i really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to model but i doubt i 'll trust this manufacturer again
i bought my in early october of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems in under a year i have sent it back to them twice and i am about to do so for a third time the problem is with the volume it goes from low to loud randomly the volume problem appears to be a defect with the itself i know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem the difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they ca n't fix it this time i wo n't either i think i 'll be done with this company when you read all the things the can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great player but it rarely works
i 've had this since xmas 05. it gave me trouble initially then the problem went away since july it has n't worked for more than a few hours despite cowon 's several attempts to fix it this is the third or maybe now it 's the time that the sound on my 20 gb iaudio has cut out cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago the screen shows that the song is playing it 's just that no sound comes out besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat this is a quibble however that one can live with given the problems i 'm having with it i considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good
just like others have stated the paint comes off the keys after a few months of use you would think logitech would have made a better product
great looking keyboard unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed that includes cleaning and do n't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it the keyboard self destructs after you have the count them and of screws i called their customer support they were n't like dell nobody is that bad but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50 off their retail price shipping was extra so you save maybe 10 off street prices they are no longer the good company they were in the past they need competition so i 'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement too bad they do n't make those old keyboards anylonger
well i ca n't give an honest review of this product because i have n't yet received it i ordered it on june 15 and it was promised by amazon direct not another seller via amazon between june 21 and june 23. so i 'm sitting here on july 15 with no tv it really is n't amazon 's fault it 's the shipper eagle but whatever i 'm less than satisfied with this transaction i have seen the tv in stores and it looks good though
i was using the tape player for my ipod but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck i was forced to go to the fm transmitter i had expected it to be as clear as my radio afterall it feeds off radio frequency i was very very disappointed it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter static can increase or decrease i know it was n't because i had weak radio frequency the other stations were perfectly clear so i blame the transmitter i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it i 'm glad target took it back
i purchased 1 of the old model when i bought my ipod as hard as i tried i was unable to switch stations on it okay '' i thought i must have got the one bad one '' so i called griffin and they were not much help they said that the radio stations '' may have been bad and said i would need to down load new software well no luck it still did n't work and the one station i could get sounded like horrible when it worked at all so then i saw the new version out on the market so i figured i 'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use i bought 2 of them 1 for me and 1 for my wife neither one sounds any good i can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but i ca n't hear my ipod from 4 feet away both of them sound exactly the same they constantly sound fuzzy like they are just not tuned in right '' if you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the itrip then the sound distorts before the station fuzz '' goes away only a fool walks on thin ice twice and i 've done it 3 times now never again ! do n't follow in my footsteps ! please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage
i have had this system for 9 monthis now and i am sure this is the worst piece of av equipment i have ever owned sony is usually known for quality products but it this case i am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market the worst part is that i have had numerous problems with it occasionaly it fails to recognize inserted after you turn it off and back on on other occasions it completely locks up the first time it happened i had to call sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it now after about 9 months of use it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message protect unplug '' the only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes there is nothing wrong with my electric wiring i have checked and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge conditioner i am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it at this point it 's just not worth it because of all the other things i despise about this system first off cds and dvds take forever to load to insert a disk one has to press an eject '' button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk if you missed your chance tough luck start all over second it is a royal pain to use any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be on screen menus a standard on most systems now do not exist and the manual is a joke third the fm radio is awful i went out and spent money on an expensive fm antenna still my cheap clock radio gets better reception fourth there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review finally i do n't share people 's opinion that the sound is all that great it 's average it is way too heavy on bass the wireless feature is nice i admit and that was the reason i bought it but i would not buy it again or probably another piece of sony equipment in a million years now i could live with wires running around my room or even just a system rather than deal with this piece of junk shame on sony for slapping their name on this lemon
i ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here big mistake upon setting everything up it all worked great for about two hours then the dreaded '' screen came up now it wo n't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode and no it 's not a short in the wires or overheating it protects even when stone cold and with no speakers plugged in i called sony and they say it is a short in the box so now my two options are to unhook everything repack exactly the way it came to me and reship back to the online store i bought it from with enormous hastle and expense or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center which happens to be across town and only open so much for being convenient this thing is brand new and already needs repairs ! ! on top of that even out of the box none of the video inputs worked audio was fine but video was dead as a doornail right from the start and even on top of the fact that this machine came broken it sucks even when it works right ! the dvds take forever to load and it comes with hdmi out but no hdmi in ! so if you 're an hdmi user i hope you have multiple hdmi inputs on your television one for your cable box one for this crappy system this is a piece of junk for the love of god do n't waste your money
i 've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it has n't work since day one some dream system the 'authorized ' repair center is a total joke as well after being at the repair center for 6 weeks i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that i need to send it back to sony in texas i get to pay for the boxes packaging material and the shipping yeah ! ! ! ! and i have n't even watched a movie ye
the sound on this system is really fantastic for the price but i 've had the same experience as the other reviewer the dvd skips constantly and phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50 credit but phillips insists that i send at my own expense the machine to them and then wait weeks to have a 'possibly ' refurbished unit i 'm quite disappointed with phillips and its lack of customer service
this system is quite sleek easy to fit in a cluttered living room assembly takes about two minutes the instructions are very clear the sound is amazing especially when you put on your favorite loud film why then do i give it one star it skips like nobody 's business at first my wife and i thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched but then we put in new disks no difference when exactly does it skip impossible to tell sometimes a little sometimes every frame ! sometimes it 'll tell us that disks are bad then the next time we put them in they magically work until they skip so i called philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping but they could not guarantee that they would fix it and it would take up to a month before they 'd ship it back save your money ! buy from someone else
why would you want this item amazon is charging 50 more on this item than the generation shuffle ! and according to what i have read this shuffle is n't very derable it does n't even last a year ! i do n't know about you but i 'll get a generation shuffle
one day it just stopped working i got the dreaded orange and green flashing lights of death '' the contents of the file space were and i ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that apple likes to keep
thank goodness for apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year warrenty and then die i would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed 100 dollar ipods
my shuffle suffered the blinking lights so i took it into the apple store a salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he could n't do anything and said i would have to sign up for a appointment at the genius '' bar at that appointment the genius '' said he could n't fix it and because he said he did n't know anything about engineering he could n't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both apparently being an apple genius '' does n't involve understanding how things work though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut the 'genius '' then offered a 10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle but could n't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing perhaps it should be retitled the idiot bar
i got my first ipod shuffle about a year ago it lasted til the following may and then started to act weird the lights would flash and it would crash my computer but would n't play music took it to the apple store they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty the new unit lasted a few months and then it also bit the dust in the exact same fashion as the first one i 'm gentle on my ipod never dropped it left in the hot car etc and yet they both have died on me i 'd recommend the creative zen nano it 's cheaper much easier to add songs to no itunes required and has a small screen that makes it more navigable not to mention an integrated voice recorder and fm tuner
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
recieved as a present from my wife poor girl got sold on this thing at circuit city anyway it was alright pretty average transmitter the thing broke immediately after it 's 3 month warranty expired i contacted dlo 's customer service and they were rude as heck i understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all would n't even offer to fix it if i covered the costs so basically i have a useless piece of plastic and electronics i bought a monster icarplay and have loved it it 's put together much better better sound no annoying little issues and a more reputable company do n't spend your hard earned money on dlo get something that will last
first off the ipod jiggles no matter what you do secondly it does n't stay straight on the power plug it constantly tilts the whole thing not worth 10
application is dual input from cable tv input and analog pc input used as side monitor on a triple screen home computer workstation 1 audio output stops intermittently a few times a week requiring power to regain audio 2 there appears to be no way to disable unused source modes to switch from computer input to tv input requires one push of the source button but then to return to computer input requires 4 button pushes as the tv cycles thru av component modes and finally back to pc mode a weak design the unit should recognize which input is enabled it is not possible to hook up all 5 modes this is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a monitor picture quality is acceptable for the application which is primarily watching news channels while working at pc or displaying dual pc applications
maybe if these were high end rechargable nimh this would be a reasonable price but for alkaline this is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell you can find aaa battieries on amazon for a third of this price
while i am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me i am a little disappointed i 've had this thing for a couple years now about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound so i went back and replaced it they did n't even ask what the problem was they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements then over the past few months the dvd player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever i use it i have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it and now the player has stopped working completely i have a dvd in there that i ca n't get out which for the record is part of a sopranos season they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace bose failed me once shame on them they failed me twice shame on me i 'm gon na go with something else
seller 's for an honest review go to the correct page for the bose 321 graphite accoustimass module and two satellite speakers that will have the correct retail rate and draw the true this price of 700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here i hope this helped you in your endeavors and i look forward to competing with you in the future ! buyer 's buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or mistakes '' on the sellers ' part in contractual agreements to amazon customer service because if this ad by that is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system 2 satellite and 1 lrg acoustimass you are in for a steal ! literally so get a goin ! lol disclaimer this review is an posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description which is it 2 speakers or 3 in this advertisement for above mentioned product why is n't bose listed as a seller ! doh no slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true
i do n't dispute that bose is a leader in speaker technology but there is a reason this item is discontinued it locks up when playing certain dvds sometimes after selecting play movie '' it wo n't get past the menu you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen other dvds will play fine but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the dvd the next time you turn it on it will say bad disc '' and locks up you ca n't play you ca n't eject nothing you have to unplug it and essentially reboot the system maybe i got the lemon i do n't know but it 's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name bose this system is definitely an exception to that rule
i bought this 18 months ago and while i had some problems with the set up i got help from the store where i bought it it has really nice sound but it has a serious problem not once but twice when my children inserted dvds in the player they would not eject ! since no one could service it locally i went to 3 places and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they could n't since they would have had to open it up i had to send it to bose that cost a lot plus bose charges a minimum of about 240 i forget the exact amount to even look at it now the exact same thing has happened this is the second episode ! they say you can repair this easily but i went through the recommended procedures with a bose technician over the phone and it did n't work there 's no way i 'm sending this machine back to them i 'm getting something else ! any recommendations finally lest you think the kids are somehow to blame let me note that they work daily with other dvds cd players and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them i normally do n't like having to pay extra for a warranty but if you insist on getting this product i 'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty
the 2.0 gb sandisk cruzer micro flash drive looked like a good deal when i saw it on display at office depot it was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files was rated for usb 2.0 and was reasonably priced my first choice would have been an larger version of the 1.0 gb iomega i use at work but alas such was n't available unfortunately i waited too long to put the sandisk through its paces or i would have tried to get a refund as many others have remarked it is horribly slow while backing up my roughly files i found that it was taking about a second per file longer for the big ones this translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation bulk deletes take just as long to carry out using my beyond compare file synchronization software to the sandisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast until for no obvious reason it hung on one particular word document this evening i could n't even get my windows xp machine to shut down without yanking the sandisk from its slot the usual safely remove hardware '' operation would n't work after three attempts to read the same file and three reboots i tried to delete it from windows explorer and this operation hung too finally i was able to do the deletion from the dos prompt just like 1985 ! i then recopied the file and now beyond compare can finish its work without a hitch but can i trust the sandisk to deliver up my precious files when i really need them i dunno so it 's back to the drawing board maybe by now iomega has come out with that 2.0 gb model as for the sandisk i 'm reminded of that painful adage you get what you pay for ugh
bought this about two months ago never liked it for two reasons rubber cap is so easy to lose guess that 's why it comes with spares though slow ! this is what was most uncomfortable with the drive yeah it 's slow only with groups of small files like everyone else said still it 's annoying to have to zip a bunch of small files everytime before you copy them over to the drive then unzip when you want to them not practical and now well it just stopped working last week i mean completely for no reason just great like one day before i was going to sell it to someone else stay away from this one
but i wo n't because i paid good money for it as you can see from the other reviews the speed on this thing is pathetic almost to the point of when it comes to many small files i had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder it took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder makes you wonder if sandisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing stay or if you really want one buy mine please
i 'm the consumer of sandisk usb flash drives i have used couple of sandisk flash drives mini mini before i bought this product performance wise this particular product is not doing good it 's taking long time to copy files from my computers even it 's taking long time to delete files from this disk so i returned to amazon and looking for mini products from sandisk i doubt all the micro products which is having capacity more than now i 'm planning to buy or sandisk mini usb flash drive better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product
i bought this flash drive like a month ago and it stopped working just like that ! one day i plugged it in a portatil hp pc and windows explorer didn t respond it s a xp i unplugged it and tried again with the same result the same with the regular pc s where i usually use this flash drive bottom line money wasted being a regular costumer of sandisk i must say im very dissapointed the must frustating thing is that i wont get a refund because the 30 days expired besides it comes with a cheap cover instead of the regular one the 512 micro flash drive so try some other product
the clock itself works well it did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect we set a backup alarm the first night the idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea but why would scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio does n't make sense to me granted i live in a rural area but i am able to receive both am and fm stations from as far away as fresno some 50 miles away on other radios in the house including a small portable one and we do have a local fm station the tuner is so sensitive that i had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station i am unable to receive one am station and i eventually very gingerly dialed in two fairly clear fm stations one from fresno one local but neither stay tuned in morning when the alarm goes off nothing but static a strange thing though once while trying to locate a station i received a fairly clear one from salt lake city ! i plan to return the product
i used to have this same unit under the brand name emerson research '' it 's a pretty good unit but it 's a very old model for the price you can get a much more modern one from emerson research at a local store
i too bought these after not finding spindles of the verbatim dl a few work but only a very few i have an nec recorder which works completely reliably on most media but not these the machine is a dual xeon with of ram so this is not a resource issue sigh
these disks would not work with my sony brand dvd writer i have tried several other brands and so far everything works but memorex
backed up some movies and not even 1 played well they either skipped or did n't play at all i backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files wo n't even open says damaged or corrupted files absolute junk ! i will stick with verbatim from now on
to back up my personal dvd collection i burned 200 discs 100 on these memorex 's 100 on philips 's every memorex had flaws during playback every philips was flawless i 've been buying memorex for years but i 'll never buy memorex again
really liked it would have rated it but last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turn on anymore only the clock works just one month out of warranty from other reviews this seems to be a common problem
i liked this machine while it worked but i started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago i got busy and suddenly the warranty was up and then the other day it just would n't turn on at all i had it for 15 months
overall the recorder worked a moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded dvds could not be finalized for unexplained reasons however that is irrelevant now a few weeks ago the unit stop working i does not turn on at all what a waist ! it is out of warranty now
i purchased this unit about 18 months ago after the warranty ran out the unit first quit working with media then there is an issue with finalizing the dvd which makes the dvd unusable unfortunately this is after you record your show then all is lost it started making squawking noises like something is very wrong it never remembered the language or channels panasonic never did anything about this after reading others with these same issues i would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer
here is the original review of this machine i wrote on june 17 2006 we bought this machine just over a year ago a year and two weeks to be specific we had another very similar panasonic dvd recorder in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch on both for a long time the recorder worked fine recently though it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks ejecting them and even playing them at first we thought this might be because we 'd recorded over the so many times but today we tested one of them in the other machine which has never made any similar noises and the had no problems with it needless to say we 're not happy that the seems to be dying especially since the warranty just ended if you buy or own this machine follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you 're within the warranty period because the noises and problems just get worse panasonic is usually a reliable brand one we 've used for many years but this machine seems to be a lemon we 're actually going to write to panasonic about it i 'll try to post again with the results here is my update which i wrote november 3 this is a review to the one above which i wrote on june 17. i wrote to panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended they sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair including labor of the machine at one of three places they listed the places were all within a drive of my home after doing some research i chose one and brought in the machine they fixed it by replacing the entire internal mechanism '' i do n't know what that means we got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of july it 's now the beginning of november the fixed machine worked fine for a while but in the past few weeks we 've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before i 'm going to try writing to panasonic again and asking for a refund because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it it 's still working but i know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it wo n't avoid this machine again the previous panasonic model we bought has n't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great we 're still big panasonic fans but this particular model is a lemon
i would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months there is a reason the warranty is only 90 days the performance sound quality steadily declines over time the ihome worked great when it was new but it wo n't play songs from the ipod anymore and the radio is a static box
so when i first got the ihome for christmas i loved it well i loved it in spite of the glaring bright light that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep however after awhile the ihome will not register my ipods existence at all today i was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again i would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts this device has become nothing more than a nuisance that wo n't even pick up radio stations so the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled useless
i bought the ihome so that i could choose which songs to wake up to off of my ipod and it worked well when it actually worked after being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off i tossed the item it was n't worth all of the problems to keep at all if i could n't even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning other people have mentioned the too bright display and the gradual volume increase '' which i eventually got used to but i could see how they would be incredibly annoying
we have had ours for almost a year it still works great but there is one big problem the display is a bright light great for visibility of the clock when you need it but unfortunately even when it 's on the lowest setting it lights up our whole room ! my husband sleeps through it fine but i need a dark room to fall asleep and i always have to throw a sweater or towel over it we finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio
i got this for christmas last year i hardly use the thing and when i have i have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it i can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static apparently a short of some sort i was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and read all of the reviews i am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop save your money and buy something else take your time and read through the cotton candy '' reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of and you will see one consistent pattern the connection to the ipod is very poor the alarm does n't function and they feel it is overpriced
i like the features i 'm satisfied with the sound the user interface could be more intuitive however my overriding complaint is that the docking port as many other reviewers have mentioned is not reliable the connection is poorly constructed so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the ipod is n't there any more if they could fix this quality problem it would be well worth the 100 but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just ca n't justify it at any price
no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter the way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or some experimenting i did confirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie
my dell laptop running windows xp did n't recognize the device when i plugged it into either usb port i contacted targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that i should try it on another pc if it does n't work on this laptop i have no use for it there is no cd rom for support drivers and targus support stated that i should n't need any drivers went to microsoft website for compatibility and the device was n't listed i should have researched this before the purchase i would not recommend anyone purchasing it
i bought this for my computer and it is useless the unit does not have enough power to provide back up power to my machine be very careful when purchasing these i would first recommend contacting the manufacturer to see what they would recommend apc has offered to give me a discount on a new one if i use this as a trade in but it would cost me a fortune to ship it tiger direct will according to the website only guarantee items against defect therefore i 'm left with an expensive doorstop do n't make the same mistake research before you buy ! my 19 '' monitor and pentium 4 are too much for the
i mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would protect my computer from being killed but instead this thing has killed my computer for the second time in 4 days emitting an ca n't turn the feature off shriek alarm how do smart talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an that ca n't be defeated silenced in addition to doing far far more damage than it can ever prevent ask yourself do you want this shriek alarm going off in your house at i bought one apc product and so far they 're 100 defective and 100 deliterious to the use of my computer it 's a matter of time before it 's deliterious to my sleep
the hook up and downloading the software was very simple there was a error problem with the drivers my computer is fairly new with windows xp i called there support and was told to try it on another computer i install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened i sent it back to amazon and credit my account and bought an other brand amazon is so great about handling returns
i connected all the cables as instructed but it does n't work the light is not on so i return it to amazon
i was very excited about this unit when i ordered it but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate vbr encoding and the divx recording feature did n't actually work most of the time a blank screen or a green screen was the result unfortunately given these problems i returned the unit i think i 'm going to look at an older ads unit without the vbr feature to ensure quality and then do any divx transfers by software it seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image too bad this one really had a lot of potential
let 's be honest this product ai n't cheap it 's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working i bought mine at delivery was great only took them a couple of days however my cable was damaged the connector to the was for some reason cut in half without it you ca n't recharge or connect the to the pc i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours no response i sent three to cpenusa no response i do n't care if the product itself is great i 'll never know now will if you 're unable to receive support when you need 'em you 're screwed if you 're just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and do n't really care if you 're on your own go ahead and try it let me know how this thing really is otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to support
they would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken
the majority of my cases were damaged in shipping i immediately threw away about eight but as i tried to use the rest i gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well maybe i 'm alone given the other high ratings but these seem more fragile than other slim cases i 've used in the past i 'd give them because they 're cheap if they did n't have to be shipped
this thing is a joke it does n't play loud enough except for low volume listening there is no handle to make moving it easy cheap flimsy construction and a door that you know is going to break soon no battery for the memory i would rather pay more and get something better i am going to return it
rated as 3000 hour bulb life when purchased today they claim 4000 hours bulb lasted only 900 hours service at unfocused '' does not care about creating a satisfied customer base would not replace bulb even on a prorated basis
sure these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but i give their functionality an as soon as i opened one of these cases to put a cd in it the case broke it happened to 3 cases out of the 12 i have used already i was n't using excessive force in fact most people call me gentle buy at your own risk and handle with care !
i 've owned various viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance until i purchased this 2 gb compactflash card it 's possible that this card works well in other uses but i found its performance unacceptable as storage for raw images shot with my canon digital rebel slr anywhere from to of the images were corrupted particularly bad in continuous shooting mode contrast with my lexar media 512 mb and 1 gb cards which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions and without as much of a lag time as the viking card often left waiting seconds after shooting as few as 3 continuous images while the card to recovers ''
read the plan carefully not everything is covered under this plan they will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they do n't have to pay too many exclusions for an everything is covered policy '' do n't waste your mone
i have been charged however i did not get a copy of the policy to date
i returned this contract and asked for a refund but new ignored my first two emails then i called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account i then contacted amazon and they resolved the matter in one day i read reviews for new and most people that actually had to deal with new were not happy the 77 positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product
mouse does not glide smoothly on some surfaces due to the large depression on the bottom of the mouse designed to hold would not glide smooth on rubber mousepad or plastic nor my corrian counter top the idea is good however because when you insert the antenna the mouse turns off this being said it may deserve 5 stars if the correct surface is used
i bought this item like 2 months ago and now it 's broken i 'm sooo frustrated i 'd not recommend buying this item
my roommate 's mouse broke she had the older l shaped receiver and i thought it was because she 's bad with technology but i 'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment and even mine broke a few months later i had a straight receiver it just gave up on me not a battery issue more like a connection issue now i read all these reviews about it breaking on people well i 'll write back when my other roommate 's break and when my cousin 's break do n't get me wrong but it was great while it lasted less than half a year gon na go back to my logitech that never broke on me
i have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken the l '' shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem i will call it a receiver it you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break over time the receiver does n't receive i would not recommend this product it 's better to have a straight receiver
the chare for shipping and handling of this small item was ridiculous ! i would have been better off buying at a retail store
i bought this memory card for my canon sd 200 after using it for approximately 3 months with no problems whatsoever i took a video and the card just flat out broke first the screen said image not available '' and then memory card error '' i tried everything to fix it but nothing worked i lost all the pictured i had stored on it and found it was cheaper and easier to just buy a new memory card instead of paying to get it fixed now i have a panosonic one and i 'm really happy with it my advice splurge on the more expensive card from a reliable brand and it 'll be worth it
this item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of casio exilim camera but was never delivered now amazon wants me to review it so here your
this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you 'd hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod would n't stress the electronics i 'd give this thing 5 stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good
it made little notable difference or improvement i would not recommend this product for small scratches and it only makes minor improvements to anything more serious
luckily i did n't pay a penny for the motorized skipdr as it was given to us as a prize '' i have the original manual skipdr which worked every time and i always end up using it instead it has more than paid for itself in repaired cd 's 20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang the motorized version did n't come with any deep scratch sanding pads which i need about 25 of the time for a badly scratched disc most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine and wo n't start turning so i have to squeeze it together to make it work
i just ran my first and last cd through the scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when i started did n't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own it really is worse than when i started
i foolishly placed my irreplaceable 200 dvd in this machine as instructed the result was a disaster ! the machine added visible scratches and made playback worse not better suggestion if you have valuable cds or dvds send them to a professional repair service that uses professional equipment do n't mess around with cheap junk
i will make this review very simple no matter what features you find attractive about this remote its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable unless you have large hands you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it in terms of features the remote has only the simplest of learning '' features if you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it does n't have a code for good luck
this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv which can not turn the tv on and off
i have two chargers and sony batteries wo n't charge in them they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers they force you to buy their own charger that probably wo n't again charge other brand batteries and of course this is not mentioned anywhere no wonder these batteries are the cheapest do n't waste your money or support sony 's attempt to bring products into a standardized market soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough
i have used this mouse for 3 months with my laptop and general use are fine for short periods of time 1 hour however i am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem intermittently after the mouse will go into a move to the left '' mode and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen sometimes it will move to the this is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable i will often at least 10 times in a 30 minute period have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing frustrating if you are trying to click through a menu for instance another example is if you working on any or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time mouse will move when it feels like it it was ok for a while but now it is annoying going to buy a replacement if i have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life it gets no more than 2 stars it could be just this one particular mouse but then that points to lack of qa at the manufacturer end again 2 stars
i purchased this for my laptop it worked great at first there were blue and red lights that would brighten up when it was awake not anymore the blue light completely stopped working it used to be plug and play not anymore basically it is useless it just does n't work it was used probably 30 times at the most complete junk i like the smallness and shape of it though time to try a different brand
do n't purchase this if you 're expecting to get a 1500 mah battery they sent a 1300 mah digicom battery instead
with a full charge it does not last more than could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera canon the original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge initially i thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all i 'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too
i read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport and low ambient sound headpohones without breaking the bank i 'm on a plane frequently i wanted something that i would n't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels i found that the uneven cord lengths are very especially if you like to use only one plug like maybe at your desk at work the weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite even when sitting still so then i thought these will be great workout headphones wo n't be upset if i break or lose them however the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand the effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience even when you are sitting stationary at your desk it is similar to wearing a stethescope which defeats the point of wearing headphones which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise i do not recommend these headphones because of this stethescope i could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses they are after all designed to wear behind the head i 'm on the hunt for better quality headphones
once again i 'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product these are terribly uncomfortable for my ears and do n't really provide that great of listening experience the frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds '' and then they become distractingly uncomfortable but of course this is just my experience your mileage may vary as they say personally i found my apple ipod 'phones to be better
as most anyone will tell you these speakers do have excellent sound and if you 're just going to set them up on your desktop then i 'd give them 5 stars however the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you ca n't them logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no universal speaker mounts '' will work with them if you want to see how they mount go to logitech 's website go to product support and enter wall mounting some might argue that they 're computer speakers not home entertainment center speakers but for 300 i expect a little bit better design
i am disappointed in this product i was suppose to write to you from the weekend my two rear speakers just stop working and also my remote control i have replace the batteries but still does not work i do n't have any other rear speakers to try on the system pleasy me what to do thank you epiphane flaviu
while the verbatim has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players
this media did not work on my brand new asus burner even after updating the firmware
i had so many bad burns with my first spindle that i had to ask for an exchange the new spindle had at least 5 bad burns too also the edge of the disc was n't rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside never again will i buy memorex discs dvd cd or otherwise
one out of every 4 discs would fail on me when i 'd burn to this media at slowing down the burn to did n't help either ! i own a sony with the latest firmware memorex is n't on their compatibility list lesson learned check the compatibility list before buying
use maxell or fuji disks they work flawlessly
i 've had several upss now for a while belkin ups quit after about 3 years of work i understand that this may be long enough but i have several from apc and they are still working one ups i think now has been in service 7 or 8 years
buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the tv you will be left on your own to sort it out amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email run around ! ! bare that in mind before making any large purchase may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back
unit apparently does not work with older magnavox vhs wasted my money
can capture analog video and produce 's but i expected the ability to produce dvd
i was trying to duplicate tapes and the ads tech video express is not a viable solution it drops frames and there are nothing that can be done to improve its recording the installation is buggy i ended up buying a sony and am extremely happy with it
i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd worst frame rate capture and audio capture of 's of the four different devices i have tried completely unusable the software is a trial version instead buy the ads dvdxpress for a bit more ulead 's software is stable and it 's not a trial version it is also the only analog capture device i have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture pinnacle 's dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy
i purchased gigbit 3824 extermely bad on gigabit many errors with applications exchange server remote desktop loop in network ultimately replaced it with linksys much excellent performance i am happy no
here 's a quick comparison for my wireless mouse duracell 1 month memorex 2 days do i have to say anything else
i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term risky cells it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i'm not willing to chance it again
if these were free i 'd still would not recommend them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings it is the discs i must assume since my burner works fine with other brands anyway now i think it 's best to invest a bit more and get good
the first cd in this pack was damaged even before writing well i was able to write the second one without issues hope the rest of them would be fine too
i 've got a dvdrw burner revision in my fast mac running os x tiger and burning with toast titanium 7. although my burner is nominally it only burns at about in my setup probably due to the slow ata 33 bus it 's on i 've used a number of different brands of and disks both and and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2 so few in fact that i often do n't bother verifying video dvd 's anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs i always verify data dvd 's since errors in those are not ignorable but with memorex i 've gotten about 20 failures including a couple of aborted burns ! in one case the disc had a blank band between two burned ones ! the memorex discs i 'm referring to have manufacturer id cmc mag '' according to these are sold under at least 7 different brand names the reviews there are rather mixed which is not imho good enough ! i have not btw have had any problems with the memorex discs i 've tried but i stopped using them because one of my players wo n't recognize the format
i have used three other brands of and none of them have been problematic with my new tivo dvd burner this is the first brand that just has n't worked these discs were a waste of time shopping for they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns and they were a waste of money i am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the amazon marketplace since it would n't be fair to other buyers for your information i have had no problem with sony fuji and verbatim
it gave me format errors out of the i returned it to tiger direct for an exchange and got a refund instead not to happy about paying all the shipping costs for nothing
i thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old which was a bit big for my new smaller room but i was the minisystem is truely mini '' and inferior in quality to the older which was around 280 and was well worth it this system does not deliver the 320 watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room moreover it lacks an auxilary and game sync so you ca n't hook up your tv ipod or xbox to
this model was intended as a replacement for my and yet quite functional panasonic stereo this is the kind of thing that happens when you browse amazon while drunk late at night unfortunately with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality the sony is in all respects inferior ergonomics appearance and above all fm reception which is laughably poor do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver hiss abounds several local stations i heard previously are now unreachable and to top it off sony has stuck with their habit of using proprietary connectors so when i went to plug in an antenna to get better reception i found a weird little plug that i had n't noticed when i put the damned thing together grrr so now i 'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new panasonic with the proceeds death to sony
i bought this thinking failures due to normal wear and tear '' which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page would include accidental damage such as dropping however the pdf indicates that 3 damage from accident abuse misuse introduction of foreign objects into the product '' is not covered this is just an extended manufacturer 's warranty a call to customer service confirms this damage due to accidents are not covered save your money
i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years i purchased three for my mac and pc at home then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit currently only one still works ! i have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down my mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd i ca n't comment on other ups brands such as belkin but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc 's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand my experience over the past four years has been mixed these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries prices vary from 15 to 50 depending on the vendor battery life depends on many factors so i do n't begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable i bought apc branded batteries and ca n't explain why the recurrent failures i 'm frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups
this thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and i constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place the slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the hold '' feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off the little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and i was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod i finally just gave up on it and returned it i bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag i think i 'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options was this thing even meant for the gen 2 nano
while the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice feels grippy but not sticky if you know what i mean some of the features are just wrong for instance the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off also for whatever reason the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out the armband is satisfactory at best it 's just a standard no frills velcro armband
your rebate submission has been received unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons request postmarked after close of program deadline required postmark before actual postmark there was absolutely no submission deadline given except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase all were followed to the t '' i submitted the rebate immediately after i received the merchandise from amazon give me a break i 'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10 ' pole if it was not so piddling an amount this would be worth reporting to fcc but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops probably for nothing more heartache just forego rebates send viking back to the boat and purchase another brand
not a bad little unit wish it remembered where you were on the cd when you turn it off like other units i 'm used to especially since it does n't really shut off '' but goes into '' mode not as much power as i thought it would have for 30 watts would be nice if the aux jack was on the front not the back speaker 2 output would be nice simple little unit works fine so
he did n't send me the product that he was selling the keypad is not usb and also it was n't new and also it was n't targus i want my money back or the real product that i payed for
great disappointment plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications i own excel word freehand among others and displayed typed numbers when it did with extra spaces and squared characters should specify in the product description that is not mac compatible i 'm not aware if pc users faced this problem as well
i purchased two ten packs of lenmar batteries of the twenty batteries only 4 would take a charge i used 3 different chargers an energizer lacrosse and a the lacrosse is a charger with diagnostics can display voltage levels individually for each battery it can also 'repair ' batteries maximum capacities etc so can the none could charge the 16 faulty batteries i sent both 10 packs back
i was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack they are rated at 2000 mah but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames my 2 year old panasonic 1600 mah in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots i tried these batteries in my player and even there it wo n't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback it is not that the battery does not hold any charge that it has but it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices it seems to be all right for use in a flashlight a set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight a bit dimly for hours yeah i tested it for the test i had charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration it is not a charger issue i plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but one last tip nowadays the best nimh batteries are made by sanyo it is better to pay 2 4 times for them than for a lenmar trust me
i owned four different sets of nimh aas this was the latest purchase and the first one to stop working i do have decent chargers and never dropped them or anything it actually ruined my day twice very disappointed
this is my second disappointment with linksys products i have purchased this ap to use in ap client mode connected to my netgear wireless router the product comes with no user manual or technical specifications sheet after spending some time trying to set up connection i have found user manual on linksys web site and discovered that ap client as well as ap repeater modes are supported only with another linksys access point it 's not compatible with other vendor 's products when i tried to use it in access point mode the signal was times weaker then my old netgear 's i am getting very good to excellent signal quality from netgear mbps and good to very good 11 to 24 mbps from
we bought this ap to use with wpa enterprise using a radius server and basically it dose n't work at first we could n't get it to communicate with our radius server at all we resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked then authentication worked but we could n't get an address via dhcp we could n't resolve this so we assigned a static address but could n't pass any traffic over the link unfortunately we found the linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless there only suggestion was to try different firmware once we had done this they could n't help any more so basically they might say it works but it does n't tried a different manufacturers ap worked straight away
this product is not for the heavy handed after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs ' on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types
the reader did n't read my minisd i have another reader that does so i dumped the mobilemate and took the lost
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix camera but the fuji and sandisk product did
this gps comes with us map on the sd card and canada map on the included cd but never the twain shall meet by car i 'm a few hours from canada and several days from the eastern us but i ca n't swap out the faraway eastern us part of the map on the tomtom go 300 for a nearby canadian map it 's either all canada or all contiguous us this is a major functional flaw if you live near the border or live further away and like to take trips oh and if you do decide to swap out the us map be sure to save it on your computer first tomtom does n't bother to provide a backup on the cd so if you do n't first make your own backup before changing to the canadian map you ca n't later get the us map back
if tomtom 's maps fail and you submit a bug report the nice support site sends you to teleatlas 's site which promptly closes the support request it took two requests before i realized i was being redirected away from tomtom 's site the real problem is not with the maps which is a good thing but with the mapping engine determine how to find a point on a map i submit the request to the main support group only to have those bozos close the request saying that the problem is with the map at this point i do n't care who is wrong since neither tomtom nor teleatlas will say who owns the mapping engine this stupid device failed when i needed it the most driving in new jersey ! the tomtom go 300 can not map roads that are broken see bug submission below for more information so why two stars it fails when you need it i could scroll around the working map and find the right street but then i need to stop in an unsafe state er i mean place and use the device like it was my trusty aaa map support does not read bug reports i want that job with zero accountability please ! does it work yes it does and it does work very well when you have a nice clean streets with a good map it does take some time to find its gps often but its tolerable it manages to lose signal with tree cover seriously i can still see the sky moral of this review verify with an online map service before driving to unknown places defeats the prupose no tomtom go 300 did find my way around some detours in nj near trenton and get me into the parking garage saving me time and frustration the prupose of this device updates after using tomtom go 300 for a few months i have seen more problems than i care for i have recommended everyone in my family to not buy tomtom products the map for my area king of prussia pa more than two years out of date it got my dad lost going to a hotel which is 1.3 miles away from me in some areas you will fall off the map the most annoying new feature is tomtom alterate route functions i am headed to a fork in a road in the middle of nowhere tomtom wants me to take the long '' way to my destination by switching from the state route meaning route 1 or route 66 that i 'm on to the another state route at the fork the thing is if i tell it not to take the other state route the damn device will tell me to turn around ! ! once i pass the fork it keeps telling me to turn around when i choose to the routing software from where i am it figures out a new route completely passing the road that i need to take the road is on the tomtom map but it wo n't take it until i get on to it what gives bug report submitted to tomtom tomtom go 300 the mapping engine is broken it can not handle a road that is broken into several sections the city pennsauken gave several distinct streets the same name ! destination 3401 cooper ave pennsauken nj 08109 if you map the destination on any internet site and scroll around you would see that all points map to real locations but are not on the same physical road they are on different roads by the same name in the same city the tomtomgo 300 's map actually has these locations on it but is unable to map to anything but the first occurance of cooper ave 7200 cooper ave pennsauken nj 08109 trying to find the intersection cross street of two streets cooper ave and park ave does not work even though the tomtom 's map clearly shows that they do intersect tomtom can only see the intersection of cooper ave and derousse that area has several other streets sherman ave for example that are also
the tomtom has great features but i returned mine first the maps are very dated this makes it iffy at best it has terrific potential if it worked you can use a pda stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip it 's amazing but i wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it 's internal maps and waypoints but i tried a local test first i used roads as waypoints main roads this way i can force the tomtom to use my routes i did not like it 's choices since it is a dated map database i set up a local route and started to follow it it took me to the first no problem but it would not go past the first waypoint i would go down the road first waypoint then it would tell me to take a u turn ! i did then it said take another u turn it had me going in circles perhaps it 's not made to use roads as waypoints but all indications it gave were that it would the manual was no help support was no help so it went back i have ordered a garmin hope this is i have taken the same trip from se fl usa to sc usa with a garmin the garmin has maps that you can not update but got me to my destination no problem i do n't recommend this tomtom do research go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals hope this helps
i bought the original tom tom go back in november 2004. since then my attempts to reach their customer service have all met in failure my last attempt 10 days ago was an effort to buy updated maps for my product yes their website will offer to sell you maps but there is no way to determine the date of the maps you already own and no way to determine the date of the maps that you would be purchasing in some cases for a large sum of money if you try to find a telephone number on their site that you can call you will be disappointed i am disappointed and would advise you to look elsewhere if you want a product that is supported
i am very disappointed in this product i purchased the blue logger to use with a new dell axim which i purchased to use with the blue logger i found that i could not make a blue tooth connection between the blue logger and the handheld computer i contacted delorme was told at this time we do not offer any support or updates for windows mobile hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe '' what a ripoff delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present pc handheld operating system i have also found that i can not upload routes created on street atlas 2006 to the hand held basically i have a little electronic map with no functionality
i have so for used inav iguidance mapopolis navigon navigator 5 and the blue logger street atlas usa of all these the blue logger street atlas usa is the worst and inav iguidance is the best logger gps hardware is good but v impractical to use bcuz of its strange onoff button i will not recommend it to anyone waste of time and mone
i agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty the button is terrible it takes 5 tries to turn the unit off after 5 months of using this the unit would no longer talk '' with the satellites i sent it back to delorme it tested bad now i have waited 6 weeks for a replacement that is backordered customer service rep will not refund your purchase after 30 days ! the software claims it will compute driving routes for you but it will crash your pda instead i had to buy inav iguidance software which is outstanding to get software that will actually compute road routes for me i would not recommend this product to anyone it has been a complete waste of money for me
it is the year 2005. the century we 've put men on the moon we 've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system we can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets but we ca n't design a simply button the button for the blue logger is one of the most insanely stupid things i 've ever encountered some engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button seconds to turn it on and seconds to turn it off it does n't that difficult to do but in practice it is infuriating especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off right now the blue logger is sitting in front of me and i can not turn it off it simply will not turn off oh and i 've had lots of problems connecting it to my bluetooth adapter and have yet to get street atlas usa 2005 to recognize it
i am trying to get this to work for the last 2 weeks unfortunately without success i bought the bundle 3 bluelogger street atlas 2005 street atlas 2005 handheld the installation went fine but i had problems in hooking up to bluetooth i had to reset my hp ipaq 2215 several times in this process and my ibm 2.4 ghz and with ram was very slow not sure why this was once i got the laptop to work i took the blue logger out for a trip and downloaded the trip when i returned well i coud n't make sense out the data the blue logger logged the waypoints were almost all over the map this was not the route i took i am still within the guarantee and try to return it next week
i bought the blue logger and both street atlas 2005 and hh for my dell no problem with the blue logger gps but my complaints are as follows 1. delorme did not include the blue logger manager software on the hh now they want to sell it separately for additional 39 very weird marketing strategy indeed 2. the software for the pocket pc is very difficult to use not very intuitive it seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc it is poorly designed and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market 3. it is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route even with a 620 mhz axim it is slow worse yet the route is often wrong for example this afternoon i use to determine a route to a friend 's house had i followed that route i would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination luckily i decided to use my paper map later i tried microsoft mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing last week for another location found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off luckily i knew where it was and ignored the routing from hh 4. many other mapping softwares for hh will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger but not with hh after 2 weeks of using it i found myself going back to my old paper map for example if i had not calculated a route and just simply use the gps and map to travel the software only show the street i was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets it does not help when you are lost 5. maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date i guess that 's why delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue i am seriously considering giving up and consider this as my 50 learning mistake and looking at microsoft street trip 2005 or later in 2005 iguidance who is supposed to have the latest map i am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum i wish i had read that forum before buying delorme software well live and learn
i ordered the service plan on may this day july i still have not recievied it i have contacted them a number of times and still nothing do not buy from this company
i purchased this item and one month later i still have not received any paperwork i emailed and have not received a reply
this is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons 1. this hub will not work with any usb powered devices so forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub 2. extremely slow usb this device is not usb 2.0 compliant 3. it is clunky 4. does not comke with a power adapte
wasted my money for this slow hub be aware that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipod etc to this device think again
i have owned this little hub for at least a year i have an older pc which came without usb so i added a pci adapter i soon realized that i needed more ports and more convenience than the two now located in the backplane of the pc on the floor i shopped around and this item looked appropriate as for the short cord i solved that issue by getting a usb extension cord at the same time besides solving the immediate problem this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point and using the extension cord for some other purpose for a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do i attached an external hard drive through it i used it for a compact flash card reader and a digital camera i connected an inkjet printer everything worked once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly this was all with windows 98 se but after a while things started getting less reliable the system would tell me that various drives '' on the flash card reader or the external hard drive were not available or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software and the printer even started disappearing playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life and eventually i deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose or with wiring inside the device either way it has finally become a big problem and i am shopping for a replacement most of the devices i connected were that is they did not need to draw power from the hub or the pci channel at all the hard drive camera and printer were all powered by batteries or ac adapters of their own and the flash card reader which did draw power from the hub used to work fine it does not matter what combination of devices i try sooner or later the connection goes bad it is of course possible that there 's something wrong in the pc but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself so i have to recommend against buying it i suspect it is discontinued and that this advice wo n't be necessary for much longer but i want to prevent somebody from the bother i 've been through just in case
save yourself time and aggravation and do n't buy this product ! i bought this to put home movies on dvd almost every time i downloaded a home movie to my computer the audio was not in sync with the video i spent hours trying to get it right i also kept upgrading my computer thinking that was the problem i finally saw a review here explaining that the is notorious for this problem so i bought a canopus and have not had a single problem !
this amazon listing also suggests buying the soundsticks along with airport express if you 're thinking of connecting them to the usb port of express apple says it wo n't work apple airport express faqs
i purchased the dlo action jacket neoprene for 20 ipods for my wife for use on walks etc around town however the ipod does n't fit in properly the circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod 's does n't the plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and does n't align either so you ca n't press the play button so since the ipod does n't fit in the case overall this product is useless pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case
i have had nothing but trouble with this product no matter how many times i have dowload new or older drivers the installation is never complete their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem though they have tried i will not spend money on another dlink product
install went smooth on my inspiron notebook everything worked fine for 24 hours then it just stopped worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere this thing is junk i 'm sending it back
from looking at the website and talking to five tech support staff it appears that there are countless versions of this card each with different driver software the one i got came with a cd with the wrong drivers with tech support i finally found the 8 mb driver file i was supposed to download however they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver the normal automatic '' approach did not work and their instructions did not match the screens i was getting on windows xp sp 2. so i called back again and again and again despite being given a case file each time i was asked the same questions including what exactly is wrong and each time i was told to do the same thing install from the cd reboot remove the program reboot install from the new driver reboot remove the program talk to a senior tech support person install from cd reboot etc it would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the cd a clearly designed website would be second best and tech support that knows what they 're doing and speaks intelligble english would be a nice last resort i spent three hours calling technical support and speaking to five people and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card ! i am not alone in this experience see cnet 's web site user reviews of the another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system i believe he is right it appears to have damaged my screen font for windows message boxes i have been unable to repair it the is bad news i give them two stars cause they actually have tech support though in this case it was utterly worthless back it goes
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
i have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that i did or else they wrote their review too soon i bought mine in june 2006. it failed before the store warranty ran out one down the replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and would n't boot two down sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free rma that one also failed three down they replaced it with both a and a the hung after about 2 weeks four down i have been using the for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the replacement arrives i have gotten quite good at the rma game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or i get one of those that other people rave about i do n't think i 'll buy another sandisk unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty i suggest that everyone with a failed to exercise thier warranty rights sandisk needs to know the true reliability of their products
after few months of using it it started to lag badly and the scroll wheel stopped working i 'll never buy logitech mouse again
good thing first efficient on battery convenient and up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge thats it as most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low iq software people working in sony utterly non user friendly i develop software for a living and i am not afraid to use new software even though i was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music i had of atrac songs on this player from my computer then one day my computer hdd crashed i was kind of thankful that i had saved atleast 1 gb of music on this bean walkman atleast all the hours i spent in transfering did not go waste as soon as i fixed the new hdd and tried to transfer the songs back to my useless sony softwre will not take the music files back i tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me a very indifferent group of people it is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and i dont want to go abt it is absolutely infuriating
the bean is small battery efficient and has a nice overall look to it thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product this is not an player it is a trac player you have to convert all your 's into trac format before the player is able to play them you also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your hd can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take if your looking for an player that lets you just drag and drop your fav into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you this device is the stalin of player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs
hardware awesome software a flop since you have to use their software the package is destroyed i will give you the final nail on the coffin for me i tried to put podcasts on the device using the latest sonicstage 4. no chance it wants to be able to find each artist '' in the sony library this was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library i had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend no chance now shame as the hardware was
i have an iriver and there is virtually no software to support the usb plug and play interface that mac owners have always expected pay a little more and buy an ipod it interfaces with pcs and macs equally well
i loved this player until the day i really really needed to use it for recording when i discovered that the mode button no longer worked this is the button you need to use to switch from player mode to voice record record or fm radio the device is now permanently stuck on player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat which is not the worst thing in the world except that i specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now for all intents and purposes and 14 months after i bought it too conveniently the screws holding the case together are impossible to remove so there 's no way to attempt a diy solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable problem this thing is of no use to me now a 200 paperweight i 'm never buying another iriver product again
i purchased one of these when new back in 2004. the unit has worked ok for me with the main quirk being about once every hour or two i go through a 3 5 minute period of bad reception presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another i was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from crutchfield my main issue with this unit is that there are newer units available for the same or slightly more money which have replay options and better displays i would consider those options before purchasing this unit
i purchased this receiver in december 2005. it worked like a champ until february 2006 when it began to have issues with decoding the satellite signal the unit works for five minutes from cold start up then the audio cuts out display still shows program info being an experienced pc user i turned the unit off and back on repeatedly the message acquiring signal '' displays permanently even though the antenna aiming screen shows full sat and ter signal bars my best guess is that a rom or ram chip cooked this unit runs hot ! jvc has been less than helpful it sucks to have to landfill a 100 piece of hardware but no one will touch it it 's my last purchase from jvc glad i did n't purchase the sirius lifetime '' license
first of all i thought sat radio advertised commercial free radio '' was that it is not at all ! ! ! ! in fact i spend most of my time looking over the 160 chanels for something not with commercials they claim they have nothing to do with that so this is a good buy if you want another radio player with commercials a lot of them and to pay for it i got this because i was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing so keep this in mind before you buy
i recently bought this radio primarily for my car but also got the home dock it was easy to set up and install both types of kit unfortunately the sound quality was very poor in both configurations the fm modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless it only has maybe 10 channels i found one that was free luckily but even with a clear channel the sound had a terrible hiss that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary the occupied channels actually worked about as well still lots of hiss except when the underlying channel broke through even disregarding the hiss the sound quality on the music was not very good i thought the problem was probably with the fm modulator so i tried it in the home dock connected to a home system the hiss was gone but the sound quality was completely unacceptable for whatever reason this particular receiver does n't like the compression artifacts very much satellite radio quality is at best about like an average with highly compressed signals some channels better than others this receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string telephone '' most of the time it was vert irritating very quickly the form factor about the size of a modern was fine and pretty easy to fit in the car it also seemed to be pretty solidly built but all of that is completely moot if it does n't work properly i returned the receiver and both kits the next day
i purchased for about 8 the replacement plan for electronics products on and after one call on about to the seller i still have received anything john
first of all the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself i did get it quickly 2 or 3 days but i had several problems with it 1 i repeatedly tried it on my dvd player and the player hung each time i had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond i tried over 10 times and got the same result each time 2 i tried it on dvd drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well had to to get my dvd player software to close on the attempt it actually did work 3 i repeatedly tried it on dvd drive 2 on my computer each time i got a message saying no disk '' i consider it item a waste of money
i previously attempted to use this device with my mac pro i run the machine with windows xp and mac os x tiger with tiger the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my aluminum cinema display simply unplug the hub and the machine happily goes to sleep with windows xp the machine does not recognize my microsoft ergo keyboard 4000 until i disconnect the keyboard from the hub then reconnect it ironically the keyboard works fine under os x when connected to the hub i guess i got what i paid for a piece of junk 7 port hub for under 30 i have reverted back to using my port hockey puck '' style belkin usb 2.0 hubs no problems with those
i have no clue what this little thing is about dummy me thought i bought a nice little tv but it reminds me of those little cards you 'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand the image changed that 's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show you can not watch this thing with somebody else seated say 15 feet away from you the other person or you gets a foggy image or just dark shapes up close you see hardly anything buyers beware this is not a working tv one star for the batteries in the remote
i bought this thing because i lost a memory mod to a power surge it worked fine at first but now it has no battery life recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately like it was not on a backup at all of course the alarm was still screaming but so what my computer was already shut off without any warning i had this thing for two years but i will be going with a different brand next time
not functional if you are reading this then you are ! and you and i must be family first i love amazon they are the consistent type of and that 's good ! but but but but why would a designated by me upper echelon '' merchant like amazon carry this sandisk compact flash card type i it simply is not functional information that i stored sandisk compact flash card type i is gone or not readable i am surprised that amazon did not with the problem the product wo n't retain any info then i had to store less and less information on the card so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours i decided to contact amazon they were very shortly and cordially sent me a replacement sandisk compact flash card type i with the paperwork for returning the original sandisk compact flash card type i then i got something that did have the shape of a sandisk cf card did have the sandisk label that says sandisk compact flash card type i and did have the original shiny factory sandisk package 3 different computers later and 2 hour had passed could n't recognize what is inserted into the cf reader the brand new replacement card i got with the original factory wrapping that 's brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers one may safely assume pardon the facetiousness sandisk compact flash card type i is yet to be recognized from amazon twice in the mail i got a sandisk 2 gb compact which flash card type i both cards i received had a problem and therefore it is safe to assume that sandisk compact flash card type i production have a major glitch i mean the memory card can not be used for memory purposes i have to yet see what or for what other than memory can i utilize a memory card i beg your pardon but in essence i am trying to imply that the sandisk products were a joke ! SMILE being the consistent that amazon always been amazon agreed to return them this was not a surprise coming from amazon in essence i strongly urge any person that makes a living and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to 1. not be fooled if you see sandisk run away as fast as possible 2. you 'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so 3. sandisk compact flash card type i is not compatible with data storage ! or even short transfers of data from a home computer to work 4. spend the extra on an alternative brand 5. that 's the only way you 'll get a cf card that is correctly labeled and serve intended functions 6. i strongly recommend as well as urge individual who is thinking of getting that other '' brand of cards to make sure do so 7. use amazon only and do n't be fooled by any other who 's not as high of an echelon as amazon amazon ! 8. had it not been for amazon i would have lost all i paid SMILE god bless amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness i also pray for sandisk so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line god bless and keep on shopping
the second disc in this package was faulty which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best i have switched to maxell
replaced first spindle and still junk will always stick with verbatim from now on
i was deeply disappointed for buying stuff from memorex not a single dvd was usable in the pack never gon na buy anything from memorex !
i bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site i was very pleased with the purchase then i did n't have one problem with the discs i bought another pack recently and i 've been using the pack i just bought all of the discs are messing up for me i can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you i wish i could send these discs back and get a refund this purchase has scared me away from anything else related to memorex i thought memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers i guess i was wrong and apparently you get what you pay for do n't be fooled by the good price you 'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that would n't even be worth using as a frisbee find another brand to use and avoid this brand
the main reason i bought this kit was for the label applicator the software was secondary good thing that i did n't care about how good the software would be because the software for this is in a word deplorable it does n't have support for any other label sheets other than the memorex brand which leaves you stuck with their labels its got some nice features in the software but their poorly implemented for instance it can automatically resize an image to fit a but if you 've rotated it before that the rotation is lost it has a lot of minor quirks like that and they add up to an annoyance to use this if you get this product find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator
i have the older larger version of this product however it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really do n't work right the windows side includes an actual print program which works awfully if you do get this make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint
the labels are sticky on one side and printable on the other but that 's about all this product has going for it the software is a nightmare the print previews only vaguely represent the finished product and the program frequently and randomly alters your image i wound up using the labels but creating the documents in ms publisher what a shame
they totally misrepresent this product it does not work with macs i feel cheated and lied to by memorex shame on you
first of all despite the claim that it works with macintosh it definately does not there is a template that you can use in mac with word claris and other photoshop software but there are no instructions as to how once you think you have it figured out on the page it does n't print the same as pictured the technial support people have no idea how to make it work with mac and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers in any case they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the word template for macintosh do n't waste your money i gave it one star only because no stars is not an option
after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement of course you want a hard copy that is why you bought it just do it
okay this is not a review of the product itself but i strongly encourage you to consider not getting an warranty they are really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things if you had anything to do with the device not working you dropped it forget about it they aint gon na it whatever they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia of course you have to pay for the shipping ! lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know will take months to pay them for the work they did if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it

beware of kingston rebates ! of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product s but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a 50 rebate i promptly as in the day after i received the item delivery went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer think huge online the rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of 1 business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer '' well now what i ca n't the original it was already in their possession i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another 6 weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply would n't honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i could n't really submit to their requirements if you 're looking for a ram upgrade i 'd suggest you look at a quality company like ocz the best ! or patriot geil or corsair if you 're looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams
i 'm not sure what i expected after i purchased this for fifty dollars and was handed a coupon for a 40 rebate but i wish that someone had informed me before i lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voice does n't come through the speaker i 'm cool with the machine 's sound quality when it comes to playing a if i tap the mic i can hear an extremely faint thud so i know it 's on but the volume 's too low and yes i adjusted the mic controls if you want to sing along which makes this a dinosaur a boom box in the age of the ipod really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that had n't been opened so when was my first clue doh
my review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently for some months after i first bought the card it worked great now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my canon elph and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card judging by what other customers have written i 'm suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between canon cameras and viking cards in any case i will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a viking
after serveral months of use card error '' was shown on my canon digital rebel for my viking card which was half full with pictures fortunately i just lost a few of pictures i tried to format the file card error '' kept occuring on my rebel this viking card is now used for my data files probably viking cards are not designed for high mega pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time 3 my canon has no problems when used with the viking card so far probably i am going to buy a card from sandisk or simple tech
i used to like my viking cf card a lot i had such a card for more than a year in that period i used it in my camera it 's filled up for several times also occationally i use a card reader simpletech to that card to transfer some big files between computers it 's all fine and suddenly one day when the card was half full and after a card reader reading i got cf card error '' on my camera fortunately after i delete a few pictures i could move on i gave the card to other people so i do n't know how it 's doing now after that i purchased another viking half year ago i used it to transfer files for a few times and have never filled it up using my camera yet now i am getting consistent cf card error '' message on my camera even after for several times while i do n't have that problem if i use another card one theory i heard was that a card reader may damage a card i can not verify though anyway i will have to buy another card now and it wo n't be viking for this time one month later i contacted with their customer support they gave me a number for return and i mailed back my damaged cf card they sent back a new one in a week the new one is working fine so far the exchange was not difficult they did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt they only verified the serial number that 's good
i purchased this and am not impressed note that works with all click wheel ipods '' is n't true it does not work with photo ipods at least the 60 gb model i 'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit i 'm ordering a 'photo dock ' since i ca n't see any way to get a cover that is made for the model if i 'd known this i 'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately since i already have a charger came with it grr
99.99 list price over 70 actual price you 've got to be kidding ! i never accuse companies of raping consumers because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance if you want to connect your ipod to your home stereo get a 7.00 stereo to rca plug '' at radio shack that 's all you need because you already have a recharger it came with your ipod the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your ipod upright i have this item it came free with my ipod and although it offers a slight convenience over not having it the price is a terrible
this is basically a '' male to rca cable for 73 you could get the same exact cable for 5.99 at radio shack yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out not worth it buy the cable at rs it 'll work exactly the do n't be fooled if you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately you 'll save major
at less than a dollar per sparkly frisbee this is the best price i can find for frisbees they do n't fly very well and they break relatively easily but this is the best value i can find for 100 frisbees in one place a lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable cd media the problem with that is they do n't work very well for that either i too tested this for myself using nero burning rom i tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs just like you 're supposed to it worked ! it burned fine then it took 5 minutes to open a simple html document on the burned disc subsequent trials run with the verify written data '' checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning it 's like writing with a white crayon except this is white paper this persisted on several other computers with different cd burner drives and even different software i finally realized what great frisbees these things are cheer up people they are great fun ! so grab your spindle go outside and start chucking these things at your neighbor 's annoying dog ps i need to sue memorex for selling this junk these disc are just a form of abuse
i purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight my husband and i both used them and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes they were great at first but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears the inside of my ears were so sore i could n't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out that 's how bad my ears hurt i had the foam pad over them too and it made no difference i would not recommend these
i bought this mouse a couple months ago to use with my macbook pro i loved it until a couple days ago when it decided to stop working it 's not connecting to the usb adapter any more i changed the battery and tried the connect button and nothing sad is n't it
being a graduate student and living in an apartment i was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments it prints off things quite well and it is fast it does not however print 500 pages per month pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them the item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition
i detest this printer i 've bought quite a few printers in my day lexmark canon and have been quite happy with most hp 's but this was the pits the first one i brought home worked fine the first time but when i tried to turn it on the next day it would n't cut on it just died on me i unplugged it plugged it back it then it worked for a little while before dying again this time for good i returned it got another one same problem except this time it keeps going all i have to do is unplug it before each and every time i turn it on nice huh now i 'm browsing online again and i 've learned my lesson for sure no more el cheapo models i 'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two
i do n't understand why people spend money on this charger when you can pay half as much for the same thing i bought an ipod charger for my ipod video from sonnet technologies and i am very satisfied it is small and the connectors retract for easy carrying around search amazon for sonnet usb wall charger for ipod with cable '' at about half the price it comes in black or white to go with the color of your ipo
i have a usb ac charger and car charger that came with my palm pda and they work just fine with my nano do n't waste your money supporting apple when it charges 30 for basically a piece of plastic
i record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software i 'd been using ridata for some time next to no coasters but figured i 'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around big mistake they skip pixelate and freeze up i have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies i 've done were it a compatibility issue i could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media i 'm going back to using my cheap disks ! the lesson here is if it works dont fix it !
in each pack there have been several dvd 's that are n't any good too many bad discs in my opinio
it would not download it just stopped about the way through i will have to send it back
it worked file with win but as soon as i switched to windows xp this device was rendered utterly useless to me it wo n't shut down or eject and windows explorer wo n't see it grrrrrrrr
start off with the bad news i have a motorola dvr converter box with my comcast cable service and the comcast remote sends the ads box into gonzo fits attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ads box to switch inputs using the cable dvr button cycles the ads through screen formats with each button push etc i contacted ads tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time obviously this is not acceptable too bad because this box does a much better job than my philips cineos at upscaling tivo analog cable dvd laserdisc all look better the improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle but definitely not worth it if you have a motorola cable box that will conflict 5 stars for video quality 3 stars for user interface which is not so great subtract all but 1 star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict
i bought the ads upconverter because i bought a hdtv only to find out that my cable did n't offer hdtv and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer hdtv too many trees around my house i was n't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing hdtv picture but for i was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable when i first turned in on i asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought she looked at the tv and said okay i 'm ready turn it on i said it is on ! ! '' this is pretty much the reaction i had also when i looked at it the image i got for my digital cable was certianly different but that 's all it was different it was not noticably better in fact in some instances i though the picture was worse i called ads tech support and they kept insisting i try it with my dvd because that is what the product is best for even though that 's not what i got it for so i did and to be honest i really preferred the picture i got directly from my dvd over the picture i got after running it thru the upconverter it did n't matter what display format i put it in it just did n't do anything to improve the picture save your money if you ca n't get hdtv do n't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing
this charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully i thought that my rechargable batteries were out of life '' but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully my daughter brought home a cheap sakar overnight charger when visiting i popped in a set of batteries i thought were done for and found them to be just fine using her sakar charger what happens on my charger is that the lights indicating that the batteries have been fully charged all go off and the batteries are cool to the touch '' indicating that they have been fully recharged nope ! only about half way recharged
i was impressed with the charger for about 1 month it stopped charging the nimh batteries it came with i took it back to best buy only to find that all of the rapid chargers on thier shelf did not work either a sales person and i tested them all hoping i would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked it was more disappointing after calling kodak were unable to replace it or get my money back i thought purchasing a kodak was a smart decision however they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing
while traveling in china i hooked up this charger to a sharper image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking a much better buy would be the sony charger with worldwide voltage and for 5 dollars less
i have two of these chargers that i bought directly from kodak for about 10 each each of them came with 4 aaa batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package one of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use battery charger technology is not all that complicated but kodak does n't seem to have mastered it yet no wonder they were practically giving these away i 'd avoid purchasing these now at any price
i bought this charger 11 months ago it came with 4 kodak 1850 ma nimh batteries after a few months of light use the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 ma batteries should if i use the batteries immediately after charging them i can take about 20 pictures while my 2000 ma nimh batteries can do 60 if i charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves they wo n't be useful after only a week the charger is capable of charging both aa and aaa batteries but a few months ago 1 spring for switching between aa and aaa stopped working properly this was after very light use i only charge aaa batteries once a month the market for nimh batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago i would not buy this kodak if i were to buy today
this worked fine at first but after a few months the charger could not hold the aaa batteries in place the spring mechanisms failed for 3 out of the 4 positions that would hold the aaa batteries thus i could no longer charge the aaa batteries then after a while the charger just quit working all together

i did not read the prior reviews i bought this item loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from the mfg software disc contains two viruses one in quicktime the other in totally hip files target has been notified that the software is corupt with viruses that the mfg has gone out of business this item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no web site access or tech support available for this item
i just recently bought this and when i installed it norton caught 2 viruses on the install cd
out of the past 20 burns i have only had 10 dvd 's burn successfully i use roxio cd creator version 7 which does a great job with my cd 's so i 'm pretty sure it 's the dvd media not only am i wasting all my money but my time as well i 've tried to lower the burn speed but it does not matter i 'd try something else
i purchased this item and was excited to get them but burning my first they 're all coasters ! pass memorex and go for a more expensive media like verbatim
bad bad bad i 'm not sure exactly what is wrong with these discs whether it is flimsy material or an asymmetrical center but they are not reliable i purchased a 50 spindle and from the first 28 used only one worked properly this is an expensive waste i suggest going with better quality discs at the outset it will save on headache later
i would avoid these discs i have been using these discs for some time doing backups recently i 've had a few problems and decided to look at these further i noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the memorex brand as are others like tdk i used to dvd info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by cmc and i 'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors one disk has strange ring in the die i have the nec burner i also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer less trouble playing on my sony dvd player just based on this not a clear indication of what you 're getting when you purchase i would go with something else these discs are not cheap enough for this reason
as far as i can tell this thing does n't work at all i have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them i should have just replaced the cds
i used the repair feature one time and the unit would never turn on again and the disc i did do the repair on still did n't work do n't waste your money on this
much to my dismay the item arrived doa and even tech support was not readily available i eventually filed an rma with the seller but i had to pay for return shipping costs there apparently is no such thing as quality control '' from the seller in an item as simple as this and for this i rate this item such while the replacement works i would recommend others to not buy this until they have tried the soap water '' solution first
not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset '' and work correctly it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand
it did n't work properly from the time it came out of the box the carousel would n't make a complete rotation so cds and dvds would get 'trapped ' inside the unit and occasionally it would simply refuse to play a dvd altogether panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop so maybe they can get it to function as it should if you do purchase one please read the warranty carefully a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones under any circumstances
i have purchased three of these dvd players in the past 2 years every one of them has had the same problems trouble reading dvds dvds skipping discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units the price is right on the unit but not for the time it worked i would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than 6 months without a problem if i could give it less than 1 star i would because thats really what it is worth nothing
i bought this player because i wanted to play dvds from various regions the good news is that it plays discs from all regions outside of region 1 just as well as it plays those in region 1. the bad news is that i never found a disc which the unit could play through in its entirety it would click grind and sputter along for 30 or on a good day 50 minutes before just freezing up save your money or buy a coby which is an infinitely superior unit
this dvd player is potentially a great cheap and versatile machine but the two i bought from worldwide distributers were faulty i have a friend who owns a 300 which works perfectly with my region 2 english dvds i have a cyberhome dvd player in england which works perfectly as well the two machine i received didnt work very well and didnt play some discs at all this is why i would recommend spending a bit more on another machine after returning two players i decided to buy a philips multiformat dvd player with divx windows media support which with a code to allow it to play all regions works perfectly ! it cost 60 with free shipping through amazon so was n't actually much more expensive than the other player ! see the reviews of this player for the code ! i would also like to say that there was nothing wrong with the service from worldwide distributors and that they refunded most of the shipping costs the problem was only with the dvd players they sent me
bad disc error possible fix after about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working i kept getting bad disc error on a new dvd i bought i tried good discs that worked before but now got the same bad disc error this is not the first time i had problems loading previously unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem this time after two weeks of bad disc errors i was about to toss it when i decided what the heck i 'll check inside to see if it 's dirty or something first i unplugged the unit i removed the 6 screws holding the cover you may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off with my expertise knowledge i nudged the lense mechanism it apparently slides to read the discs i plugged the dvd in and loaded a disc again to see what happens the lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc i 'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day ! lol so hopefully this will last a little longer but at least i can use it again for now i am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error the viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers
hi ! i bought my cyberhome 300 in april 2006 and was able to set the region code to 0 '' to watch all dvd 's after not using the dvd player for a few weeks and unplugging it the region code has automatically set back to 1 '' and i can not change it anymore ! what happened when i try to change it now i can only choose between the settings 1 '' and '' anyone who has the same problem thank yo
it came with the stickers all peeling off used it for about a month and the item failed on me then the bad news it blew the fuses in my car and all my electronics stopped working tried it on a friends car and i blew his fuses car and person look for something else seems to be a common problem update linksys replaced this product instantly works but a little worried it will fail again update on update died again
this unit failed to provide reliable power to my new toshiba satellite laptop it cycled on and off every 3 seconds it powered a 100 watt lamp okay but would n't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 and is rated at 140 watts continuous my laptop power supply is rated at input at vac and if it drew constantly i agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter however even at that power demand the inverter should run it for but only manages 3 sec in addition i doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously i talked to linksys support and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund so i did it did not work for me maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts but i would n't recommend it for more than that
the first unit worked ok for about a month but then just stopped transmitting if you unplugged it and plugged it back in again it would work for about 5 minutes and then stop again returned it for a replacement and the exact same thing happened in 2 weeks returned second unit for credit and will buy something else both units had a lot of static even at low to moderate volume level
i bought these headphones to watch tv while on the treadmill they do n't work at all for that purpose interference from the motor causes them to they work great when i stop the treadmill
i was very interested in buying this product even before it came out but i have to say i am disappointed this product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill i say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run this product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is i am a fan of apple products have owned 4 ipod 2 ibooks an imac and a macmini but after buying this product i have decided to sell it because it does n't do any thing that can do on your own i do n't think that my mind would change if they added a heart monitor because you know that they for that probably into the range i have been running for the past 3 months on a daily basis and have run and half marathons in the past
i never recieved any replacement paln informtion regarding my warenty i had customer service email stating they would send me the paperwork for the plan but never did ii sure hope when i need to use it i will be able to
this product stinks typically the documentation is not written in standard english but in some that no civilized person understands their support material is exhaustive and exhausting and solves no user problem i bought it primarily for book reading and so far have not been able to access a single one the desktop manager '' tells me the synchronization '' went ok but that proves to be false the stories i downloaded are nowhere to be found i look under franklin reader and find nothing i look under mobi reader and find the same i do n't need another calculator or memo book or solitaire game or voice recorder or player or phone book i wanted a portable library for fiction nonfiction whatever and this gadget will not give it to me if you remember the seinfeld episode in which the foreign professor threw the electronic organizer out the window you have an idea of what i feel like doing with this thing i bought it from a clearance company on ebay for 50 bucks so it 's not a huge loss but i did want an ebook reader apparently there are a lot of ebooks online for the taking or buying but i 'll never see them not with the franklin ebookman anyway and i 'm certainly not going in search of another device once burned twice shy
when trying to download information to the ipod i keep getting error messages reading ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the ipod sometimes the software will recognize the ipod and other times it wo n't i have installed and reinstalled the software several times but it does not seem to fix the problem
amazon fail to deliver item within a reasonable time the item fail to arrive and therefore we never received the good
while the price for this hts is very nice the performance is substandard there 's a hissing sound when the unit is off the dvd player has trouble playing dvds i have a large dvd collection most of them do n't play the surround quality is also very poor it 's a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers do n't put out much sound in order to get this serviced i have to send it out for up to 3 months i bought a progressive dvd player put the audio through the phillips hts 3400 and the video to the tv and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better
the sound was great but the dvd would lag every seconds during any and all movies it drove me nuts i had to return it
this philips dvd has all the features i need but its player is really bad audio just pops before moving to a next song it looks like what philips ' people just do in all of their electronics i really do n't want to talk about this any more because william french and isaicu all talke about these problems
it came down to a choice between a 40 sound system with a seperate dvd player or this 200 system the reason i purchased it was because it would save on space well it may save on space but the functionality was reduced to nearly zero the cons popped in and out when playing cd 's also a cracking sound when it actually played the audio especially from the rear speakers when the unit was turned off volume from the rear speakers n't play many dvd 's right it would just stop as if it could n't read it not read 's picture it did this on all dvd 's played every few seconds it was an intermittent length of time between ocurrences it looked as if it would drop a few frames the audio never varied from being spot on but it looked as if the player could n't keep up with the dvd this is what killed it for me this could be because of a defective unit however i will not be risking my money on another philips player the pros audio output that 's about it my expectations were disappointed horribly i will not be buying another philips if i can help it at all instead i bought a sony slimline dvd player 75 with a 40 sound system and it is far superior far and it plays
july 2005 i was looking for a dvd player for my bedroom at costco and could n't resist the 179 price for this brand new philips is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than i played some dvds and cds and after 2 days i decided to return it for 2 reasons 1. it makes a hissing sound when it 's turned off now it would n't bother me too much in a basement althought it would still be anoying but it 's a definite no no in the bedroom 2. rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them if you do n't mind these 2 things then by all means go for it aug 2005 update having nothing better to do i went and purchased another unit from costco to see if indeed i have a bad unit or it 's a issue surprise surprise second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder ! curious enough i 'm a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from it is the transformer more specific two capacitors making this noise that is really poor design low quality components ! ! ! i did not expect this from a brand name like philips this is no different than any no name units out there at half price as a result i am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product this one is definately not worth the money i can not update the stars but this time i would rate it with 0 stars oct 2006 update it stopped reading cds but it reads dvds no problem returned to costco !
i did n't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning the cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned 30 minutes it didn't
when i first started using this i loved it it worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound in fact i bought a second one for my wife then after about two weeks it stopped working it would no longer play in my cassette deck which ejected it as soon as i put it in every time i tried contacting coby 's support on the web but they were unresponsive luckily amazon took it back for a refund note that they no longer sell these directly bet they had too many
this adapter would not work at all in my 1996 ford ranger the vehicle 's cassette player kept ejecting it however it did work in a 's 1993 ford ranger it also would not work in a 1993 monte carlo same problem
the good when i first heard about this board i was incredibly excited i have been playing battlefield 2 for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys so it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game the interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing the first that i have seen but the price for each is kind of high but well worth it the bad the board is constructed well but do n't expect this to replace your home keyboard the windows keyset '' that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any keyboard but it is awkward to type with i might be biased since i have a msoft ergonomic split keyboard typing is difficult at best with the gaming keysets with most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right side they are all vertical not like u j and m keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other the keys feel a little cheap '' when you push them down they do n't bounce back as much the ugly about 2 weeks after i purchases this board and the keyset 9 keys went completely dead i tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of windows xp to no avail i contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that i have a faulty base unit duh ! they are reviewing my warranty '' but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day maybe this post is premature but i do n't think i am getting a new base unit conclusion the expression great idea bad execution '' holds true here my opinion do n't buy this board ideazon has too many issues not enough support staff and a website that does n't do anything but look good
the is great but if you are playing battlefield 2 and then switch to the zboard you are in a fix the controls are totally different and very hard to get use to if you start with it it might be alright but i think the regular keyboard will be just fine
the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine
i bought this dvd player after my sony player died prematurely is it just me or are dvd players supposed to have a longer life this dvd player looks nice and works fine when it is working the player is a bit noisy when reading the discs though but the bottom line is that it just stopped working after only 1 year of use i expected an improvement over my sony player and i am sorely disappointed
good while it lasted pos broke yesterday for no reason wo n't read anything i put in it phillips customer service was no help i have to buy and new dvd player and it wo n't be a phillips
i recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon it is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent however the unit would only work using the s video connector not separate connections the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud
this dvd player does play all types of dvds no matter how you burn it but like other reviews it stopped working after months in my case it was 3 months it just does n't turn on anymore i unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead i do n't watch dvds much so it 's not like i overused it go with another model this one has problems i thought mines would be the exception but i guess not and now i ca n't return it because it 's been over 30 days
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
the panasonic cd player has a good sound quality but does not automatically change from one cd to the next it requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one cd to another this feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five cd's
i purchased this memory card for a camera i was also purchasing it was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page when i received the card first and then the camera i was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit because i had opened the plastic package to the card i was unable to return it in fact when i emailed the company who sent it i never even received a response
grossly and useless sony 's 10 headphones sounded just as good the headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best
i was so excited to get this for my ipod i love listening to my music in my car but was really disappointed when it would n't fit into my 2003 gmc envoy there are two cup holders in the front and granted they are in weird spots but the tunedok would n't fit if i put it in the front cupholder it would interfere with the gear thing and if i put it in the back cupholder i had no where to put my cups plus it interfered with the box
pros perfect sound solved resampling issues cons famous noises makes it useless for gaming especially in which use openal by creative crystallizer is useless this card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20 of high end systems not only nvidia nforce 4 chipset but also with other amd and intel cpu motherboards see google for '' even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a good chance to get it after any memory or hd upgrade or driver configuration change for long time creative denied existence of this problem eventually it was recognized see official cl forums and a new driver since november 2005 ! was promised at the end of may 2006 but beta version published did not solve my problem in the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial hacked '' drivers i suspect that crackling is an architecture design flow which can not be completely solved at software level because pci bus can not provide sufficient memory access for the the fastest sound processor '' simultaneously with high end graphic card hd controller and other devices bottom end i have to stop playing games or go back to low quality integrated sound do not take risk wait for working drivers or buy a working card from different manufacturer with fixed drivers i would give this card 4 or 5 stars update i found that many desktop motherboards mb have really slow south bridge south bridge is connecting pci usb firewire and hd to cpu directly or through north bridge especially mbs with nvidia chipsets and even with some intel mbs new beta driver and mb bios updates solved the problem in many cases but not for my mb asrock nvidia 6100 410 mcp chipset but situation is still marginal and might go unstable again i contact cl customer service they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ati chipsets athlon 64 ati 200 or 3200 have no problems with i decided not to return sb to seller but save it for a new computer with ati based mb i guess that majority of workstation class mbs with upscale south bridge and even nvidia based also should be fine with the trouble is that majority of buyers have generic nvidia based mbs like me so i can give two stars instead of 1 but i can not change the rating and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release if it will work
i thought this would be a great buy but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy screw that
i am the type of person that always buys the extra warranty on whatever i purchase however i started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still had n't received their refund check i was astonished i contacted myself and asked them about this with no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps i was informed that if i did everything by email it would take at least 15 business days that 's three weeks ! to receive my refund check after i sent them the warrantied item if i had them send me a label for the defective item instead of using my own printer it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item in other words it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks ! i cancelled the contract immediately it is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract i would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as grado sennheiser or koss but stay away from these people that 's my feeling and my advice
i paid for it and got an link but have yet to receive the written conformation called the 1800 it 's been a month if it 's this hard to get the plan i wonder how it will be if i need to replace my product
i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc '' errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player does n't work it 's essentially useless this is a complete at any price point
we own the bought at costco it is possible that the newer d '' model has fixed the hissing we hear during mode we have owned it about a year now and i believe it is getting louder when the house is quiet i can hear it in the next room it does n't bother my wife she finds it restful i do n't like it because i do n't think it should be making any sound at all given the choice i would not buy this product again
do n't buy this product there simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase since it was 30 days outside the warrantly apple support told me sorry tough luck '' i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong ! second ipod just died same battery problem this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and of course by the time i got in i was past the 12 month warranty period who keeps track of the purchase date i sure did n't other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year it is a fantastic product i 'm just sorry that it did n't last twice ! cause otherwise i 'd be a fan
never seen a worse less intuitive inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that itunes apples is up to it 's usual standard that 's precisely why i prefer not to mess with it
i can neither rate nor review this item because i just realized i have to have two of them to use it they call it an intercom system but it is really only half a system amazon says there are only two left so if this seems to be what you are looking for better buy both i bought a second one tonight
about three years ago maybe four i bought two lexar cfii cards one never worked the other worked but lost all data i wrote to lexar that i had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she did n't care about losing i still have my card in a ziplock none of the file removal programs will get the images off i 've used all of them had their file removal tech help give up in this day age of just make the item '' i am upset but you take your chances do you want the only picture of your great lost because you used a lexar i would n't i use an actual sandisk card myself if they ever lexar made it right i may have written a better review but they have n't so that tells me that they do n't care how important are your pictures to you frederic
i had the same experience as the reviewer on i tested the ups by shutting off the power at the breaker within a minute the ups software shut down the computer i had set for 4 minutes so obviously the battery was n't going to hold up long only load was computer monitor and router at any rate the shut down was successful but upon about 30 seconds into the reboot the ups beeped and cut power to the outlets which killed the computer and killed the router for a second or so absolutely worthless as the whole reason i wanted the ups was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips i have here
most people buy a ups plug it in and never test it to make sure it works i tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage i set it to shutdown windows after 1 minute only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it after power was cut it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down then i restored power to the ups after about 30 seconds it beeped clicked and temporarily dropped power to the computer while it was rebooting ! so when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted that is unacceptable a ups should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it
i would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime under a load it only lasted 3 minutes while the es 500 lasted almost 12 minutes the es 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime in my opinion this ups is only good for very small loads less than the average computer
i do n't own this specific apc product but i do own other apc products my home was hit by lightning on july 2 2004 during a severe lightning storm both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate power line surge protectors made by apc surge protectors offer the best damaged equipment warranty that apc offers apc refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination the surge protectors are functioning properly i had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs i will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike but the apc warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs i now do not recommend apc equipment since their warranty is worthless
if you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet your unit will not be covered by the aps warranty on this device lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried the cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with aps they denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage even though the modem was n't hurt
designed obsolescence is the word that best discribes delorme no support ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the card worked fine for my son 's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother 's wedding and i lost all the photos from that event i still ca n't believe it happened if you have an ipod or other remember to your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this
this may be a good sd do n't know because the company would not allow shipment to hawaii therefore ordered the viking sd and it has been a very good sd
i am still awaiting resolution of a problem i have with these drives in writing dvds i get verification errors this proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure the drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the ide bus but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire
also import a cd money down the drai
the drive arrived at the end of december was quick to get up and running and worked fine until yesterday then it got the machine equivalent of lockjaw '' and i 've been unable to get the tray to release so it 's a good drive while it operates but i 'll probably make sure i pay for at least a warranty on my next purchase as far as my recommendation goes it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one 's drive fails yesterday i just went to a backup burner and kept working if i had needed to get the job done and i had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy i 'd have been in a seething rage computer hardware is never 100 reliable but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year
i knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true and sure enough they rejected my upcs i kept copies only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say 'whoops a mistake ' i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional
please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date i 've been denied twice the second time they said the u p c number was invalid only it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state all required products were not submitted '' meanwhile i have phoned to lodge a formal complaint the product itself is average i 've used better and worse that said it 's definitely not worth the full asking price
no free lunch you get what you pay for is that the verdict on this product well the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it i need disc binders and the case logic brand while being the original is pricey low cost alternatives are needed but not at the expense of quality and tco total cost of ownership but the flap about poor customer service rebates and poor quality zippers and sleeve binding is enough to give me pause so if someone from xtreme 's management is paying attention it or be content to lose business price is n't everything to everyone in the markt for your
i had all the same rebate issues with this item as others so if you are buying this cd case just because of the rebate please do n't i did finally receive my rebate 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email i just cashed the check and i 'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through ! the product itself seems okay i can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break but i rarely get into my cds so i have n't had that issue yet however i do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around a very dishonest company if you ask me good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate
i also bought this item sent in all of the required documents including original upc rebate denied because upc was not included i emailed them 3 times stating that i did in fact enclose it also quoted the number from the copy of it that i retained to date have heard nothing from them i have now filed a complaint with the texas attorney general and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the ftc ji
i have a collection of over 1500 disks so i have bought many cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that i have purchased i would avoid this brand
i wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different pcs the first a dell precision laptop with 1 gb memory and a 1.8 ghz processor would capture sound just fine but only color haze for video i thought that it was because the has underpowered usb 1.1 ports so i wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop also memory the best that i got was audio with the sound speeded up voices sounded like they were on helium and the same color haze for video apparently it does n't pay to scrimp in this area i will promptly return the product and look for something better from the other reviews it does n't appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent
like so many others in these reviews i should have read them first ! i can categorically say that this is one of the worst products i 've ever bought it does not work tech support is useless and you should not even try to make it work i am a computer expert with a great computer and there is absoutely nothing i can do to make this work do n't buy
i purchased dvd express and it never worked i spent endless time with tech support the old story about it must be your computer '' did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it same problems tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money ads also told me it would not work with ulead 's movie factory 3 some of the software it came bundled with but that was uleads problem i should use cap wiz their program duh ! ! ! guess what it did not work with their program either ulead said they had several complaints with ads 's product their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product ! since ads does n't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade i do n't think they want a product like that either the only reason i gave one star is was packed well ju
i never even traveled with it it just stopped working completely making me lose data never again i 'll buy anything from this company this drive is a piece of rubbish !
when i paid somewhere between 30 a couple of months ago for the optifix pro kit i made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners i 've owned before the package 's description made it seem promising enough and i 've had mostly good experiences with memorex in the past so i just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home after reading the instruction guide carefully before use i 'm positive the product was being used properly but unfortunately the optifix pro just could n't deliver the goods in fact not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs i inserted it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair ! what 's more frustrating two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable i hope fellow cd collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular memorex product
got it at walmart ca n't even remove a scuff i give it -100 good thing i could return it
i bought mine at for 20 followed the instructions with two scratched dvd 's from the library one badly scratched the other still playable and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability it 's going back in the morning this model relies on an aluminum oxide paste superfine liquid sandpaper to sand off the scratches i think i 'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc for cleaning just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol they work just fine
before the repair process there was one bad track on my cd after the repair '' process the entire disk was unplayable took it back for a refund with billions of cds in the world is this the best that the century has to offer
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix camera but the fuji and sandisk product did
i was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to budapest when this card died i was using my new canon rebel xt which had no problems with my 1 gb cards throughout my 17 day trip i lost an entire day of photos i would not recommend this product to anyone
i use a laptop since i am always on the go i noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time i thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop it works and the quailty of the product seems to be great but it really does n't do much if anything at all i think the idea of the cooling pad is great but not effective
you 're money is better spent on another product it 's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made a nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet damn near silent if it is n't damaged i had one fan made a scraping noise the fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop but i 've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in
this product is cheaply made and noisy the usb power cable developed a problem after 30 days do n't get ripped off avoid this unreliable product
i 'm a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuai and have owned several previous models of wacom tablet for the life of me i just could n't get the working on my mac at all the installer crashed kernal panic ! my otherwise rock solid tiger installation downloading the latest driver from wacom 's web site was only marginally useful the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how i adjusted the control panel and even moderately fast motion caused it to submarine '' from one side of the screen to the other wacom 's sparse faq suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away it did n't work and besides i have no plans use the tablet from across the room phone support was no better wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff july off ! too bad it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it looks like my trusty workhorse tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service if this is the level to which wacom 's legendary tech support has fallen
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix camera but the fuji and sandisk product did
i bought this card for my supposedly a supported device but the problems with this card make it nearly useless it comes with a web browser that does n't work even if the browser did work it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version the only downloadable browser that works with the card is eudora which does n't do anything except display text you ca n't even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc are impossible the card is designed to work with netfront and clie mail software that comes with clie devices obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card these programs are not available separately the card would n't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors ' even though my powerbook has no trouble connecting to either no additional configuration required while attempting to connect the card would often stop responding and then lock up the handheld bottom line if you want a pda buy a pda do n't buy this
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix camera but the fuji and sandisk product did
i 've not found anything from memorex that works right try maxell products from amazon you ca n't find better products and the best customer service on the net
i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better the cd 's were not skipping as much but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a cd changer
i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks if you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page i would n't even use this for a notebook
i purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows i could n't wait to get my hands on would n't i it 's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread at first it looked like a really cool product and is if your system is a mac logitech has done a great job of selling the nulooq to windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on there is no tooldial for the windows version a fact that they do n't disclose which is probably the most powerful feature of this product i now feel as though i have wasted my money on what is a useless tool if you have windows and been totally conned by logitech what is even worse is the fact that logitech do n't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for window users so if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you i know where there is one for sale ! ! !
i bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today one big caveat on performance however i am running an older 800 single processor mac which although i use it in a professional graphics capacity every day photoshop is a bit pokey by todays standards after downloading tiger which is required for the tooldail app i got the thing going this is what i found 1 evan after setting all the tooldial prefs to the fastest speed i got slow and jerky navigation the nav ring overshooting the area i wanted to see because of a delayed response also to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press with a firm pressure on the far side of the ring which requires a repositioning of the entire hand poor ergonomiics in my opinion seems like they went for a sexy instead 2 an ipod type dialing motion is fine on an ipod but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in brush size etc and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad 3 the trigger points funtion but require surprisingly heavy pressure to operate at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click this kind of treatment 8 hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week there may be a device out there that will someday revolutionize my workflow '' but this isnt it back it goes
i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2.0 gb compact flash card i like it but the flash card does n't slide in easily sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins to add insult to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk therefore they should work seamlessly together but pathetically they do n't i 'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing for comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly there is no give at all but instead is an effortless process not a quality reader other than that it works as expected surprisingly the reader does n't topple over as easily as i thought it would it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in removing the card is extremely easy that 's a process eject '' the card from the pc 's drive and then remove it data transfer from the card to pc is very quick overall i 'm glad to have it but it 's an annoyance to use it i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader
at least for my sony dvd burner in my powermac completely unrecognized and bloody difficult to get out of the machine without a reboot
some of the worst dvds that i have purchased i would n't waste my money on any more of these pos discs i wish i could return them to amazon but for what i paid it was pretty cheap its not worth the effort
if they were n't free i 'd give them 1 star media code mcc 2 of 10 were coasters at with my dvdrw
they have no label on the top hard tell which side is up these are the worst dvdrs i have ever seen and used the speed is much slower than other brand dvdr such as ridata although they are both 3 of 4 dvdrs got errors during burning but other brand dvdrs are 100 i am going to return these package to amazon
you charge too much for shipping and handling i would have been better off going to a retail store
once you get this remote working which i found challenging and i work with computers all day long you 'll definitely like how it works and it 's better than programming in codes the biggest problem is the charging dock does n't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts which means it 's usually dead when i go to pick it up i 've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which both of my have and they 're not even answering last time i called they said many people were having the same problem and all i had to do was squeeze a piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection that solution has n't worked they 're on to something but i 'd wait for a version where they 've addresed this issue
this was everything i looked for in an player but only for about first 6 months about half a year from getting it the headphone input went making the audio staticy and constantly going mono had to send it in for repairs after another months of light use mostly in the car so it 's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets the problem reoccurred had to send it for repairs again a couple of months later after the 1 year warranty expired i noticed that the battery life started to decrease in a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged i nevertheless continued using the unit being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that i charge it every night so a couple of weeks ago about 15 months after purchase it stopped working completely when turned on it gives hdd error '' message resetting does not work the computer no longer sees '' it when it 's plugged in i emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is 195 needless to say that i wo n't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit i really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to model but i doubt i 'll trust this manufacturer again
i bought my in early october of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems in under a year i have sent it back to them twice and i am about to do so for a third time the problem is with the volume it goes from low to loud randomly the volume problem appears to be a defect with the itself i know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem the difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they ca n't fix it this time i wo n't either i think i 'll be done with this company when you read all the things the can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great player but it rarely works
i 've had this since xmas 05. it gave me trouble initially then the problem went away since july it has n't worked for more than a few hours despite cowon 's several attempts to fix it this is the third or maybe now it 's the time that the sound on my 20 gb iaudio has cut out cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago the screen shows that the song is playing it 's just that no sound comes out besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat this is a quibble however that one can live with given the problems i 'm having with it i considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good
just like others have stated the paint comes off the keys after a few months of use you would think logitech would have made a better product
great looking keyboard unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed that includes cleaning and do n't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it the keyboard self destructs after you have the count them and of screws i called their customer support they were n't like dell nobody is that bad but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50 off their retail price shipping was extra so you save maybe 10 off street prices they are no longer the good company they were in the past they need competition so i 'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement too bad they do n't make those old keyboards anylonger
i purchased my tv in dec 2004. i did not purchase the extended warranty these sets are have all kinds of video problems myself and other lcd owners have called for in home service the service company is qualxserv in home service they want 350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty and can not guarantee a fix take it from me buy some other bran
well i ca n't give an honest review of this product because i have n't yet received it i ordered it on june 15 and it was promised by amazon direct not another seller via amazon between june 21 and june 23. so i 'm sitting here on july 15 with no tv it really is n't amazon 's fault it 's the shipper eagle but whatever i 'm less than satisfied with this transaction i have seen the tv in stores and it looks good though
the lcd is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency you may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the rabbit ears tv antennas even then if you are in an are with good fm radio coverage it 's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work mostly you ca n't use this with a cover on and you 'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long the modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution
i was using the tape player for my ipod but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck i was forced to go to the fm transmitter i had expected it to be as clear as my radio afterall it feeds off radio frequency i was very very disappointed it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter static can increase or decrease i know it was n't because i had weak radio frequency the other stations were perfectly clear so i blame the transmitter i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it i 'm glad target took it back
i purchased 1 of the old model when i bought my ipod as hard as i tried i was unable to switch stations on it okay '' i thought i must have got the one bad one '' so i called griffin and they were not much help they said that the radio stations '' may have been bad and said i would need to down load new software well no luck it still did n't work and the one station i could get sounded like horrible when it worked at all so then i saw the new version out on the market so i figured i 'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use i bought 2 of them 1 for me and 1 for my wife neither one sounds any good i can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but i ca n't hear my ipod from 4 feet away both of them sound exactly the same they constantly sound fuzzy like they are just not tuned in right '' if you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the itrip then the sound distorts before the station fuzz '' goes away only a fool walks on thin ice twice and i 've done it 3 times now never again ! do n't follow in my footsteps ! please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage
i have had this system for 9 monthis now and i am sure this is the worst piece of av equipment i have ever owned sony is usually known for quality products but it this case i am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market the worst part is that i have had numerous problems with it occasionaly it fails to recognize inserted after you turn it off and back on on other occasions it completely locks up the first time it happened i had to call sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it now after about 9 months of use it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message protect unplug '' the only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes there is nothing wrong with my electric wiring i have checked and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge conditioner i am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it at this point it 's just not worth it because of all the other things i despise about this system first off cds and dvds take forever to load to insert a disk one has to press an eject '' button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk if you missed your chance tough luck start all over second it is a royal pain to use any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be on screen menus a standard on most systems now do not exist and the manual is a joke third the fm radio is awful i went out and spent money on an expensive fm antenna still my cheap clock radio gets better reception fourth there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review finally i do n't share people 's opinion that the sound is all that great it 's average it is way too heavy on bass the wireless feature is nice i admit and that was the reason i bought it but i would not buy it again or probably another piece of sony equipment in a million years now i could live with wires running around my room or even just a system rather than deal with this piece of junk shame on sony for slapping their name on this lemon
i ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here big mistake upon setting everything up it all worked great for about two hours then the dreaded '' screen came up now it wo n't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode and no it 's not a short in the wires or overheating it protects even when stone cold and with no speakers plugged in i called sony and they say it is a short in the box so now my two options are to unhook everything repack exactly the way it came to me and reship back to the online store i bought it from with enormous hastle and expense or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center which happens to be across town and only open so much for being convenient this thing is brand new and already needs repairs ! ! on top of that even out of the box none of the video inputs worked audio was fine but video was dead as a doornail right from the start and even on top of the fact that this machine came broken it sucks even when it works right ! the dvds take forever to load and it comes with hdmi out but no hdmi in ! so if you 're an hdmi user i hope you have multiple hdmi inputs on your television one for your cable box one for this crappy system this is a piece of junk for the love of god do n't waste your money
i 've owned mine for 2 months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it has n't work since day one some dream system the 'authorized ' repair center is a total joke as well after being at the repair center for 6 weeks i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that i need to send it back to sony in texas i get to pay for the boxes packaging material and the shipping yeah ! ! ! ! and i have n't even watched a movie ye
the sd slot stopped working last night very frustrating the compact flash card slot still works though i noticed a reviewer mentioned that it did n't work with their sd card it did work with my transcend sd card
tried to use fujifilm xd cards type m does n't recognize them still trying to resolve situation with lexar they say that despite package claim of xd compatibility another reader model is needed
buyer beware this reader does not work with large sd cards i could not get it to work with a new 4 gb sd card my 1 gb cards work fine but anything over that will probably not work i confirmed with with lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet
the sound on this system is really fantastic for the price but i 've had the same experience as the other reviewer the dvd skips constantly and phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50 credit but phillips insists that i send at my own expense the machine to them and then wait weeks to have a 'possibly ' refurbished unit i 'm quite disappointed with phillips and its lack of customer service
this system is quite sleek easy to fit in a cluttered living room assembly takes about two minutes the instructions are very clear the sound is amazing especially when you put on your favorite loud film why then do i give it one star it skips like nobody 's business at first my wife and i thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched but then we put in new disks no difference when exactly does it skip impossible to tell sometimes a little sometimes every frame ! sometimes it 'll tell us that disks are bad then the next time we put them in they magically work until they skip so i called philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping but they could not guarantee that they would fix it and it would take up to a month before they 'd ship it back save your money ! buy from someone else
why would you want this item amazon is charging 50 more on this item than the generation shuffle ! and according to what i have read this shuffle is n't very derable it does n't even last a year ! i do n't know about you but i 'll get a generation shuffle
one day it just stopped working i got the dreaded orange and green flashing lights of death '' the contents of the file space were and i ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that apple likes to keep
thank goodness for apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year warrenty and then die i would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed 100 dollar ipods
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
the extendable arm breaks very easily i had two of them and they both broke within the first month the company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement very poor product do not buy
recieved as a present from my wife poor girl got sold on this thing at circuit city anyway it was alright pretty average transmitter the thing broke immediately after it 's 3 month warranty expired i contacted dlo 's customer service and they were rude as heck i understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all would n't even offer to fix it if i covered the costs so basically i have a useless piece of plastic and electronics i bought a monster icarplay and have loved it it 's put together much better better sound no annoying little issues and a more reputable company do n't spend your hard earned money on dlo get something that will last
first off the ipod jiggles no matter what you do secondly it does n't stay straight on the power plug it constantly tilts the whole thing not worth 10
application is dual input from cable tv input and analog pc input used as side monitor on a triple screen home computer workstation 1 audio output stops intermittently a few times a week requiring power to regain audio 2 there appears to be no way to disable unused source modes to switch from computer input to tv input requires one push of the source button but then to return to computer input requires 4 button pushes as the tv cycles thru av component modes and finally back to pc mode a weak design the unit should recognize which input is enabled it is not possible to hook up all 5 modes this is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a monitor picture quality is acceptable for the application which is primarily watching news channels while working at pc or displaying dual pc applications
while i am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me i am a little disappointed i 've had this thing for a couple years now about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound so i went back and replaced it they did n't even ask what the problem was they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements then over the past few months the dvd player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever i use it i have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it and now the player has stopped working completely i have a dvd in there that i ca n't get out which for the record is part of a sopranos season they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace bose failed me once shame on them they failed me twice shame on me i 'm gon na go with something else
seller 's for an honest review go to the correct page for the bose 321 graphite accoustimass module and two satellite speakers that will have the correct retail rate and draw the true this price of 700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here i hope this helped you in your endeavors and i look forward to competing with you in the future ! buyer 's buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or mistakes '' on the sellers ' part in contractual agreements to amazon customer service because if this ad by that is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system 2 satellite and 1 lrg acoustimass you are in for a steal ! literally so get a goin ! lol disclaimer this review is an posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description which is it 2 speakers or 3 in this advertisement for above mentioned product why is n't bose listed as a seller ! doh no slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true
i do n't dispute that bose is a leader in speaker technology but there is a reason this item is discontinued it locks up when playing certain dvds sometimes after selecting play movie '' it wo n't get past the menu you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen other dvds will play fine but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the dvd the next time you turn it on it will say bad disc '' and locks up you ca n't play you ca n't eject nothing you have to unplug it and essentially reboot the system maybe i got the lemon i do n't know but it 's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name bose this system is definitely an exception to that rule
i bought this 18 months ago and while i had some problems with the set up i got help from the store where i bought it it has really nice sound but it has a serious problem not once but twice when my children inserted dvds in the player they would not eject ! since no one could service it locally i went to 3 places and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they could n't since they would have had to open it up i had to send it to bose that cost a lot plus bose charges a minimum of about 240 i forget the exact amount to even look at it now the exact same thing has happened this is the second episode ! they say you can repair this easily but i went through the recommended procedures with a bose technician over the phone and it did n't work there 's no way i 'm sending this machine back to them i 'm getting something else ! any recommendations finally lest you think the kids are somehow to blame let me note that they work daily with other dvds cd players and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them i normally do n't like having to pay extra for a warranty but if you insist on getting this product i 'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty
after only 3 months the sandisk cruzer micro died data was lost could not be read both my desktop and laptop computer wanted to reformat the cruzer but when i tried to format it could not flash drive is totally useless i replaced it with a kingston data traveller and i hope it lasts longer
the 2.0 gb sandisk cruzer micro flash drive looked like a good deal when i saw it on display at office depot it was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files was rated for usb 2.0 and was reasonably priced my first choice would have been an larger version of the 1.0 gb iomega i use at work but alas such was n't available unfortunately i waited too long to put the sandisk through its paces or i would have tried to get a refund as many others have remarked it is horribly slow while backing up my roughly files i found that it was taking about a second per file longer for the big ones this translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation bulk deletes take just as long to carry out using my beyond compare file synchronization software to the sandisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast until for no obvious reason it hung on one particular word document this evening i could n't even get my windows xp machine to shut down without yanking the sandisk from its slot the usual safely remove hardware '' operation would n't work after three attempts to read the same file and three reboots i tried to delete it from windows explorer and this operation hung too finally i was able to do the deletion from the dos prompt just like 1985 ! i then recopied the file and now beyond compare can finish its work without a hitch but can i trust the sandisk to deliver up my precious files when i really need them i dunno so it 's back to the drawing board maybe by now iomega has come out with that 2.0 gb model as for the sandisk i 'm reminded of that painful adage you get what you pay for ugh
bought this about two months ago never liked it for two reasons rubber cap is so easy to lose guess that 's why it comes with spares though slow ! this is what was most uncomfortable with the drive yeah it 's slow only with groups of small files like everyone else said still it 's annoying to have to zip a bunch of small files everytime before you copy them over to the drive then unzip when you want to them not practical and now well it just stopped working last week i mean completely for no reason just great like one day before i was going to sell it to someone else stay away from this one
i bought this flash drive like a month ago and it stopped working just like that ! one day i plugged it in a portatil hp pc and windows explorer didn t respond it s a xp i unplugged it and tried again with the same result the same with the regular pc s where i usually use this flash drive bottom line money wasted being a regular costumer of sandisk i must say im very dissapointed the must frustating thing is that i wont get a refund because the 30 days expired besides it comes with a cheap cover instead of the regular one the 512 micro flash drive so try some other product
do not buy this product it is incredibly slow by far the slowest usb drive out of the dozen or so that i 've used it handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files i attempted to copy 1500 files 800 directories to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy ! that 's roughly deleting the files was painful as well taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything for kicks i popped in an old 128 mb kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds bottom line is do n't be fooled by the drive 's small physical size large capacity and price point it simply does n't perform
the clock itself works well it did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect we set a backup alarm the first night the idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea but why would scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio does n't make sense to me granted i live in a rural area but i am able to receive both am and fm stations from as far away as fresno some 50 miles away on other radios in the house including a small portable one and we do have a local fm station the tuner is so sensitive that i had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station i am unable to receive one am station and i eventually very gingerly dialed in two fairly clear fm stations one from fresno one local but neither stay tuned in morning when the alarm goes off nothing but static a strange thing though once while trying to locate a station i received a fairly clear one from salt lake city ! i plan to return the product
i used to have this same unit under the brand name emerson research '' it 's a pretty good unit but it 's a very old model for the price you can get a much more modern one from emerson research at a local store
i too bought these after not finding spindles of the verbatim dl a few work but only a very few i have an nec recorder which works completely reliably on most media but not these the machine is a dual xeon with of ram so this is not a resource issue sigh
these disks would not work with my sony brand dvd writer i have tried several other brands and so far everything works but memorex
backed up some movies and not even 1 played well they either skipped or did n't play at all i backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files wo n't even open says damaged or corrupted files absolute junk ! i will stick with verbatim from now on
to back up my personal dvd collection i burned 200 discs 100 on these memorex 's 100 on philips 's every memorex had flaws during playback every philips was flawless i 've been buying memorex for years but i 'll never buy memorex again
really liked it would have rated it but last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turn on anymore only the clock works just one month out of warranty from other reviews this seems to be a common problem
i liked this machine while it worked but i started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago i got busy and suddenly the warranty was up and then the other day it just would n't turn on at all i had it for 15 months
i purchased this unit about 18 months ago after the warranty ran out the unit first quit working with media then there is an issue with finalizing the dvd which makes the dvd unusable unfortunately this is after you record your show then all is lost it started making squawking noises like something is very wrong it never remembered the language or channels panasonic never did anything about this after reading others with these same issues i would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer
here is the original review of this machine i wrote on june 17 2006 we bought this machine just over a year ago a year and two weeks to be specific we had another very similar panasonic dvd recorder in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch on both for a long time the recorder worked fine recently though it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks ejecting them and even playing them at first we thought this might be because we 'd recorded over the so many times but today we tested one of them in the other machine which has never made any similar noises and the had no problems with it needless to say we 're not happy that the seems to be dying especially since the warranty just ended if you buy or own this machine follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you 're within the warranty period because the noises and problems just get worse panasonic is usually a reliable brand one we 've used for many years but this machine seems to be a lemon we 're actually going to write to panasonic about it i 'll try to post again with the results here is my update which i wrote november 3 this is a review to the one above which i wrote on june 17. i wrote to panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended they sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair including labor of the machine at one of three places they listed the places were all within a drive of my home after doing some research i chose one and brought in the machine they fixed it by replacing the entire internal mechanism '' i do n't know what that means we got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of july it 's now the beginning of november the fixed machine worked fine for a while but in the past few weeks we 've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before i 'm going to try writing to panasonic again and asking for a refund because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it it 's still working but i know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it wo n't avoid this machine again the previous panasonic model we bought has n't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great we 're still big panasonic fans but this particular model is a lemon
i would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months there is a reason the warranty is only 90 days the performance sound quality steadily declines over time the ihome worked great when it was new but it wo n't play songs from the ipod anymore and the radio is a static box
so when i first got the ihome for christmas i loved it well i loved it in spite of the glaring bright light that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep however after awhile the ihome will not register my ipods existence at all today i was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again i would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts this device has become nothing more than a nuisance that wo n't even pick up radio stations so the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled useless
i bought the ihome so that i could choose which songs to wake up to off of my ipod and it worked well when it actually worked after being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off i tossed the item it was n't worth all of the problems to keep at all if i could n't even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning other people have mentioned the too bright display and the gradual volume increase '' which i eventually got used to but i could see how they would be incredibly annoying
we have had ours for almost a year it still works great but there is one big problem the display is a bright light great for visibility of the clock when you need it but unfortunately even when it 's on the lowest setting it lights up our whole room ! my husband sleeps through it fine but i need a dark room to fall asleep and i always have to throw a sweater or towel over it we finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio
i got this for christmas last year i hardly use the thing and when i have i have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it i can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static apparently a short of some sort i was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and read all of the reviews i am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop save your money and buy something else take your time and read through the cotton candy '' reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of and you will see one consistent pattern the connection to the ipod is very poor the alarm does n't function and they feel it is overpriced
i got this player from for about 72 after tax i like the long battery live i did n't have to change the battery after 3 or 4 days of usage the only bug i hate is when i transfer audio tracks from my pc to the player it changed some title and artist 's name for few tracks each transfer is on few different tracks since you ca n't make any changes when the sound tracks is on the player nor can you set a playlist '' on the player so when i transfer an audio book to the player it is not playing in the order of the chapters for the book because of this bug i have to double check the title name every time after a transfer and write down the tracks that the name has been changed and later on manually play the tracks in the order of the eaudio book i assume people use this player for individual soundtrack does n't care about this but for me and people who use it for playing eaudio book will hate this player
my dell laptop running windows xp did n't recognize the device when i plugged it into either usb port i contacted targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that i should try it on another pc if it does n't work on this laptop i have no use for it there is no cd rom for support drivers and targus support stated that i should n't need any drivers went to microsoft website for compatibility and the device was n't listed i should have researched this before the purchase i would not recommend anyone purchasing it
i bought this for my computer and it is useless the unit does not have enough power to provide back up power to my machine be very careful when purchasing these i would first recommend contacting the manufacturer to see what they would recommend apc has offered to give me a discount on a new one if i use this as a trade in but it would cost me a fortune to ship it tiger direct will according to the website only guarantee items against defect therefore i 'm left with an expensive doorstop do n't make the same mistake research before you buy ! my 19 '' monitor and pentium 4 are too much for the
i mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would protect my computer from being killed but instead this thing has killed my computer for the second time in 4 days emitting an ca n't turn the feature off shriek alarm how do smart talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an that ca n't be defeated silenced in addition to doing far far more damage than it can ever prevent ask yourself do you want this shriek alarm going off in your house at i bought one apc product and so far they 're 100 defective and 100 deliterious to the use of my computer it 's a matter of time before it 's deliterious to my sleep
the hook up and downloading the software was very simple there was a error problem with the drivers my computer is fairly new with windows xp i called there support and was told to try it on another computer i install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened i sent it back to amazon and credit my account and bought an other brand amazon is so great about handling returns
i was very excited about this unit when i ordered it but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate vbr encoding and the divx recording feature did n't actually work most of the time a blank screen or a green screen was the result unfortunately given these problems i returned the unit i think i 'm going to look at an older ads unit without the vbr feature to ensure quality and then do any divx transfers by software it seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image too bad this one really had a lot of potential
they would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken
the majority of my cases were damaged in shipping i immediately threw away about eight but as i tried to use the rest i gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well maybe i 'm alone given the other high ratings but these seem more fragile than other slim cases i 've used in the past i 'd give them because they 're cheap if they did n't have to be shipped
this thing is a joke it does n't play loud enough except for low volume listening there is no handle to make moving it easy cheap flimsy construction and a door that you know is going to break soon no battery for the memory i would rather pay more and get something better i am going to return it
i bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my player to it the first unit i received would not turn on at all i contacted philips ' tech support and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense fortunately amazon has a very nice return policy and i sent it back to them instead amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit the replacement stereo arrived in short order and i was immediately disappointed in the sound quality which did n't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that i was replacing after listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a sony bookshelf stereo that i own here are my thoughts 1. the fm reception is not as good as the both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length the philips stereo however would hiss and crackle as i moved around the room my body interfered with the reception this did not happen with the sony stereo 2. the sound quality is not as good as the playing the same song on the two stereos i found that the philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the the sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality also there seemed to be significant distortion in the on the philips stereo making s '' sounds sound more like h '' sounds i also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input 3. the ergonomics of the philips stereo are not so good for one thing the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped if that happens the cd can get wedged in the cd tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove the electronically actuated cd door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the the volume goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening this means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels which is rather limiting finally the stereo is a bit bigger than i was expecting though i could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it i am in the process of returning this stereo and i will try to find a sony system instead unfortunately amazon no longer sells the which i bought just about a year ago i do n't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos the only difference between the sony i bought last year and one i bought in 1989 is the ability to play cds
i 've had the for roughly 14 months the was used for watching movies about once every 2 weeks and big sports event etc the unit worked up to about 1200 hrs then the lamp blew i was hoping to get to at least 1500 hrs before the lamp went out good picture quality for the price 799 but short lamp life get extended warranty check other units first
rated as 3000 hour bulb life when purchased today they claim 4000 hours bulb lasted only 900 hours service at unfocused '' does not care about creating a satisfied customer base would not replace bulb even on a prorated basis
good product forget about service i infocus about my faulty projector january 2005 it is now january 2006 and i still do not have my projector that 's right it 's been one year since my projector stopped working i have given up on it being repaired it was under warranty and am now struggling to get it back so that i can repair it out of my own pocket check this company 's record at the better business bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints
sure these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but i give their functionality an as soon as i opened one of these cases to put a cd in it the case broke it happened to 3 cases out of the 12 i have used already i was n't using excessive force in fact most people call me gentle buy at your own risk and handle with care !
i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers i 've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast i 'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa 's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa 's lasted only a week be warned that these are n't quite the bargain they may initially seem
i 've owned various viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance until i purchased this 2 gb compactflash card it 's possible that this card works well in other uses but i found its performance unacceptable as storage for raw images shot with my canon digital rebel slr anywhere from to of the images were corrupted particularly bad in continuous shooting mode contrast with my lexar media 512 mb and 1 gb cards which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions and without as much of a lag time as the viking card often left waiting seconds after shooting as few as 3 continuous images while the card to recovers ''
read the plan carefully not everything is covered under this plan they will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they do n't have to pay too many exclusions for an everything is covered policy '' do n't waste your mone
i have been charged however i did not get a copy of the policy to date
i returned this contract and asked for a refund but new ignored my first two emails then i called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account i then contacted amazon and they resolved the matter in one day i read reviews for new and most people that actually had to deal with new were not happy the 77 positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product
mouse does not glide smoothly on some surfaces due to the large depression on the bottom of the mouse designed to hold would not glide smooth on rubber mousepad or plastic nor my corrian counter top the idea is good however because when you insert the antenna the mouse turns off this being said it may deserve 5 stars if the correct surface is used
i bought this item like 2 months ago and now it 's broken i 'm sooo frustrated i 'd not recommend buying this item
my roommate 's mouse broke she had the older l shaped receiver and i thought it was because she 's bad with technology but i 'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment and even mine broke a few months later i had a straight receiver it just gave up on me not a battery issue more like a connection issue now i read all these reviews about it breaking on people well i 'll write back when my other roommate 's break and when my cousin 's break do n't get me wrong but it was great while it lasted less than half a year gon na go back to my logitech that never broke on me
this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help it is very tempremental and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement so a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so
i have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken the l '' shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem i will call it a receiver it you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break over time the receiver does n't receive i would not recommend this product it 's better to have a straight receiver
beware of this product it always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer i have another usb 1.0 card reader that works perfectly i upgrade to get the speed boost with usb 2.0 but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy
the chare for shipping and handling of this small item was ridiculous ! i would have been better off buying at a retail store
i bought this memory card for my canon sd 200 after using it for approximately 3 months with no problems whatsoever i took a video and the card just flat out broke first the screen said image not available '' and then memory card error '' i tried everything to fix it but nothing worked i lost all the pictured i had stored on it and found it was cheaper and easier to just buy a new memory card instead of paying to get it fixed now i have a panosonic one and i 'm really happy with it my advice splurge on the more expensive card from a reliable brand and it 'll be worth it
when i purchased these batteries i was very pleased but that wore off after a couple of months i do n't use my camera all that often but when i do i expect ther batteries to have some charge i recharge them per instructions and they do not hold a charge any know monster makes good products but i am a little disappointed in this one
you can get a 4 pack of emerging power 2100 mah batteries for 9.95 on this very site i did they work great why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries ridiculous
it made little notable difference or improvement i would not recommend this product for small scratches and it only makes minor improvements to anything more serious
i just ran my first and last cd through the scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when i started did n't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own it really is worse than when i started
i foolishly placed my irreplaceable 200 dvd in this machine as instructed the result was a disaster ! the machine added visible scratches and made playback worse not better suggestion if you have valuable cds or dvds send them to a professional repair service that uses professional equipment do n't mess around with cheap junk
i will make this review very simple no matter what features you find attractive about this remote its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable unless you have large hands you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it in terms of features the remote has only the simplest of learning '' features if you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it does n't have a code for good luck
this remote is so hard to use and setup the xpress functions do n't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers get something else
i have used this mouse for 3 months with my laptop and general use are fine for short periods of time 1 hour however i am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem intermittently after the mouse will go into a move to the left '' mode and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen sometimes it will move to the this is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable i will often at least 10 times in a 30 minute period have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing frustrating if you are trying to click through a menu for instance another example is if you working on any or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time mouse will move when it feels like it it was ok for a while but now it is annoying going to buy a replacement if i have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life it gets no more than 2 stars it could be just this one particular mouse but then that points to lack of qa at the manufacturer end again 2 stars
i purchased this for my laptop it worked great at first there were blue and red lights that would brighten up when it was awake not anymore the blue light completely stopped working it used to be plug and play not anymore basically it is useless it just does n't work it was used probably 30 times at the most complete junk i like the smallness and shape of it though time to try a different brand
do n't purchase this if you 're expecting to get a 1500 mah battery they sent a 1300 mah digicom battery instead
with a full charge it does not last more than could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera canon the original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge initially i thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all i 'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too
i read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport and low ambient sound headpohones without breaking the bank i 'm on a plane frequently i wanted something that i would n't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels i found that the uneven cord lengths are very especially if you like to use only one plug like maybe at your desk at work the weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite even when sitting still so then i thought these will be great workout headphones wo n't be upset if i break or lose them however the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand the effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience even when you are sitting stationary at your desk it is similar to wearing a stethescope which defeats the point of wearing headphones which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise i do not recommend these headphones because of this stethescope i could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses they are after all designed to wear behind the head i 'm on the hunt for better quality headphones
as most anyone will tell you these speakers do have excellent sound and if you 're just going to set them up on your desktop then i 'd give them 5 stars however the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you ca n't them logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no universal speaker mounts '' will work with them if you want to see how they mount go to logitech 's website go to product support and enter wall mounting some might argue that they 're computer speakers not home entertainment center speakers but for 300 i expect a little bit better design
i had so many bad burns with my first spindle that i had to ask for an exchange the new spindle had at least 5 bad burns too also the edge of the disc was n't rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside never again will i buy memorex discs dvd cd or otherwise
one out of every 4 discs would fail on me when i 'd burn to this media at slowing down the burn to did n't help either ! i own a sony with the latest firmware memorex is n't on their compatibility list lesson learned check the compatibility list before buying
use maxell or fuji disks they work flawlessly
i 've had several upss now for a while belkin ups quit after about 3 years of work i understand that this may be long enough but i have several from apc and they are still working one ups i think now has been in service 7 or 8 years
buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the tv you will be left on your own to sort it out amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email run around ! ! bare that in mind before making any large purchase may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back
unit apparently does not work with older magnavox vhs wasted my money
i was trying to duplicate tapes and the ads tech video express is not a viable solution it drops frames and there are nothing that can be done to improve its recording the installation is buggy i ended up buying a sony and am extremely happy with it
i purchased gigbit 3824 extermely bad on gigabit many errors with applications exchange server remote desktop loop in network ultimately replaced it with linksys much excellent performance i am happy no
here 's a quick comparison for my wireless mouse duracell 1 month memorex 2 days do i have to say anything else
the first cd in this pack was damaged even before writing well i was able to write the second one without issues hope the rest of them would be fine too
i 've got a dvdrw burner revision in my fast mac running os x tiger and burning with toast titanium 7. although my burner is nominally it only burns at about in my setup probably due to the slow ata 33 bus it 's on i 've used a number of different brands of and disks both and and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2 so few in fact that i often do n't bother verifying video dvd 's anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs i always verify data dvd 's since errors in those are not ignorable but with memorex i 've gotten about 20 failures including a couple of aborted burns ! in one case the disc had a blank band between two burned ones ! the memorex discs i 'm referring to have manufacturer id cmc mag '' according to these are sold under at least 7 different brand names the reviews there are rather mixed which is not imho good enough ! i have not btw have had any problems with the memorex discs i 've tried but i stopped using them because one of my players wo n't recognize the format
i have used three other brands of and none of them have been problematic with my new tivo dvd burner this is the first brand that just has n't worked these discs were a waste of time shopping for they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns and they were a waste of money i am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the amazon marketplace since it would n't be fair to other buyers for your information i have had no problem with sony fuji and verbatim
it gave me format errors out of the i returned it to tiger direct for an exchange and got a refund instead not to happy about paying all the shipping costs for nothing
i did the research on this product and it was one of the best i do n't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included one if not the only reason i had purchased it i and received no reply if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way
you will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the panasonics that cost about the same this is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there 1 the speakers are lightweight and shoddily built they sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about they are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets in them these are 3 way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be 2 way ! 2 the sound input consists of a headphone type jack in front not even standard phono inputs at the back 3 its advertised as 320 watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck what good is a high power amp with crappy speakers and in case you know some audio 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts log relationship for some reason this is not even half as loud as my 100 w receiver ! 4 no user adjustable equalizer only presets possible 5 can not connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping '' type of connections 6 the receiver sucks even my sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver i concur with the other reviewer death to sony ! shame on them for taking consumers for a ride this company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it competively '' with the others meaning fat profit margins
i thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old which was a bit big for my new smaller room but i was the minisystem is truely mini '' and inferior in quality to the older which was around 280 and was well worth it this system does not deliver the 320 watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room moreover it lacks an auxilary and game sync so you ca n't hook up your tv ipod or xbox to
this model was intended as a replacement for my and yet quite functional panasonic stereo this is the kind of thing that happens when you browse amazon while drunk late at night unfortunately with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality the sony is in all respects inferior ergonomics appearance and above all fm reception which is laughably poor do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver hiss abounds several local stations i heard previously are now unreachable and to top it off sony has stuck with their habit of using proprietary connectors so when i went to plug in an antenna to get better reception i found a weird little plug that i had n't noticed when i put the damned thing together grrr so now i 'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new panasonic with the proceeds death to sony
i 'm so dissappointed in caselogic for discontinuing the hard cases they were great a hard cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center somebody could have sat on it and it would 've been
first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones always pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel ! ! ! ! !
hardware awesome software a flop since you have to use their software the package is destroyed i will give you the final nail on the coffin for me i tried to put podcasts on the device using the latest sonicstage 4. no chance it wants to be able to find each artist '' in the sony library this was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library i had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend no chance now shame as the hardware was
i bought this thinking failures due to normal wear and tear '' which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page would include accidental damage such as dropping however the pdf indicates that 3 damage from accident abuse misuse introduction of foreign objects into the product '' is not covered this is just an extended manufacturer 's warranty a call to customer service confirms this damage due to accidents are not covered save your money
i have a pny disk shortly after the purchase i started getting memory card error '' it lasted intermittently for another month then died this is a sure sign of poor quality control i bought pny because it was slightly cheaper than the other disks i suggest investing your money elsewhere it is worth the extra to save your precious information
i just recieved my brandnew sd memory card from newegg a few hours ago it came in factory packaging and i know is brand new immidiatly upon putting it in my card reader it said card read error '' i have put it in serveral other computers and cameras in an attempt to format it this card is shot and i just got it this is not the first pny 256 to do this to me i gave one away previously in frustrastion thinking it was my computer it was not i tried to call there tech support but at first it gave me only the option of where to buy their products when i called again it was closed and offered no info on sd memory i went online and looked for support for sd but would n't you know they do n't have any faqs on it i tried to write them an email on it but there mail server crashed and my 10 minutes of typing to there tech support was in vein i have read that many others have recieved cards that did n't work when they got them or failed after 1 or 2 erase cycles in short do n't by pny spend the extra money and get something that will work if it does n't work i do n't think tech support will help you if you want to roll the dice and take a chance and something that probably wont work than pny is for you if you do n't believe me call their tech support 18002344597 you try to ask them about there fine sd memory go to their website to see what they have to say about there fine products spend the 5 minutes to look into it before buying it on impuls
i purchased this game pad due to good reviews found it online for 15 with free shipping so had to try myself its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand the programming software is alright as well not as nice as the nostromo software for example but what i didnt like about it was much more relavant firstly there is a toggle lock shift button this button is easy to press by accident and since it is not a momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian interupting game play also buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb and quite far from normal thumb use i had a hard time using those buttons quickly also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10. and finally for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back and ill soon go with the logitech
the fm tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations the radio part hence was worthless the speakers are sub standard no depth without the remote little can be done all in all it is not worth trying my cheap 20 year old sony boombox is of much higher quality
very dissapointed with this boombox the fm tuner has too much interference the fm is fine if you listen to a strong station but if you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for fm only am the am has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it for example i live in atlanta ga so the strongest am signal is 750 wsb so if i try to tune into 780 wbbm at night i get 750 bleeding through i have had other panasonic boomboxes that have this trouble with am so if you listen to the radio like i do please check it out see what i mean i hope panasonic will correct this on future model
while the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice feels grippy but not sticky if you know what i mean some of the features are just wrong for instance the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off also for whatever reason the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out the armband is satisfactory at best it 's just a standard no frills velcro armband
i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you ca n't save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go will go on hold and next time you wan na play it just push it back hopefully if you did it right you 'll have the game right back in the place you left it saved me 50 it can do the same thing for yo
your rebate submission has been received unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons request postmarked after close of program deadline required postmark before actual postmark there was absolutely no submission deadline given except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase all were followed to the t '' i submitted the rebate immediately after i received the merchandise from amazon give me a break i 'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10 ' pole if it was not so piddling an amount this would be worth reporting to fcc but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops probably for nothing more heartache just forego rebates send viking back to the boat and purchase another brand
not a bad little unit wish it remembered where you were on the cd when you turn it off like other units i 'm used to especially since it does n't really shut off '' but goes into '' mode not as much power as i thought it would have for 30 watts would be nice if the aux jack was on the front not the back speaker 2 output would be nice simple little unit works fine so
he did n't send me the product that he was selling the keypad is not usb and also it was n't new and also it was n't targus i want my money back or the real product that i payed for
great disappointment plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications i own excel word freehand among others and displayed typed numbers when it did with extra spaces and squared characters should specify in the product description that is not mac compatible i 'm not aware if pc users faced this problem as well
i purchased two ten packs of lenmar batteries of the twenty batteries only 4 would take a charge i used 3 different chargers an energizer lacrosse and a the lacrosse is a charger with diagnostics can display voltage levels individually for each battery it can also 'repair ' batteries maximum capacities etc so can the none could charge the 16 faulty batteries i sent both 10 packs back
i was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack they are rated at 2000 mah but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames my 2 year old panasonic 1600 mah in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots i tried these batteries in my player and even there it wo n't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback it is not that the battery does not hold any charge that it has but it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices it seems to be all right for use in a flashlight a set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight a bit dimly for hours yeah i tested it for the test i had charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration it is not a charger issue i plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but one last tip nowadays the best nimh batteries are made by sanyo it is better to pay 2 4 times for them than for a lenmar trust me
i owned four different sets of nimh aas this was the latest purchase and the first one to stop working i do have decent chargers and never dropped them or anything it actually ruined my day twice very disappointed
this is my second disappointment with linksys products i have purchased this ap to use in ap client mode connected to my netgear wireless router the product comes with no user manual or technical specifications sheet after spending some time trying to set up connection i have found user manual on linksys web site and discovered that ap client as well as ap repeater modes are supported only with another linksys access point it 's not compatible with other vendor 's products when i tried to use it in access point mode the signal was times weaker then my old netgear 's i am getting very good to excellent signal quality from netgear mbps and good to very good 11 to 24 mbps from
we bought this ap to use with wpa enterprise using a radius server and basically it dose n't work at first we could n't get it to communicate with our radius server at all we resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked then authentication worked but we could n't get an address via dhcp we could n't resolve this so we assigned a static address but could n't pass any traffic over the link unfortunately we found the linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless there only suggestion was to try different firmware once we had done this they could n't help any more so basically they might say it works but it does n't tried a different manufacturers ap worked straight away
this thing is junk ! ! ! do n't waste your money i am a computer professional and i had it working for about 5 minutes then after powering it down and back up it never did work again ! if you buy one go through the setup and if it does n't work immediately send it right back to amazon ! do n't waste your precious time trying to get a 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time finally amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged however you should pay more attention to the bad reviews than the good ones if the product is in fact good it wo n't have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional however look up all the bad reviews for this product they should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product
this product is not for the heavy handed after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs ' on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types
the reader did n't read my minisd i have another reader that does so i dumped the mobilemate and took the lost
this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix camera but the fuji and sandisk product did
this gps comes with us map on the sd card and canada map on the included cd but never the twain shall meet by car i 'm a few hours from canada and several days from the eastern us but i ca n't swap out the faraway eastern us part of the map on the tomtom go 300 for a nearby canadian map it 's either all canada or all contiguous us this is a major functional flaw if you live near the border or live further away and like to take trips oh and if you do decide to swap out the us map be sure to save it on your computer first tomtom does n't bother to provide a backup on the cd so if you do n't first make your own backup before changing to the canadian map you ca n't later get the us map back
if tomtom 's maps fail and you submit a bug report the nice support site sends you to teleatlas 's site which promptly closes the support request it took two requests before i realized i was being redirected away from tomtom 's site the real problem is not with the maps which is a good thing but with the mapping engine determine how to find a point on a map i submit the request to the main support group only to have those bozos close the request saying that the problem is with the map at this point i do n't care who is wrong since neither tomtom nor teleatlas will say who owns the mapping engine this stupid device failed when i needed it the most driving in new jersey ! the tomtom go 300 can not map roads that are broken see bug submission below for more information so why two stars it fails when you need it i could scroll around the working map and find the right street but then i need to stop in an unsafe state er i mean place and use the device like it was my trusty aaa map support does not read bug reports i want that job with zero accountability please ! does it work yes it does and it does work very well when you have a nice clean streets with a good map it does take some time to find its gps often but its tolerable it manages to lose signal with tree cover seriously i can still see the sky moral of this review verify with an online map service before driving to unknown places defeats the prupose no tomtom go 300 did find my way around some detours in nj near trenton and get me into the parking garage saving me time and frustration the prupose of this device updates after using tomtom go 300 for a few months i have seen more problems than i care for i have recommended everyone in my family to not buy tomtom products the map for my area king of prussia pa more than two years out of date it got my dad lost going to a hotel which is 1.3 miles away from me in some areas you will fall off the map the most annoying new feature is tomtom alterate route functions i am headed to a fork in a road in the middle of nowhere tomtom wants me to take the long '' way to my destination by switching from the state route meaning route 1 or route 66 that i 'm on to the another state route at the fork the thing is if i tell it not to take the other state route the damn device will tell me to turn around ! ! once i pass the fork it keeps telling me to turn around when i choose to the routing software from where i am it figures out a new route completely passing the road that i need to take the road is on the tomtom map but it wo n't take it until i get on to it what gives bug report submitted to tomtom tomtom go 300 the mapping engine is broken it can not handle a road that is broken into several sections the city pennsauken gave several distinct streets the same name ! destination 3401 cooper ave pennsauken nj 08109 if you map the destination on any internet site and scroll around you would see that all points map to real locations but are not on the same physical road they are on different roads by the same name in the same city the tomtomgo 300 's map actually has these locations on it but is unable to map to anything but the first occurance of cooper ave 7200 cooper ave pennsauken nj 08109 trying to find the intersection cross street of two streets cooper ave and park ave does not work even though the tomtom 's map clearly shows that they do intersect tomtom can only see the intersection of cooper ave and derousse that area has several other streets sherman ave for example that are also
the tomtom has great features but i returned mine first the maps are very dated this makes it iffy at best it has terrific potential if it worked you can use a pda stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip it 's amazing but i wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it 's internal maps and waypoints but i tried a local test first i used roads as waypoints main roads this way i can force the tomtom to use my routes i did not like it 's choices since it is a dated map database i set up a local route and started to follow it it took me to the first no problem but it would not go past the first waypoint i would go down the road first waypoint then it would tell me to take a u turn ! i did then it said take another u turn it had me going in circles perhaps it 's not made to use roads as waypoints but all indications it gave were that it would the manual was no help support was no help so it went back i have ordered a garmin hope this is i have taken the same trip from se fl usa to sc usa with a garmin the garmin has maps that you can not update but got me to my destination no problem i do n't recommend this tomtom do research go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals hope this helps
i bought the original tom tom go back in november 2004. since then my attempts to reach their customer service have all met in failure my last attempt 10 days ago was an effort to buy updated maps for my product yes their website will offer to sell you maps but there is no way to determine the date of the maps you already own and no way to determine the date of the maps that you would be purchasing in some cases for a large sum of money if you try to find a telephone number on their site that you can call you will be disappointed i am disappointed and would advise you to look elsewhere if you want a product that is supported
i bought four of these and returned them immediately two were dead out of the box a third had horrible sound after searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products i finally settled on the 900 megahertz wireless intercom from radio shack beautiful sound well made and about half the price of the reporter pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet so if you need more than 300 feet for range it 's something to consider better warranty than the reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year anyway i could n't be happier with the rs intercom i just ca n't recommend the reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty
i replaced 4 novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 reporters attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter i was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands unfortunately the quality of the reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions do n't waste your money
i am very disappointed in this product i purchased the blue logger to use with a new dell axim which i purchased to use with the blue logger i found that i could not make a blue tooth connection between the blue logger and the handheld computer i contacted delorme was told at this time we do not offer any support or updates for windows mobile hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe '' what a ripoff delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present pc handheld operating system i have also found that i can not upload routes created on street atlas 2006 to the hand held basically i have a little electronic map with no functionality
i have so for used inav iguidance mapopolis navigon navigator 5 and the blue logger street atlas usa of all these the blue logger street atlas usa is the worst and inav iguidance is the best logger gps hardware is good but v impractical to use bcuz of its strange onoff button i will not recommend it to anyone waste of time and mone
i agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty the button is terrible it takes 5 tries to turn the unit off after 5 months of using this the unit would no longer talk '' with the satellites i sent it back to delorme it tested bad now i have waited 6 weeks for a replacement that is backordered customer service rep will not refund your purchase after 30 days ! the software claims it will compute driving routes for you but it will crash your pda instead i had to buy inav iguidance software which is outstanding to get software that will actually compute road routes for me i would not recommend this product to anyone it has been a complete waste of money for me
it is the year 2005. the century we 've put men on the moon we 've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system we can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets but we ca n't design a simply button the button for the blue logger is one of the most insanely stupid things i 've ever encountered some engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button seconds to turn it on and seconds to turn it off it does n't that difficult to do but in practice it is infuriating especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off right now the blue logger is sitting in front of me and i can not turn it off it simply will not turn off oh and i 've had lots of problems connecting it to my bluetooth adapter and have yet to get street atlas usa 2005 to recognize it
i am trying to get this to work for the last 2 weeks unfortunately without success i bought the bundle 3 bluelogger street atlas 2005 street atlas 2005 handheld the installation went fine but i had problems in hooking up to bluetooth i had to reset my hp ipaq 2215 several times in this process and my ibm 2.4 ghz and with ram was very slow not sure why this was once i got the laptop to work i took the blue logger out for a trip and downloaded the trip when i returned well i coud n't make sense out the data the blue logger logged the waypoints were almost all over the map this was not the route i took i am still within the guarantee and try to return it next week
i bought the blue logger and both street atlas 2005 and hh for my dell no problem with the blue logger gps but my complaints are as follows 1. delorme did not include the blue logger manager software on the hh now they want to sell it separately for additional 39 very weird marketing strategy indeed 2. the software for the pocket pc is very difficult to use not very intuitive it seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc it is poorly designed and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market 3. it is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route even with a 620 mhz axim it is slow worse yet the route is often wrong for example this afternoon i use to determine a route to a friend 's house had i followed that route i would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination luckily i decided to use my paper map later i tried microsoft mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing last week for another location found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off luckily i knew where it was and ignored the routing from hh 4. many other mapping softwares for hh will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger but not with hh after 2 weeks of using it i found myself going back to my old paper map for example if i had not calculated a route and just simply use the gps and map to travel the software only show the street i was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets it does not help when you are lost 5. maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date i guess that 's why delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue i am seriously considering giving up and consider this as my 50 learning mistake and looking at microsoft street trip 2005 or later in 2005 iguidance who is supposed to have the latest map i am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum i wish i had read that forum before buying delorme software well live and learn
i have owned this little hub for at least a year i have an older pc which came without usb so i added a pci adapter i soon realized that i needed more ports and more convenience than the two now located in the backplane of the pc on the floor i shopped around and this item looked appropriate as for the short cord i solved that issue by getting a usb extension cord at the same time besides solving the immediate problem this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point and using the extension cord for some other purpose for a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do i attached an external hard drive through it i used it for a compact flash card reader and a digital camera i connected an inkjet printer everything worked once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly this was all with windows 98 se but after a while things started getting less reliable the system would tell me that various drives '' on the flash card reader or the external hard drive were not available or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software and the printer even started disappearing playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life and eventually i deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose or with wiring inside the device either way it has finally become a big problem and i am shopping for a replacement most of the devices i connected were that is they did not need to draw power from the hub or the pci channel at all the hard drive camera and printer were all powered by batteries or ac adapters of their own and the flash card reader which did draw power from the hub used to work fine it does not matter what combination of devices i try sooner or later the connection goes bad it is of course possible that there 's something wrong in the pc but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself so i have to recommend against buying it i suspect it is discontinued and that this advice wo n't be necessary for much longer but i want to prevent somebody from the bother i 've been through just in case
save yourself time and aggravation and do n't buy this product ! i bought this to put home movies on dvd almost every time i downloaded a home movie to my computer the audio was not in sync with the video i spent hours trying to get it right i also kept upgrading my computer thinking that was the problem i finally saw a review here explaining that the is notorious for this problem so i bought a canopus and have not had a single problem !
this amazon listing also suggests buying the soundsticks along with airport express if you 're thinking of connecting them to the usb port of express apple says it wo n't work apple airport express faqs
bought this from amazon worked well for compact flash cards always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card from kodak camera so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera and all of a sudden it died on me had to throw it out
i received this as a christmas gift and while it 's compact there are a couple of major flaws the power button is the only thing on the remote that works none of the other controls on the remote work second it 's very basic i would have preferred something that had some sleep '' or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control the only positive comments i have about this are that it 's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf and it charges the ipod really quickly when it 's docked otherwise the sound is mediocre and the controls suck
i bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas with this in mind i have to say that i found the sound to be poor even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak i did like the fact that it accommodated my older generation ipod and had several attachments for the various versions of ipods i bought it because it did accept my older ipod and because of the price but i sent it back and bought the which has great sound and accepts my old ipod for a price that is not that much more
i tried to install the driver on my computer the computer went into a loop just booting shutting down and rebooting i was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point i 'm scared to try it again any body want it i 'll sell it cheap for that matter just pay the postage and it 's yours
i got this from jnr this unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it i tried this on multiple computers may be this was just a lemon i will exchange it to a better brand
this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment
too many disadvantages 1. no battery backup 2. even on the brightest setting the clock are barely visible from the distance 3. you 'd be expecting better sound from this unit it 's acceptable with the radio but cd sound quality is extremely poor 4. etc
bought new around 80 cd player and lcd clock stopped working within 6 months now nap function and radio are all that works if only i could find the damn receipt ! ! !
i have had nothing but trouble with this product no matter how many times i have dowload new or older drivers the installation is never complete their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem though they have tried i will not spend money on another dlink product
install went smooth on my inspiron notebook everything worked fine for 24 hours then it just stopped worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere this thing is junk i 'm sending it back
from looking at the website and talking to five tech support staff it appears that there are countless versions of this card each with different driver software the one i got came with a cd with the wrong drivers with tech support i finally found the 8 mb driver file i was supposed to download however they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver the normal automatic '' approach did not work and their instructions did not match the screens i was getting on windows xp sp 2. so i called back again and again and again despite being given a case file each time i was asked the same questions including what exactly is wrong and each time i was told to do the same thing install from the cd reboot remove the program reboot install from the new driver reboot remove the program talk to a senior tech support person install from cd reboot etc it would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the cd a clearly designed website would be second best and tech support that knows what they 're doing and speaks intelligble english would be a nice last resort i spent three hours calling technical support and speaking to five people and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card ! i am not alone in this experience see cnet 's web site user reviews of the another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system i believe he is right it appears to have damaged my screen font for windows message boxes i have been unable to repair it the is bad news i give them two stars cause they actually have tech support though in this case it was utterly worthless back it goes
i have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that i did or else they wrote their review too soon i bought mine in june 2006. it failed before the store warranty ran out one down the replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and would n't boot two down sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free rma that one also failed three down they replaced it with both a and a the hung after about 2 weeks four down i have been using the for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the replacement arrives i have gotten quite good at the rma game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or i get one of those that other people rave about i do n't think i 'll buy another sandisk unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty i suggest that everyone with a failed to exercise thier warranty rights sandisk needs to know the true reliability of their products
after few months of using it it started to lag badly and the scroll wheel stopped working i 'll never buy logitech mouse again
we have been unsuccessful with this attachment since we purchased it cards read once and never again does n't matter if we use the gb sp or advance still does n't do anything do n't recommend you waste your money
looks slick decent sound and great price but flimsy attenna and cd player broke after 1 week on its own i did n't even open it up after loading in the first group of cds took it to jvc repair and they could n't fix it or find out was wrong ruined my impression of jvc remember the wisdom you get what you pay for ''
this is the worst thing i have ever owned ! ! ! ! it broke said there were no cd 's inside after about a week ! do yourself a favor do n't get this product do n't buy this brand and do n't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too
pros it 's pretty cons it 's garbage sure wished i had checked here at amazaon before i bought this i ca n't believe jvc put out such garbage ! so many of these cd players have broken that they ca n't keep up with the replacement parts 5 week wait ! ! i guess i was one of the luckier ones mine lasted almost 2 months before it died bottom line if you have n't bought yet look elsewhere if you have keep your receipt and warranty
like many others here my died after a couple of weeks and it would n't read any cd it 's in for repair but they say the changer part is on national back order and they do n't know when they will be available no surprise i guess given the number that are breaking the jvc parts web site says the changer is not available for more than 3 weeks '' i hope they will replace my unit with something that works
great appearance and sound jvc has produced a nice sounding unit speakers look as great as they sound no problem handling bass at loud levels tuner is very easy to use usb input works flawlessly now the bad news the cd mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any cd whether store bought or burned first unit died after three weeks the replacement lasted five cd player mechanical design is unable to handle light use will think twice about buying a jvc
notice all the happy star ratings are from people that just bought this i have had mine for 9 months i have had this since christmas 2005. i bought the white 512 for my son at the same time whith in 3 weeks my son 's was no longer working at all he had it in his back pack and some how it got crunched enough to never work again ! ! i was not happy also in a few months mine started to have issues the very tiny '' menu button is rediculous and the main toggle was a complete failure for sony i accually removed the cover to the toggle and just moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volume how stupid i am so mad about this player i am going to buy a creative i have done a lot of research this time and i will not buy another sony the hold button that is part of this sliding door never works i find the player dead in my gym bag all the time ! ! ! apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turn on for hours and than you have a dead player maybe sony should have given us a button than this would not happen ! dont do it folks look into other options even my mom 's ipod nano is better designed than this joke of an player
the bean is small battery efficient and has a nice overall look to it thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product this is not an player it is a trac player you have to convert all your 's into trac format before the player is able to play them you also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your hd can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take if your looking for an player that lets you just drag and drop your fav into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you this device is the stalin of player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs
first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphones always pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel ! ! ! ! !
hardware awesome software a flop since you have to use their software the package is destroyed i will give you the final nail on the coffin for me i tried to put podcasts on the device using the latest sonicstage 4. no chance it wants to be able to find each artist '' in the sony library this was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library i had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend no chance now shame as the hardware was
i loved this player until the day i really really needed to use it for recording when i discovered that the mode button no longer worked this is the button you need to use to switch from player mode to voice record record or fm radio the device is now permanently stuck on player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat which is not the worst thing in the world except that i specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now for all intents and purposes and 14 months after i bought it too conveniently the screws holding the case together are impossible to remove so there 's no way to attempt a diy solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable problem this thing is of no use to me now a 200 paperweight i 'm never buying another iriver product again
i purchased one of these when new back in 2004. the unit has worked ok for me with the main quirk being about once every hour or two i go through a 3 5 minute period of bad reception presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another i was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from crutchfield my main issue with this unit is that there are newer units available for the same or slightly more money which have replay options and better displays i would consider those options before purchasing this unit
i purchased this receiver in december 2005. it worked like a champ until february 2006 when it began to have issues with decoding the satellite signal the unit works for five minutes from cold start up then the audio cuts out display still shows program info being an experienced pc user i turned the unit off and back on repeatedly the message acquiring signal '' displays permanently even though the antenna aiming screen shows full sat and ter signal bars my best guess is that a rom or ram chip cooked this unit runs hot ! jvc has been less than helpful it sucks to have to landfill a 100 piece of hardware but no one will touch it it 's my last purchase from jvc glad i did n't purchase the sirius lifetime '' license
first of all i thought sat radio advertised commercial free radio '' was that it is not at all ! ! ! ! in fact i spend most of my time looking over the 160 chanels for something not with commercials they claim they have nothing to do with that so this is a good buy if you want another radio player with commercials a lot of them and to pay for it i got this because i was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing so keep this in mind before you buy
i recently bought this radio primarily for my car but also got the home dock it was easy to set up and install both types of kit unfortunately the sound quality was very poor in both configurations the fm modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless it only has maybe 10 channels i found one that was free luckily but even with a clear channel the sound had a terrible hiss that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary the occupied channels actually worked about as well still lots of hiss except when the underlying channel broke through even disregarding the hiss the sound quality on the music was not very good i thought the problem was probably with the fm modulator so i tried it in the home dock connected to a home system the hiss was gone but the sound quality was completely unacceptable for whatever reason this particular receiver does n't like the compression artifacts very much satellite radio quality is at best about like an average with highly compressed signals some channels better than others this receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string telephone '' most of the time it was vert irritating very quickly the form factor about the size of a modern was fine and pretty easy to fit in the car it also seemed to be pretty solidly built but all of that is completely moot if it does n't work properly i returned the receiver and both kits the next day
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
i purchased for about 8 the replacement plan for electronics products on and after one call on about to the seller i still have received anything john
i previously attempted to use this device with my mac pro i run the machine with windows xp and mac os x tiger with tiger the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my aluminum cinema display simply unplug the hub and the machine happily goes to sleep with windows xp the machine does not recognize my microsoft ergo keyboard 4000 until i disconnect the keyboard from the hub then reconnect it ironically the keyboard works fine under os x when connected to the hub i guess i got what i paid for a piece of junk 7 port hub for under 30 i have reverted back to using my port hockey puck '' style belkin usb 2.0 hubs no problems with those
cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top poorly designed it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it putting it together was a pain the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes designed doesnt even fit cds that well there are gaps and the cd casses are loose fitting pros i guess it can hold a lot of cds
it 's a nice look but it tips over very easily it is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows my advice is if you need a cd rack that holds a lot of cd 's save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy

i have no clue what this little thing is about dummy me thought i bought a nice little tv but it reminds me of those little cards you 'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand the image changed that 's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show you can not watch this thing with somebody else seated say 15 feet away from you the other person or you gets a foggy image or just dark shapes up close you see hardly anything buyers beware this is not a working tv one star for the batteries in the remote
i bought this thing because i lost a memory mod to a power surge it worked fine at first but now it has no battery life recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately like it was not on a backup at all of course the alarm was still screaming but so what my computer was already shut off without any warning i had this thing for two years but i will be going with a different brand next time
i knew these were inexpensive cd cases but i ca n't even open one without it breaking into two
i just cam from las vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that does n't allow for more photos after only using i have tried to format the disk using the camera and through windows xp it does n't allow it to be formatted bad investment ! ! ! would not recommend the product unless there is a way i can get a refund or an exchange
not functional if you are reading this then you are ! and you and i must be family first i love amazon they are the consistent type of and that 's good ! but but but but why would a designated by me upper echelon '' merchant like amazon carry this sandisk compact flash card type i it simply is not functional information that i stored sandisk compact flash card type i is gone or not readable i am surprised that amazon did not with the problem the product wo n't retain any info then i had to store less and less information on the card so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours i decided to contact amazon they were very shortly and cordially sent me a replacement sandisk compact flash card type i with the paperwork for returning the original sandisk compact flash card type i then i got something that did have the shape of a sandisk cf card did have the sandisk label that says sandisk compact flash card type i and did have the original shiny factory sandisk package 3 different computers later and 2 hour had passed could n't recognize what is inserted into the cf reader the brand new replacement card i got with the original factory wrapping that 's brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers one may safely assume pardon the facetiousness sandisk compact flash card type i is yet to be recognized from amazon twice in the mail i got a sandisk 2 gb compact which flash card type i both cards i received had a problem and therefore it is safe to assume that sandisk compact flash card type i production have a major glitch i mean the memory card can not be used for memory purposes i have to yet see what or for what other than memory can i utilize a memory card i beg your pardon but in essence i am trying to imply that the sandisk products were a joke ! SMILE being the consistent that amazon always been amazon agreed to return them this was not a surprise coming from amazon in essence i strongly urge any person that makes a living and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to 1. not be fooled if you see sandisk run away as fast as possible 2. you 'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so 3. sandisk compact flash card type i is not compatible with data storage ! or even short transfers of data from a home computer to work 4. spend the extra on an alternative brand 5. that 's the only way you 'll get a cf card that is correctly labeled and serve intended functions 6. i strongly recommend as well as urge individual who is thinking of getting that other '' brand of cards to make sure do so 7. use amazon only and do n't be fooled by any other who 's not as high of an echelon as amazon amazon ! 8. had it not been for amazon i would have lost all i paid SMILE god bless amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness i also pray for sandisk so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line god bless and keep on shopping
the second disc in this package was faulty which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best i have switched to maxell
replaced first spindle and still junk will always stick with verbatim from now on
i was deeply disappointed for buying stuff from memorex not a single dvd was usable in the pack never gon na buy anything from memorex !
i bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site i was very pleased with the purchase then i did n't have one problem with the discs i bought another pack recently and i 've been using the pack i just bought all of the discs are messing up for me i can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you i wish i could send these discs back and get a refund this purchase has scared me away from anything else related to memorex i thought memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers i guess i was wrong and apparently you get what you pay for do n't be fooled by the good price you 'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that would n't even be worth using as a frisbee find another brand to use and avoid this brand
was a little hard putting it together you have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart i am not happy with this product
the main reason i bought this kit was for the label applicator the software was secondary good thing that i did n't care about how good the software would be because the software for this is in a word deplorable it does n't have support for any other label sheets other than the memorex brand which leaves you stuck with their labels its got some nice features in the software but their poorly implemented for instance it can automatically resize an image to fit a but if you 've rotated it before that the rotation is lost it has a lot of minor quirks like that and they add up to an annoyance to use this if you get this product find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator
the labels are sticky on one side and printable on the other but that 's about all this product has going for it the software is a nightmare the print previews only vaguely represent the finished product and the program frequently and randomly alters your image i wound up using the labels but creating the documents in ms publisher what a shame
first of all despite the claim that it works with macintosh it definately does not there is a template that you can use in mac with word claris and other photoshop software but there are no instructions as to how once you think you have it figured out on the page it does n't print the same as pictured the technial support people have no idea how to make it work with mac and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers in any case they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the word template for macintosh do n't waste your money i gave it one star only because no stars is not an option
beware of kingston rebates ! of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product s but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a 50 rebate i promptly as in the day after i received the item delivery went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer think huge online the rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of 1 business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer '' well now what i ca n't the original it was already in their possession i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another 6 weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply would n't honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i could n't really submit to their requirements if you 're looking for a ram upgrade i 'd suggest you look at a quality company like ocz the best ! or patriot geil or corsair if you 're looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams
my review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently for some months after i first bought the card it worked great now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my canon elph and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card judging by what other customers have written i 'm suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between canon cameras and viking cards in any case i will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a viking
after serveral months of use card error '' was shown on my canon digital rebel for my viking card which was half full with pictures fortunately i just lost a few of pictures i tried to format the file card error '' kept occuring on my rebel this viking card is now used for my data files probably viking cards are not designed for high mega pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time 3 my canon has no problems when used with the viking card so far probably i am going to buy a card from sandisk or simple tech
i have had a canon since 2002. i used to use viking 128 mb cf cards and had no problem in october 2004 i bought one viking cf card from amazon i did not use it until this summer after i had taken 20 more photos and reviewed i immediately found a few images corrupted no matter how i tried format the cf before use there were alway corrupted images i wonder if i can return the defect cf card and get a replacement from amazon or from manufacturer sherwood count
i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups and the last 5 or so failed i thought it was my software so i got new software guess what my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed too it 's not my burner as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read as it 's brand new and does n't require the firmware upgrade they mention they just suck and have a high failure rate so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best i 'm buying some now and save myself the frustration
the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality the only problem is that for every 3 good burns i get one bad one i 'm using the plextor dvd burner love it ! ! but i 'm going to try my luck with a different dvd brand the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable it 's less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters
i hope it 's live because if it 's memorex it 's crap ! that 's my latest opinion after using this product i have a liteon and it hates memorex i rarely get a decent burn more often than not i 'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it my movies will skip stutter or stop all together so disappointing ! unfortunately i found out too late that memorex uses cmc media which only has a success rate !
i 'm afraid i have to agree with the other previously happy memorex users in noting that memorex rate has gone downhill i was skeptical when i read the other reviews and i stuck with memorex but i have seen the light now for a year i was very successful with the memorex disks in the 25 pack spindles i would buy they would all work in aug i bought 2 25 packs at circuit city a mistake that appears to have been a waste of money i just tried to burn a copy of something and i ended up trashing 4 disks in a row i was convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else then i remembered someone had given me a blank sony disk so i thought what the heck let me try that one into the sony drive it went and it copied without a hitch that was the final straw for my memorex loyalty out of a pack of 25 i have about 10 left but have had to trash 6 of the 15 i used not a good success ratio bye memorex
i 've previously purchased memorex media and have not had any problems until recently my latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price where do i start how about the fact that the media is labeled as and only burns at gray spindle how about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption video dropouts stutter or dvd i thought it was my recorder until i read all the reviews there has been a huge drop in quality recently if you want to gamble with the recent quality of the memorex branded media and hope '' every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here for me i 'm dumping more than 50 remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters
i purchased this and am not impressed note that works with all click wheel ipods '' is n't true it does not work with photo ipods at least the 60 gb model i 'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit i 'm ordering a 'photo dock ' since i ca n't see any way to get a cover that is made for the model if i 'd known this i 'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately since i already have a charger came with it grr
99.99 list price over 70 actual price you 've got to be kidding ! i never accuse companies of raping consumers because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance if you want to connect your ipod to your home stereo get a 7.00 stereo to rca plug '' at radio shack that 's all you need because you already have a recharger it came with your ipod the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your ipod upright i have this item it came free with my ipod and although it offers a slight convenience over not having it the price is a terrible
this is basically a '' male to rca cable for 73 you could get the same exact cable for 5.99 at radio shack yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out not worth it buy the cable at rs it 'll work exactly the do n't be fooled if you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately you 'll save major
heres a new one have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer imac intel outdated simply doesnt recognize i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far as i can tell from which i burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one ! for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas
at less than a dollar per sparkly frisbee this is the best price i can find for frisbees they do n't fly very well and they break relatively easily but this is the best value i can find for 100 frisbees in one place a lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable cd media the problem with that is they do n't work very well for that either i too tested this for myself using nero burning rom i tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs just like you 're supposed to it worked ! it burned fine then it took 5 minutes to open a simple html document on the burned disc subsequent trials run with the verify written data '' checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning it 's like writing with a white crayon except this is white paper this persisted on several other computers with different cd burner drives and even different software i finally realized what great frisbees these things are cheer up people they are great fun ! so grab your spindle go outside and start chucking these things at your neighbor 's annoying dog ps i need to sue memorex for selling this junk these disc are just a form of abuse
the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode in my experience with sandisk i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted so you get rebate 50 of the time with sandisk i think is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies do n't trust it !
i purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight my husband and i both used them and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes they were great at first but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears the inside of my ears were so sore i could n't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out that 's how bad my ears hurt i had the foam pad over them too and it made no difference i would not recommend these
i bought this mouse a couple months ago to use with my macbook pro i loved it until a couple days ago when it decided to stop working it 's not connecting to the usb adapter any more i changed the battery and tried the connect button and nothing sad is n't it
this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i would n't take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate
while i read the reviews on this machine it is clear to me that lexar has some serious problems for some people it worked for others it was a miserable failure i am in the latter group sigh mine was dead on arrival i tried the device with of my machines and in both cases it was unrecognized lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help
i got this item and it worked for about 4 hours then stopped working i tried the reader in 2 different computers nothing i contacted lexar customer support and they could n't help me save your money and buy something else
i used this reader for a week before it stopped working it worked ok for the week that it worked at all it would not read xd cards though it did not detect that a card was inserted at all i tried inserting the card fully partially and even tried jiggling it a little it seemed like the contacts on the card were touching the contacts on the reader but it would not recognize that a card was inserted it did however work with my compact flash card then inexplicably it stopped functioning entirely i unplugged it and plugged it back in and scanned for hardware changes in device manager but the card was dead i tried plugging it into another computer and it was not detected at all lexar support left a lot to be desired i explained the problem in detail and the response i got was a generic try restarting the computer etc etc '' then they wanted me to pay for shipping to rma their defective merchandise i sent it back to amazon instead and got my money back i 'm willing to assume that i just got a lemon but the piss poor tech support convinced me to get a refund rather than a replacement
i recently received this as a christmas gift and it did n't work from the start after much time wasted with their tech support '' the device was deemed defective their tech support is very poor all they could say try another xd card '' the device kept freezing my system the driver that came with the software did n't work a very frustrating experience if the tech support was more informative or supportive lexar might have redeemed itself i recently purchased the sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm right from the start their quick start guide is much more detailed and their software works ! save yourself a headache and buy sandisk
the lexar media 2.0 can not function smoothly with a one gigabyte card from olympus the help site explains how with my mac i can reboot my computer in os 9 classic then download the pictures then reboot in os not a satisfactory solution i felt screwed on discovering this after the purchase i feel like i simply acquired electronic junk there was no response from lexar when i emailed support which simply added to my feeling of being had
at first i was happy to be able to purchase a printer for such a low price however the price should be even lower for this pile of junk every time i attempt to print i spend several minutes trying to feed it paper the printer will intake several pieces of paper at the same time instead of just one and it will jam up even if i just feed it one piece of paper at a time it will often still jam on just one piece of paper printing should not be this hard these problems have occurred since i first purchased the printer i regret purchasing this printer as i should have went with a higher end model i 've lost respect for hp products because of the poor quality of this printer
i detest this printer i 've bought quite a few printers in my day lexmark canon and have been quite happy with most hp 's but this was the pits the first one i brought home worked fine the first time but when i tried to turn it on the next day it would n't cut on it just died on me i unplugged it plugged it back it then it worked for a little while before dying again this time for good i returned it got another one same problem except this time it keeps going all i have to do is unplug it before each and every time i turn it on nice huh now i 'm browsing online again and i 've learned my lesson for sure no more el cheapo models i 'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two
as the other reviewer found out these cards ca n't be formatted to work with sd audio total waste of money
i am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices however with my panasonic player this product was not compatible i could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to sd audio support
i do n't understand why people spend money on this charger when you can pay half as much for the same thing i bought an ipod charger for my ipod video from sonnet technologies and i am very satisfied it is small and the connectors retract for easy carrying around search amazon for sonnet usb wall charger for ipod with cable '' at about half the price it comes in black or white to go with the color of your ipo
i have a usb ac charger and car charger that came with my palm pda and they work just fine with my nano do n't waste your money supporting apple when it charges 30 for basically a piece of plastic
i do not like this item because it says it is a dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a burner so if you are looking for do not buy this one
in each pack there have been several dvd 's that are n't any good too many bad discs in my opinio
it would not download it just stopped about the way through i will have to send it back
it worked file with win but as soon as i switched to windows xp this device was rendered utterly useless to me it wo n't shut down or eject and windows explorer wo n't see it grrrrrrrr
it 's been over 19 days since my sandisk transflash card was shipped '' from emartbuy and i still have not received my order when i contacted emartcrap all they could tell me was that it had been shipped i am sure that flash card works great i just hope that i will receive it before it becomes obsolete avoid emartbuy at all cost do n't settle for incompetency your are better off paying a higher price for better service correction any service
start off with the bad news i have a motorola dvr converter box with my comcast cable service and the comcast remote sends the ads box into gonzo fits attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ads box to switch inputs using the cable dvr button cycles the ads through screen formats with each button push etc i contacted ads tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time obviously this is not acceptable too bad because this box does a much better job than my philips cineos at upscaling tivo analog cable dvd laserdisc all look better the improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle but definitely not worth it if you have a motorola cable box that will conflict 5 stars for video quality 3 stars for user interface which is not so great subtract all but 1 star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict
this charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully i thought that my rechargable batteries were out of life '' but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully my daughter brought home a cheap sakar overnight charger when visiting i popped in a set of batteries i thought were done for and found them to be just fine using her sakar charger what happens on my charger is that the lights indicating that the batteries have been fully charged all go off and the batteries are cool to the touch '' indicating that they have been fully recharged nope ! only about half way recharged
i was impressed with the charger for about 1 month it stopped charging the nimh batteries it came with i took it back to best buy only to find that all of the rapid chargers on thier shelf did not work either a sales person and i tested them all hoping i would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked it was more disappointing after calling kodak were unable to replace it or get my money back i thought purchasing a kodak was a smart decision however they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing
while traveling in china i hooked up this charger to a sharper image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking a much better buy would be the sony charger with worldwide voltage and for 5 dollars less
i have two of these chargers that i bought directly from kodak for about 10 each each of them came with 4 aaa batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package one of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use battery charger technology is not all that complicated but kodak does n't seem to have mastered it yet no wonder they were practically giving these away i 'd avoid purchasing these now at any price
i bought this charger 11 months ago it came with 4 kodak 1850 ma nimh batteries after a few months of light use the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 ma batteries should if i use the batteries immediately after charging them i can take about 20 pictures while my 2000 ma nimh batteries can do 60 if i charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves they wo n't be useful after only a week the charger is capable of charging both aa and aaa batteries but a few months ago 1 spring for switching between aa and aaa stopped working properly this was after very light use i only charge aaa batteries once a month the market for nimh batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago i would not buy this kodak if i were to buy today
this worked fine at first but after a few months the charger could not hold the aaa batteries in place the spring mechanisms failed for 3 out of the 4 positions that would hold the aaa batteries thus i could no longer charge the aaa batteries then after a while the charger just quit working all together
briefly i have four stations and they never really worked right i presume because of the need to be on the same circuit i want to replace them now but i 'm not sure i 'd buy this brand again
just purchased 3 units thought they would work as well as the novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range my original novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn these only work in the same room i am attempting to return these currently
i just purchased a set of two 4 channel westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently if i tipped one of the units it worked sometimes as though it had a bad connection i am trying to return them now to the seller good luck if you purchase a set of these they seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set
i bought a set of four westinghouse intercoms usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and do n't want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people these westinghouse intercoms and i believe the same goes for the novi intercoms require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit that is controlled by the same electrical breaker so if your kitchen family room master bedroom and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system the westinghouse system will not work for you intercoms are usually for large houses large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets hence this product likely will not work for most people i replaced the westinghouse intercom system with one by another manufacturer called the wirefree intercom reporter this is a four channel system and it works great works either with batteries or transformer it is independent of the electrical circuits
this is not technically a review although based on what i 've read i do plan on buying one of these however i found something on which will the two main circuits that most houses have thus allowing devices like this and work from any outlet to any other this is not yet tested by me but is at least promising device is here http explanation is here http
beware of kingston rebates ! of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product s but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a 50 rebate i promptly as in the day after i received the item delivery went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer think huge online the rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of 1 business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer '' well now what i ca n't the original it was already in their possession i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another 6 weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply would n't honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i could n't really submit to their requirements if you 're looking for a ram upgrade i 'd suggest you look at a quality company like ocz the best ! or patriot geil or corsair if you 're looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams
i did not read the prior reviews i bought this item loaded the software that came with it in the sealed box from the mfg software disc contains two viruses one in quicktime the other in totally hip files target has been notified that the software is corupt with viruses that the mfg has gone out of business this item is only useful as a drawing tablet thru other software programs like paint shop pro as there is no web site access or tech support available for this item
i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs about 150 of them i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i purchased this item and was excited to get them but burning my first they 're all coasters ! pass memorex and go for a more expensive media like verbatim
bad bad bad i 'm not sure exactly what is wrong with these discs whether it is flimsy material or an asymmetrical center but they are not reliable i purchased a 50 spindle and from the first 28 used only one worked properly this is an expensive waste i suggest going with better quality discs at the outset it will save on headache later
i would avoid these discs i have been using these discs for some time doing backups recently i 've had a few problems and decided to look at these further i noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the memorex brand as are others like tdk i used to dvd info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by cmc and i 'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors one disk has strange ring in the die i have the nec burner i also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer less trouble playing on my sony dvd player just based on this not a clear indication of what you 're getting when you purchase i would go with something else these discs are not cheap enough for this reason
i would like to believe that this hub works but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info 5 volt 2.1 amp center positive i 've been to two radio shacks and they do n't carry it i 'm upset any advice
this product only works for light scratches and greasy dirt and grime it could be better if the polishing heads rotated at a much faster speed and applied more pressure the polishing fluid is also not very good better is compound from an autobody paint store acrylic is acrylic essentially it lacks power i 've polished to a shine deeply scratched cds and dvds using an automotive paint polishing machine this tool is a waste of time and money if they powered it up for 50.00 more than i would probably buy one commercial cd polishers are available but for a couple of hundred dollars
the machine does fine for quick cleaning of your 's i ca n't give a complete review of the product because i only tried to repair 1 dvd and it did not repair it
as far as i can tell this thing does n't work at all i have now tried it on 3 cds and it did not repair any of them i should have just replaced the cds
i used the repair feature one time and the unit would never turn on again and the disc i did do the repair on still did n't work do n't waste your money on this
how do i assign a rating as several other people have experienced my unit is also doa i received it plugged it in pressed 'clean ' and the motor started up i popped open the cover put in the disc i wanted cleaned and pressed 'clean ' again nothing terrible quality control what 's worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty
i purchased this flash card in june for my gps memory loaded fine but only lasted 3 months card lost all it 's memory and was unable to take a new load very disappointed in the life of the card
it did n't work properly from the time it came out of the box the carousel would n't make a complete rotation so cds and dvds would get 'trapped ' inside the unit and occasionally it would simply refuse to play a dvd altogether panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop so maybe they can get it to function as it should if you do purchase one please read the warranty carefully a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones under any circumstances
i have purchased three of these dvd players in the past 2 years every one of them has had the same problems trouble reading dvds dvds skipping discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units the price is right on the unit but not for the time it worked i would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than 6 months without a problem if i could give it less than 1 star i would because thats really what it is worth nothing
i bought this player because i wanted to play dvds from various regions the good news is that it plays discs from all regions outside of region 1 just as well as it plays those in region 1. the bad news is that i never found a disc which the unit could play through in its entirety it would click grind and sputter along for 30 or on a good day 50 minutes before just freezing up save your money or buy a coby which is an infinitely superior unit
this dvd player is potentially a great cheap and versatile machine but the two i bought from worldwide distributers were faulty i have a friend who owns a 300 which works perfectly with my region 2 english dvds i have a cyberhome dvd player in england which works perfectly as well the two machine i received didnt work very well and didnt play some discs at all this is why i would recommend spending a bit more on another machine after returning two players i decided to buy a philips multiformat dvd player with divx windows media support which with a code to allow it to play all regions works perfectly ! it cost 60 with free shipping through amazon so was n't actually much more expensive than the other player ! see the reviews of this player for the code ! i would also like to say that there was nothing wrong with the service from worldwide distributors and that they refunded most of the shipping costs the problem was only with the dvd players they sent me
bad disc error possible fix after about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working i kept getting bad disc error on a new dvd i bought i tried good discs that worked before but now got the same bad disc error this is not the first time i had problems loading previously unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem this time after two weeks of bad disc errors i was about to toss it when i decided what the heck i 'll check inside to see if it 's dirty or something first i unplugged the unit i removed the 6 screws holding the cover you may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off with my expertise knowledge i nudged the lense mechanism it apparently slides to read the discs i plugged the dvd in and loaded a disc again to see what happens the lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc i 'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day ! lol so hopefully this will last a little longer but at least i can use it again for now i am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error the viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers
it came with the stickers all peeling off used it for about a month and the item failed on me then the bad news it blew the fuses in my car and all my electronics stopped working tried it on a friends car and i blew his fuses car and person look for something else seems to be a common problem update linksys replaced this product instantly works but a little worried it will fail again update on update died again
this item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets do n't waste your money on this piece of crap
the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded
about a year ago i got one of these to allow me to play dvds for my kids on my laptop while travelling it has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately i figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs i had n't tried to use it since now that i 'm taking another trip i thought i 'd try it out in other cars no luck the thing is dead does n't do a thing when i plug it in
this unit failed to provide reliable power to my new toshiba satellite laptop it cycled on and off every 3 seconds it powered a 100 watt lamp okay but would n't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 and is rated at 140 watts continuous my laptop power supply is rated at input at vac and if it drew constantly i agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter however even at that power demand the inverter should run it for but only manages 3 sec in addition i doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously i talked to linksys support and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund so i did it did not work for me maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts but i would n't recommend it for more than that
the first unit worked ok for about a month but then just stopped transmitting if you unplugged it and plugged it back in again it would work for about 5 minutes and then stop again returned it for a replacement and the exact same thing happened in 2 weeks returned second unit for credit and will buy something else both units had a lot of static even at low to moderate volume level
i bought these headphones to watch tv while on the treadmill they do n't work at all for that purpose interference from the motor causes them to they work great when i stop the treadmill
i was very interested in buying this product even before it came out but i have to say i am disappointed this product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill i say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run this product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is i am a fan of apple products have owned 4 ipod 2 ibooks an imac and a macmini but after buying this product i have decided to sell it because it does n't do any thing that can do on your own i do n't think that my mind would change if they added a heart monitor because you know that they for that probably into the range i have been running for the past 3 months on a daily basis and have run and half marathons in the past
i never recieved any replacement paln informtion regarding my warenty i had customer service email stating they would send me the paperwork for the plan but never did ii sure hope when i need to use it i will be able to
each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data do n't waste your money on this one
this product stinks typically the documentation is not written in standard english but in some that no civilized person understands their support material is exhaustive and exhausting and solves no user problem i bought it primarily for book reading and so far have not been able to access a single one the desktop manager '' tells me the synchronization '' went ok but that proves to be false the stories i downloaded are nowhere to be found i look under franklin reader and find nothing i look under mobi reader and find the same i do n't need another calculator or memo book or solitaire game or voice recorder or player or phone book i wanted a portable library for fiction nonfiction whatever and this gadget will not give it to me if you remember the seinfeld episode in which the foreign professor threw the electronic organizer out the window you have an idea of what i feel like doing with this thing i bought it from a clearance company on ebay for 50 bucks so it 's not a huge loss but i did want an ebook reader apparently there are a lot of ebooks online for the taking or buying but i 'll never see them not with the franklin ebookman anyway and i 'm certainly not going in search of another device once burned twice shy
when trying to download information to the ipod i keep getting error messages reading ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the ipod sometimes the software will recognize the ipod and other times it wo n't i have installed and reinstalled the software several times but it does not seem to fix the problem
while the price for this hts is very nice the performance is substandard there 's a hissing sound when the unit is off the dvd player has trouble playing dvds i have a large dvd collection most of them do n't play the surround quality is also very poor it 's a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers do n't put out much sound in order to get this serviced i have to send it out for up to 3 months i bought a progressive dvd player put the audio through the phillips hts 3400 and the video to the tv and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better
it came down to a choice between a 40 sound system with a seperate dvd player or this 200 system the reason i purchased it was because it would save on space well it may save on space but the functionality was reduced to nearly zero the cons popped in and out when playing cd 's also a cracking sound when it actually played the audio especially from the rear speakers when the unit was turned off volume from the rear speakers n't play many dvd 's right it would just stop as if it could n't read it not read 's picture it did this on all dvd 's played every few seconds it was an intermittent length of time between ocurrences it looked as if it would drop a few frames the audio never varied from being spot on but it looked as if the player could n't keep up with the dvd this is what killed it for me this could be because of a defective unit however i will not be risking my money on another philips player the pros audio output that 's about it my expectations were disappointed horribly i will not be buying another philips if i can help it at all instead i bought a sony slimline dvd player 75 with a 40 sound system and it is far superior far and it plays
july 2005 i was looking for a dvd player for my bedroom at costco and could n't resist the 179 price for this brand new philips is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than i played some dvds and cds and after 2 days i decided to return it for 2 reasons 1. it makes a hissing sound when it 's turned off now it would n't bother me too much in a basement althought it would still be anoying but it 's a definite no no in the bedroom 2. rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them if you do n't mind these 2 things then by all means go for it aug 2005 update having nothing better to do i went and purchased another unit from costco to see if indeed i have a bad unit or it 's a issue surprise surprise second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder ! curious enough i 'm a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from it is the transformer more specific two capacitors making this noise that is really poor design low quality components ! ! ! i did not expect this from a brand name like philips this is no different than any no name units out there at half price as a result i am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product this one is definately not worth the money i can not update the stars but this time i would rate it with 0 stars oct 2006 update it stopped reading cds but it reads dvds no problem returned to costco !
this bookstand despite the description is not suitable for heavy books if you put heavy books on this the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off
its made of flimsy plastic and all the parts snap on i 'm afraid to put a heavy book on there because i 'm sure the parts will just snap off
in the ten minutes since i 've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off more importantly it ca n't handle large manuals as advertised the reason i purchased this particular book holder my 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter based on that i estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages if you do n't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on keep an eye on the page retainers these are the parts that fell off and you should be as for me i 'm off to read amazon 's return policy and see if i can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic
i did n't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning the cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned 30 minutes it didn't
when i first started using this i loved it it worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound in fact i bought a second one for my wife then after about two weeks it stopped working it would no longer play in my cassette deck which ejected it as soon as i put it in every time i tried contacting coby 's support on the web but they were unresponsive luckily amazon took it back for a refund note that they no longer sell these directly bet they had too many
when this adapter first arrived i thought it was great the sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm adapter there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area the first day i used it for about 20 minutes total did n't have far to drive and it worked great the second day i had a bit farther to drive after about 30 minutes it quit has n't worked again since i did n't expect it to last forever but less than an hour yes it has a 1 year warranty just send the unit back with a money order 6 to cover the return postage of course then you 're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the
i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i could n't listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn
this adapter would not work at all in my 1996 ford ranger the vehicle 's cassette player kept ejecting it however it did work in a 's 1993 ford ranger it also would not work in a 1993 monte carlo same problem
no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over 6.00 amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !
the is great but if you are playing battlefield 2 and then switch to the zboard you are in a fix the controls are totally different and very hard to get use to if you start with it it might be alright but i think the regular keyboard will be just fine
i bought this dvd player after my sony player died prematurely is it just me or are dvd players supposed to have a longer life this dvd player looks nice and works fine when it is working the player is a bit noisy when reading the discs though but the bottom line is that it just stopped working after only 1 year of use i expected an improvement over my sony player and i am sorely disappointed
good while it lasted pos broke yesterday for no reason wo n't read anything i put in it phillips customer service was no help i have to buy and new dvd player and it wo n't be a phillips
i recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon it is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent however the unit would only work using the s video connector not separate connections the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud
this dvd player does play all types of dvds no matter how you burn it but like other reviews it stopped working after months in my case it was 3 months it just does n't turn on anymore i unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead i do n't watch dvds much so it 's not like i overused it go with another model this one has problems i thought mines would be the exception but i guess not and now i ca n't return it because it 's been over 30 days
the panasonic cd player has a good sound quality but does not automatically change from one cd to the next it requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one cd to another this feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five cd's
lasted three days then stopped playing if you buy this you 're an idiot
bought various capacity lenmar aas and the only consistent thing about them is their inconsistent quality control probably are doa and never will accept a charge despite using various chargers including a maha which has a rejeuvenation and diagnostic function and shows them as nonfunctional another leak and fail prematurely then the rest work ok but just i 've had better success with other brands
i had heard some good things about lenmar nimh batteries about two years ago but had bought another brand this time around with the good price on amazon i gave these lenmar batteries a try i ordered two only 4 out of 20 batteries would accept a charge i tried an energizer charger a lacrosse charger and a lightning pack charger the lacrosse is a charger including diagnostics on batteries voltage displayed for each battery none of these would charge 16 of the batteries even in the 'recovery ' modes available on the ripvan and lacrosse returned the batteries to amazon
i bought this drive a little over one year ago and with 2 years warranty around 8 months period the system can not boot from the drive and the test software provided by wd also proved it 's dead so i mailed it back for a replacement and surprisingly i got back a one with only 3 months warranty literally my warranty plan was cut to 1 year i did n't bother to call them to get a new replacement unfortunately another 2 months after the warranty expires from the one the disk went dead again i would not recommend this model to anyone since within 1 year 2 went bad also i do n't like the way they handle the replacement within warranty period
i have returned one to the factory then they send me another defective too ! ! ! avoid this purchas
i thought that this was an sata hard drive because the label is but is in in fact an eide hard drive so when i bought it i was unable to install it this was probably my fault but no where in the product description does it say that it is eide so i am putting this review up in hopes that no one else mistakenly buys this hard drive
i would not recommend this tv i purchase the tv it has a brilliant quality picture after a couple hours of running four very large segments on the screen went out making it panasonics determined the tv needed to be repaired after a two week wait the technician arrived from a local tv repair center the tech recommended that i take the tv back and exchange it for another he mentioned this is a common issue with panasonic 's and he has a couple in the shop waiting on parts he said i would have to wait several weeks for parts to arrive from panasonic i loaded it up and back it went i exchange it for another brand new tv with in a week same issue in a different area of the screen long story short in the past three months 'm loading up the one tonight to return and try another brand i sense from all of the service techs and panasonic support line this is a common issue nothing i can say i did the tv 's had very little use on battery monster cable ups system coax surge filters and in a well ventilated area based on my experience i would say look
the mount is unable to hold my 17 inch lcd without tilting i have followed the manufactures advise on how to prevent this from happening and it does not work after only 2 months i am now going to have to buy another tv mount do n't waiste your money on this product
it 's a battery charger it charges batteries it 's called 'compact ' because the bottom part accordians out to reveal 4 additional slots for batteries it feels cheaply made and does n't hold the batteries very securely also you have to charge two batteries at a time or sets of 2 and they are inserted in opposite directions so if you 're charging 4 batteries in 2 sets of two they would be i realize that 's how most devices are set up when you insert the batteries but i should n't have to worry about that when inserting into a charger especially since according most warning labels on batteries inserting it in the charger backwards may cause an explosion resulting in injury or death that 's a lot of pressure for someone who just wants more juice for his gameboy ultimately it does what it says though so if you 're looking for a charger to use until you find a real charger go for it
made very cheaply the slider wo n't even hold the batteries in with a good enough contact to charge the batteries once i tried every available slot and they all give a poor contact avoid this charger at all costs
one of the charging bays always indicates that the batteries in the bay are not in working condition i 'm also getting unusual behavior from the other indicators i tried the energizer charger and i 'm having problems with this unit as well see my review for that charger frankly i 'm done wasting my time with energizer chargers now i 've never had these types of problems with other chargers in the past
i do not have enough negative adjectives for this charger echo the other reviewers regarding the sliding contacts they barely work correctly right out of the package consistently getting disconnected at the slightest bump my bet is that after a year of use they do n't work at all and after a disconnect you start the 8 hour cycle all over again which brings me to my second complaint the charger works on a timer something that is not specified on the outside of the package this is the worst way to charge your batteries cooking them with a full charge even if they do n't need it get a charger that senses voltage and your expensive batteries will last a lot longer another thing this charger will charge only an even number of batteries something else that is not specified on the outside of the package it has four separate charging circuits each circuit will work only if it has two identical batteries in it c d and 9 volt can be charged individually again this is a very bad way to charge your batteries especially if the two batteries have different discharge levels and finally the quality is very very poor one charging circuit on my unit did n't work right out of the package it kept showing that it had bad batteries in it even though there were none
i had a need to be able to charge 14 aa batteries i bought two of these since they can each charge 8 at a time if they actually worked they would be great but the quality of these things is comparable to the plastic toys you get in gumball machines and i 'm not exaggerating one of them was broken right out of the package before i had even put batteries in it the compartment for the four additional batteries was separated from the framework so there was no spring tension to hold the batteries in place the other one sort worked for about two hours not long enough to charge up a set of batteries the construction is so flimsy that it will not hold the contacts against the batteries so after a little while half the batteries in the charger were not getting any juice here 's the thing this charger works on a timer it does not measure voltage levels or temperature like a charger after the contacts separated from about half my batteries i had to reseat them which starts the timer over again as a result all of them were overcharged i hope that did not cause permanent damage to them i 'm taking both of these back first thing in the morning i ca n't believe energizer would slap their name on such a worthless piece of junk
first of all the charger takes ! ! ! 8 hours ! ! ! to charge 4 aaa batteries i do not know if you have kids but that is terriable so you push the slider up and down to squeeze the batteries into it 's jaws to charge it then gravity comes into play there is hardly any friction to hold the charger slide in place so after about minutes the slide well of course slides down and then it stops charging now i get to start all over again so in other words check out their 15 minute version yeah that 's right 15 not 8 hours rant started why would they even make an 8 hour sigh never mind back to the all yeah and of course the down put in big letters only 8 hours '' like the other only 15 mins '' live and learn rant over
the first one i had was broken so amazon replaced it quick thanks ! anyhow it does n't take a genius to figure out how to plug it in but they could have given some instructions what does the little knob do anything i ca n't tell any difference how should i point the antenna for best reception people and objects moving about the house can affect the reception channels come an go sometimes for no reason i can get the same quality picture just by hooking up a long coax
this is no better than the old fashion rabbit ears the powered '' portion of this antenna does nothing to boost the signal i found this item to be almost useless since it does not pick up any analog signals very well at all as for the digital signals you will have to adjust the antenna whenever you change the channel if you spent your hard earned money on a hdtv why are you going to buy a junkie antenna
i just got this philips antenna based on the comments i 've seen posted before i knew there was a chance for error but i thought i 'd be on the lucky side the antenna did nothing better for me than the current rabbit required cheap antenna i had before i still need to play a little bit with it before i declare it a disaster so if someone experienced the same and had solved appreciate any suggestion
this is a good fan but it was left on the front porch just sitting there was n't even in a shipping box just the box it is manufactured with and you can also get it for about 35 cheaper at walmart or kmart
i bought this fan mainly due to the positive reviews here however i decided to return the fan for refund on the very first day it arrived because it does n't push as much air as it was claimed by other reviewers here i like its look but a fan must at least achieve its primary objective which is to cool the room i do n't think this fan achieves this objective at all
this warranty is not from amazon or the company you are purchasing from it is instead a contract with a third party you better read it before you spend a hundred bucks the first rule of this agreement is you have to be able to produce the contract the second the receipt next you ca n't have any other warranties in effect then you need to give them three chances to fix your purchase they choose who to send it to you might have to pay the shipping you are not covered for the inconvenience of any of this this is just the first page ! i could n't read anymore because of the poor quality of the file posted here good luck to you and your lawyer and who ever is the world is broken warranties as extras '' i can get all the broken stuff i want at the dump for free what are manufactures thinking when they do n't stand behind their products
maybe you can make this thing work for your particular application but it was pitiful for what i was trying to do first off let me point out one thing if you 're planning on using the little rf wires that hang in front of the infrared recievers on the front of your components bear this in mind when you stick those units in place they block the receiver on the component from being able to receive an infrared signal when they are in place you can only tell your components what you want them to do thru the rf signal that means you ca n't use the existing remote for any of your components which of course means you have to trust that you 'll be able to program every single function of those remotes into this unit i happen to have directtv with tivo as well as a fairly complicated denon unit i can not imagine trying to use this universal remote to control everything that the original remotes did and even if i thought the universal could do it i would n't want to try to relearn all those functions on a new remote i 'm used to the layout of the directtv unit and i 'm not about to start over again that being said you can still use the rf functionality without the hard wired rf transmitters the will also receive the signal from the remote and transmit it wirelessly to your components the problem is you have to position the mrf right in front of the components a few feet away not real convenient unless you want the thing sitting in the middle of your living room if all your components are in a cabinet or something and the mrf is in there with them that may work better but if not you 're out of luck now all that aside the remote will still not transmit to the mrf with any kind of consistency it also will barely transmit thru walls or any other solid objects all i wanted was something to control volume and maybe channels from various locations around the house and on the back porch without rendering my other remotes useless requiring me to place the mrf in a ridiculous location there was no chance of getting what i was after nice idea but no dice
this remote was easy to program but has not worked well for me it will suddenly turn on all the emitters which then blocks all commands for up to hours favorite '' buttons sometimes work other times do not work have tried to get help from universal but they ignore all my emails ca n't recommend this remote
i have to agree with the other reviewer i got my solio in december and it only charged via the sun twice after that even after leaving the solio in the sun for days it wo n't charge it only charges if i plug it in making it useless for me i contacted solio support and they replaced my solio but i 've had the same problem once again solio support has stopped responding to my emails and wo n't tell me what was wrong with my first product they also refuse to refund my money this is a great idea gone wrong stay awa
i bought the complete package wireless router with two cards for my laptops to replace my linksys router that went belly up extremely easy to install and set up however signal strength is all over the place neighbors signals come in strong while your own router shows 1 bar 10 feet away then full strength for a minute followed by no signal at all the utility that installs on your lap top with the network card is poor my new fujitsu never could wake up '' after going into suspend mode with the software same for my older compaq per tech support i first disabled the software then removed it i then downloaded new drivers chance of not having to do a hard powerdown since the entire computer hangs despite both lights being on on the card when i remove the card and use my imbedded antenna with windows the router performs as well any others i have had i will make one more trip to tech support they do answer quickly when you call and see what can be done then it 's all going back harve
my dlink router works fine with one wirelessly connected computer using a netgear adapter but my experience has been like that of others this belkin adapter flakes on and off getting a weak or no signal then full strength back and forth i am going to return it
worked well with matching router for about 3 days then i had to the hardware tech support recommendation i did this a few times before exchanging it same problem the pci card does n't fit right the antennae connectors are too loose also i was having to reboot constantly once removed system is more stable do not purchase this first version of this adapter card i will try the usb version when it comes out
i set up a wireless network with the belkin wireless n router and three computers containing the desktop card the first two worked fine although they 've been lightly used they 're both within 10 feet of the router the third computer unfortunately my main desktop is located about 30 feet away on the same floor down an open hallway it 's hard to know exactly what 's going on because the computer freezes periodically with the desktop card installed when it does n't lock up it has video problems and switches into some default mode all three computers are running windows xp but my computer is the only one to have these problems during the brief intervals when i 'm actually able to bring up the belkin wireless networking utility it either shows the wireless network with minimal signal or the wireless network does n't show up at all i 've uninstalled reinstalled updated drivers and everything i can think of to no avail i also have a laptop running the pc card adapter it works ok but the signal varies between good and poor again in the same room 30 feet away from the router needless to say this has been a discouraging experience and has soured my impression of belkin as well as unfortunately as i 've read reviews of competing products they all seem just as bad i think i 'm going to break down and run a wire to my bedroom and drop the wireless desktop effort for now
i received the wrong speakers i ordered the penguin speakers and got the monkey speakers they were a christmas gift for my niece who collects penguins i the company several times with no response back so i will never order from this company again will take my business elsewhere
these are irresistably cute but they sound terribly tinny and they are unbearable for more than five minutes i regret giving them to someone i love as a gift they are now sitting on his desk as a decoration and he 's still using his old speakers i know you might not be able to stop yourself from buying these do n't expect a pleasant listening experience from these speakers
first off this is not a case it is a pouch with a clear plastic front and draw strings at the top once in the case the controls are not that responsive because they are touchpads also it is such a tight fit that it is hard to get the player in and out of it and i feared scratching the display the fit is so tight that after about a week the stiching holding the clear plastic in place began to come apart and in about another week there was a noticeable hole between the stiching and the clear plastic very low quality for the price i love my creative zen micro photo but hate the fact that accessories are so limited for it
i bought this radio to use while i workout the radio has a cicular dial not digital to change the station while you move the station slips and will change on you you need to hold the radio with your hand to listen definitly not a good radio for excercising
the unit has many positive features however the signal is easily lost indoors and often outdoors as well if it were not such a hassele i would return the unit and continue my hunt for one that is better functioning
i have been using radio headphones for years and i swear the quality and selection gets worse over the years was sony thinking when they developed these things no padding on the ear holes on the back of the head forget it if your wearing any type of eye glasses are so uncomfortable you might just rip them off your head throw 'em on the floor and stomp on all of which i did bottom line uncomfortable analog tuning something i thought went out years ago stupid strap behind the head goofy looking decent reception n't waste your 40 buck
i purchased this card to use in my fujifilm finepix camera for a family vacation i had researched it beforehand to make sure i could use this card in the camera there is an h '' and an m '' card apparently they save things in a different format and the m '' card does not allow for taking videos with this camera i purchased the h '' card and used it mostly to take still photos upon returning home and downloading the photos 505 to my computer i was extremely disappointed to find that once i had copied them to my computer i was unable to view them on my camera anymore and i did not choose to erase them from the card i got an error message on the camera and my only choice was to format the card which meant everything would be erased i was n't happy but i could n't view the photos anyway so i did format it that was one problem the other problem i had was that several of the photos were displayed as question marks on my computer with no image at all others looked fine in the thumbnails but when opened the top half of them was fine but the bottom half was either solid gray or spliced and repeated it was crazy ! these are memories that ca n't be recaptured so it was very upsetting i do not trust the card at all and i will not purchase another one !
the door hinge was broken so door would n't stay on but we decided to try it anyway as we had a surprise coming up in 2 days and needed '' it to keep 30 kids entertained ! borrowed my neighbors little hawaiian ice maker as the little machine ran circles around this big fancy '' one ! ! this one made 1 snow cone to the 64 snow cones the little machine made in 45 minutes ! very disappointed ! emailed company and still waiting for reply after 2 emails and 2 weeks ! thank goodness i had the hawaiian ice for !
this printer is garbage i have used printers since 1989 and this is definitely the worst i owned a few epsons with no problems at all i only upgraded as the technology improved not because any of them were broken or did n't and i think next time i will go back to an epson the hp is a photo '' printer but if you put more than 3 pieces of photo paper in it at a time it will jam and waste your paper and ink it also will not do envelopes without hand feeding it one at a time hand printing would almost be faster ! i have had this printer for over 2 years and the only reason i am writing a review now is because i just tried to put regular paper in it and print a single page word document and it jammed yet again and it was just the last straw do n't waste your money this printer is way too expensive and in my opinion total junk ! my husband bought it because of the memory card capability but as far as i can tell that is the only redeeming quality of this printer at all i will take great pleasure in smashing this one to bits whenever i get around to buying another epson !
if you use either the or satellite modems and do n't have a telephone do not buy tivo ! despite what their website advertises tivo series 2 dvrs can not get programming updates over satellite internet tivo blames hughesnet and tivo customer support is so bad i would put it in the same category with calling is a waste of your time they do not care tivo would n't offer me a refund after advanced technical support promised to extend my warranty until their engineering dept could provided an upcoming patch when the patch failed to fix anything they told me to change my internet provider like i could if i wanted to or that i was simply out of luck they offered to cancel my tivo service but no refund amazing ineptitude when dvrs work they are really cool but buyer beware there must be better dvrs out there i sure hope so
it was n't worth the money that i payed for it is a good radio if you have an external antenna i would play it in the office and could never get a decent signal until i had to pay an extra 30 for an antenna if you are going to pay 300 plus you should get something that works out of the box i could have purchased a lesser know brand and recieved better reception then what i got overall if you want to end up purchasing more products to make your system work to perfection this is the product for you there are plenty of products that do n't cost as much and deliver everthing this did and more
pros nice look great setup on keys multiple keypress works comfortable slim con very long keyboard it misses typed characters about 25 of the time backspace is slow i have about 70 accuracy with this keyboard
i tested the cobra hand held cb on california rt 99 today not so good tuned into truckers ' channel 17 for traffic and heard mostly noise there was very little discernible language so i squelched out the noise and waited and waited i called out for a radio check and got a comeback loud but not clear the speaker in that hand held cb is awful it 's abrasive to listen to it is my opinion that the short 10 inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker this cb radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying i was looking for a portable system for temporary use but the cobra hh road trip cb is pretty poor personally i would n't buy it again
well i now have a handle for my 250 nano the arm snug would be a great idea if they maybe thought about who is probably going to buy this product and what they are going to be doing first off i have to wear this arm band just short of the largest setting on my forearm because even at the largest setting it makes my arm fall asleep from lack of blood flow so unless you are a skinny biker this probably wo n't fit you comfortably the second issue is that there is not a locking mechanism for the strap so when i am working out with my muscles constantly contracting it just changes the strap size and i end up with my nano on my wrist over all this product is great if you are riding a bike or doing anything that does n't cause you to move your arm a lot so if you if you are planning on buying this for relaxing bike ride through the country it is well worth it planning on using your to play angry music to help give you the strength do that one extra rep do n't bother bullet proof shield though is a must since those little screens get scratched so easily
it probably would hold the ipod pretty well but i returned it before giving it a fair trial in that aspect for the price you do n't get a whole lot of protection there 's nothing to secure the top and the ipod has to be completely removed from the carrying case in order to use the click wheel and view the screen
i have had a major problem with this dock which is that i ca n't get it to work with any firewire cable except the one supplied with it i 've tried several cables that i 've tested and i know for certain work but none will work i can get power the blue light goes on but i ca n't get the ipod 60 gig gen photo to show up in the itunes window or in the mac finder i have n't tried it with windows this problem is perplexing because i do n't see any difference physically in the 6 pin firewire cable supplied with this dock and the others that i have tried i 've emailed maxell but they have yet to give me an answer to this problem after one week there may be a simple answer but i do n't have time to make this dock work right i need to use my ipod so i 'm returning it in short a word of warning if you need to connect this dock via firewire and need a cable longer than the two foot one supplied with it you may be out of luck
this product 's description is obviously lying when it says that there 's no other equipment needed i plugged it in just like the instructions said and i got a horribly quiet signal looking on their website it says that you need to buy a preamp for it to be used as i said i 'm extremely disappointed and would not reccomend this product to anybody
i returned this product as it does not accommodate the outer title insert only the inner page product recommended for customers who do not wish to keep the outer slipcase cover page
my daughter really loved getting this item for christmas unfortunately the cd player is not reliable it freezes sometimes for several hours unfreezes unexpectedly especially great in the middle of the night skips repeatedly or just plain refuses to start at all the only thing that works well is the radio we already have a radio so the purchase was a big waste of money terribly disappointing i strongly recommend that potential buyers look elsewhere
my daughter got this for christmas and it stopped working three weeks later ! for the price i expected it to work more than 3 weeks plus i have a very disappointed 6 year old who does n't have a cd player anymore
died after 6 months could not configure would only reset to default config which gave no security worthless support was bad ! ! never again for netgear products !
i bought this product to use it as a bridging client in an existing belkin wireless network and it failed to pass any data even though it showed connected to the belkin access point according to the netgear docs this access point can operate as a access point or as a bridging client but what the fail to tell you is that it bridges only in a netgear environment after spending 20 mins on the phone with netgear they told me i needed to buy a different model which is non or more netgear access points how can a company like this be selling proprietary hardware in todays day and age leon mccall
in an attempt to increase the range on my netgear mr 314 router i got this access point but i could not get it to function i was told i needed two of them so i got a second one and i still could not make it work i gave up and replace my router with a rangemax wpn 824 and it is terrific gives me all the range i could want letting me send and receive at 24 mbs where the mr 314 would not reach at all
i have to reboot this at least twice per day netgear refuses to acknowledge that their access point sucks
cons defect the backlight does not work shortcoming has palm os 3.1 an early version for handspring visors neutral expedited shipping time 5 days pros price ps vendor customer support contacted me and provided a replacement unit with a working backlight free of additional charge SMILE
i bought a palm back in april 2005 for 299.00 and it has proven to be money down the drain i experienced the screen freezing up on me which required a hard reset procedure thereby resulting in a loss of all information i sent it back for repair around august 2005. they returned it supposedly repaired and i experienced the same problems with it after this first repair around may 2006 it was sent back for another repair and i am again experiencing the same problem the previous two repairs '' were done at no cost to me the company now says that they will repair it at a cost to me because it is out of warranty the company notwithstanding the language of its warranty should in my opinion stand behind its product the product has proven to be unreliable and a headache be forewarned i rated this product with one star because there was no lower alternative
i purchased this item last august it failed 6 months after purchase it has one year warranty i returned it to the manufacturer with all the details included the sevice order number on the box it was later returned to me i am very disappointed now i have a product that does n't work
if you are one of those types who can become frustrated after fiddling with a portable player for an hour just to get 9 songs transferred to it you 'd better pass this baby by i often wonder if the people that make these things ever do any real testing with real people to see how functional their devices really are the player itself played music fine the real problem comes when you try to add or remove music from the time i plugged it into my xppro machine to the time i unplugged it with 9 songs on it 60 minutes had elapsed everytime you plug it into your machine you have to reinstall the driver so you 'd better have a special folder setup to hold that 'll be needing it the music manager is prone to lockups get ready to see a lot of not responding '' shutdowns and launching task manager to try and shut down the frozen '' music manager you will find this will not shut it down though you will have to unplug the usb cable from your computer to get it to shut down but do not try and deactivate the usb device like you are supposed to before unplugging any usb device the os will not let you you will get a program is accessing this device '' message that program is your not responding '' music manager when you add a song it puts the song where it wants to you 'd think a song that begins with a '' would come after the song that begins with b '' on the device but that 's not the way it works and there is no way to order the songs after you add them and they go in the wrong order you try and drag it up or down and it locks up and do n't try renaming to get them to order that way because they will not rename properly the music manager is a poor design as far as the device itself you 'd think that in our high tech age they could come up with a fool proof connector think again you 'll need a magnifying glass to connect the usb cable to the device because it can go in the wrong way and this is not the type of device you want for jogging or working out they supply this long necklace for it to dangle from but you start running down the street with this device hanging off your neck whipping back and forth and you 'll be knocking out fellow joggers left and right ! you 'd think they could also design a pair of ear phones that actually fit in your ear ! just slow walking with this device shoved in my pocket i was frequently putting the ear bobs back in my ear and do n't even ask me what it was like to replace the battery on this power hungry gadget i guess my 8 certifications in it just do n't qualify me to be skillful enough to use such a high tech device perhaps you will be more fortunate but if you want my advice pass iriver products by the hardware may work but you need software to run it and unless you like the message not responding '' try another product
first one did n't work got a replacement both easy to put music on the device but the music will not play very clugy button setup and even the neighborhood tekky kid could n't get the songs downloaded to play do n't buy this item !
when i first got the player it was great it worked fine and i was very pleased with its battery life but then only 3 weeks after i bought the product it broke and unfortunately for me i threw away the box and everything that came with it once i thought it was working satisfactorily oh well all i have to say is if given the chance i would not have bought the product in the first place and regret doing so now
the unit would n't support drm so any songs downloaded from the internet were not usable on the player once we got some cd 's burned and songs copied on it crashed and was never recoverable the voice recording feature also never worked like it said it would
i purchased this about 9 months ago i had problems with the installation and was on with tech support for the better part of an hour because my printer is a bit older and not plug and play ready a lot of the functions had to be disabled the product worked for about 6 months but is now not fuctioning i am being asked to return it for a replacement but i am finding they do not support this model any longer with the price of these days i might as well replace my fax and buy one with a usb and a new wireless server to boot
ordered this device to add a wireless network printer connection after 1 hour with customer service i was told that the item was defective linkys would replace it unless i wanted to use it as a wired device and took my credit card number as for the additional device in the event that i did not return the defective one four weeks later having received nothing from the company i was charged for an additional unit i called the company to contest the charges linksys told me that they were out of stock and charged me because they had not received the return unit ! i have all linksys equipment router switches etc and have n't had too many issues but i am not a fan of this company since this incident i should have returned the printserver to amazon first
i bought this product with great hopes for making my house wireless but it never worked after i made sure that i followed the directions properly i called customer service and spent 2 hours on the phone trying to fix the problem eventually they told me to mail it in for an exchange that was 3 months ago i called a month ago and they told me the product was on backorder and that they could not give me an estimate of when it would be available
this thing sucks as does their telephone support was told that it did n't support using 2 computers it seems it should am still on hold while i write this
i have been on the phone and on the internet with linksys support suince i received this ite the install discs did not work the support personnel can not help after an hour on the phone stumped you are cut off and have to start over to linksys are ignored i am not computer illeterate but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit mine is still sitting here like a lump i will return it to amazon and ask for costs of shipping as this is a useless product
i ca n't believe amazon and kensington are still selling this product i just bought mine last week and when it would n't register i got this email back from kensington tech support dear john thank you for contacting kensington technical support its unfortunate that you are facing this issue i suspect that there might be some issue with our database at this point of time there is no resolution i would suggest you to go for refund to initiate the refund process kindly fax us the purchase receipt to 6502492323 include ticket and attention vishal '' in your fax this will enable us to process refund for you i sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused regards vishal kensington technical suppor
read my initial review below which was on july 27. on august 11 kensington told me that they do not know when the password registration process will be working and they strongly urged me to send the product back for a refund on july 27 i wrote this should be a great item at a great price and as far as i can tell it works fine kensington has some serious technical problems however the encryption installs and becomes before you can register your usb key and password registration is essential in case you lose the key or forget your password this is a big problem because as of july 26 2006 kensington 's registration utility was down and not expected to be working until days current estimate worse the message i got when attempting to register my key the first two days was authentication failed '' which told me nothing even worse their overseas technical support person did not know about the problem so he also thought i had a defective key and we wasted a lot of time discussing replacement and timing i 'm about to leave on a trip and really wanted this protection for the trip when i finally realized that i would not receive a new key before i left i asked whether i should uninstall the product or whether i could register the key verbally in case the key was lost on the trip i figured the answer was no but i was getting desperate he went away for a long time then he reported that he would have to call me back that took 40 minutes and finally he reported that probably my key was fine it 's the registration that was offline and no there is no other way to register that 's part of the security so the encryption is in place the laptop boots and runs fine but i have two days to decide whether to risk taking my laptop and losing the physical key which means i would have to wipe my hard drive or risk uninstalling the encryption and having the laptop stolen in which case i still lose all my data and sensitive data is exposed the laptop will be at risk in hotel rooms and the key will be at risk on my person as i will be swimming and snorkeling kensington claims the thing is waterproof maybe i 'll just buy one of those little waterproof capsules and keep it around my neck
it looks as tough as a tank but it is n't once it crashed eveyone told me it 's a very delicate piece of equipment i did not carry mine around for one it is too heavy i also only fired it up when i did my monthly backups so i did n't have it running all the time so it should n't have over heated as others have mentioned but after less than 11 months the computer stopped recognizing it hums but never gets anywhere i changed the ports bought new cables all to no avail as it happens my computer had failed and i was relying on the lacie back up drive to retrieve my files what a shock when i could n't get to them tried other computers both macs and pcs and still no sightings of the lacie drive on the desktop even though still under warranty i got no help from the lacie help desk their suggestions to use a data recovery application is unhelpful since i could n't see the drive to select it they do n't even give you a toll free number to call they also expect you to pay to ship the heavy thing to them even under warranty they give no help to retrieve data if you allow anyone to open the case it voids the warranty but they wo n't send you the hard drive separately even if you send them the item intact and it turns out that it 's something else head aches head aches it worked it would be great but it 's not the drive that is important it is the data and if lacie has n't figured out a way to help clients when their products fail they should n't be in this business buyer beware ! i would n't buy another lacie ever again also learned my lesson two copies are still not enough especially if one of them is lacie
once the software developers have the iriver interface with the media player 11 it may well be an excellent device until such time what you have is an fm player when you try to play anything you have you will find yourself viewing the error message ' to play this track you must sync your device to your pc ' it 's quite disappointing so much promise my rating not ready for prime time
i bought this device because i was excited at the prospect of downloading music from my rhapsody subscription using the microsoft plays for sure '' digital rights management drm framework that comes with this device there could not be a more ironic name for this drm my experience is that the does anything but plays for sure '' when it comes to playing my subscription music from rhapsody one thing that is annoying but i suppose an actual feature of the drm is that it locks up the music so that you ca n't play it after a certain and mysterious number of days very frustrating if you are planning on taking it on a trip and wo n't be able to sync to your computer for long periods of time you get a to play this track you must sync your device to your pc '' error message here 's the part that is unforgivable though there have been numerous times like today when i sync the device and still get these messages on some music files and not others its completely random it 's not a question of a particular song being protected or not i 've had songs that play fine on one sync and not on another i 'm a pretty forgiving customer generally speaking i hardly ever write these reviews but when this happened again today i went to the iriver website to see if they had any remedies and after digging around for a hour or so and not finding a good option for connecting with a real person i decided it was time to post this warning to other potential buyers it 's a pretty device and is cool on many measures but do not buy this product if you are hoping to use it with the subscription features on the rhapsody music service you will be more frustrated than it is worth i do n't know if there are similar problems with other music services cool idea bad execution
i bought with the intent on organizing my dvd collection they look great on a shelf but once you load 64 dvds into the cases they have a very hard time staying shut i ended up having to put an elastic around the top and bottom in order for it to stay closed which kinda defeated the whole purpose of buying them in the first place i would stick to a case that zips around so you do n't have this problem
the quality of sound and manufacture of this unit is unacceptable it was made in china although it has an attractive design the outside is made from the same inexpensive plastic that my 29 panasonic dvr is made from the recorder has two modes sp and ep sp is the highest quality but playback still sounds cheap at the highest quality there also are two microphone settings dictation and conference in dictation mode the microphone can only pick up what is said within about 12 18 inches the quality is audible but not great conference mode only works when one person is speaking in a completely quiet room something that is not realistic with people shuffling about any background noise will render the recording inaudible even in a quiet room the quality is muffled and unacceptable the high price for this unit definitely is not indicative of its quality which appears to be low i have other less expensive units that are better built and have a higher audio quality i do not understand the other reviews other than to believe someone with less experience using dvrs would have a different expectation perhaps it works better with an external microphone or when used solely in a closed environment such as a quiet closed interrogation room which i believe defeats the purpose of a small unit meant to be carried around a 1 mb xd card gives 168 hours in sp mode or 358 hours in ep which would be great if the product worked similar to other brands the controls are not intuitive but can be learned easily and are not a drawback
i am very disapointed with this product the mouse reacts on every click i am not alone who has this problem so the only thing i can recommend to new customers dont buy it ! it is almost unusable and after problems with creative sb audigy i am really not interested in any creative product in the future
first of all the mouse pointer does not move cleanly its jumpy the keyboard stopped functioning within a week after i bought it but since creative offered a rebate it had to be mailed within 2 weeks i had already sent the original upc hence i could n't return the item to amazon i exchanged emails with the customer service back and forth a few times regarding this and finally they agreed to fix my keyboard so i had to ship i paid for the shipping it to the rma center at the rma center they had the keyboard for 13 working days and it was not even tested after i emailed them about this they finally sent me a replacement keyboard but without the rf receiver ! ! i had to email them again and they shipped me the receiver so finally got the keyboard working after about 45 days ! ! on the whole i am totally disappointed with the very poor quality product from creative and the poor customer service provided by creative this has forced me to refrain from buying any creative product in the future
the mouse worked great but the keyboard was very erratic after my efforts to make it work failed i called customer service they do not have a toll free number but they handle the call as if they have one there are long lists of menus to navigate through and they put you on hold forever when someone answered the phone i described the problem and he immediately said that the keyboard appeared defective and i should exchange it the conversation lasted only 30 secs moreover they only work from to 7 pm so i had to come homw from work to make this call the customer service person was nice but the whole setup is very poor and reflects badly on the company if the person in charge of customer service at this firm reads this then please realize that your efforts to save money by not having toll free numbers and limited working hours will be frustrating to most customers who have come to expect a better service with the nature of products you make a person has to be with the product when they troubleshoot and for working people that means having to go home during working hours on the whole the wireless mouse was just awesome i have n't worked with a functional version of their wireless keyboard yet
this product simply does not work i purchased this item about a month ago to back up my software on my old pc because i was about to buy a new pc after backing up all my photos music files extra using the trusted method it seemed as though the files loaded successfully on the hard drive i restarted my old computer and verified that the files were on the drive everything seemed i then went to my new computer to upload the files but it said that the files did n't exist it was panic time because i had already reformatted my old compuer so i just lost all my files i went to wd support and i was told to only back my files up using their software called retrospect if i used drag and drop then who knows what will happen i was enraged external hard drives are supposed to be simple like portable usb drives but wd has made a simple process more difficult that it needs to be i will never recommend or buy a western digital product again
first of all the product does not totally inhibit the ability of someone sitting next to you on an airplane seeing your screen it just creates a more dark shadow of what 's on your screen second if your screen did not have a glare before it will now with this product third there is a distracting notch at the top of the filter so you have this annoying thumb sized area and the filter does not cover do not waste you money on this privacy filter
it does n't really work i mean unless you 're in a call center lined side by side but if you 're in an office setting nope does n't work i wanted to use this so people passing by would n't really see my screen there are screens that can do this but not this one ! while the filter is nice on the eyes and the way it places on the screen beats those big clunky guys that hang on the monitor plus it 's subtle i 'd trade all this for it actually working
the mic 's quality is okay but i tried using it with my iriver and my computer and i get that really annoying white noise in the background all the time it 's really loud before you buy it check out some on the internet if you are interested in high quality
i bought this label maker for my nephew as a christmas present the only labels available then were white now i ca n't get any labels there goes a great gift that will only last as long as the refill
but not if you are listening classical and have more than below average requirements regarding sound reproduction quality there is a hiss '' present all the time cracking noises nonlinear distortion echo and other artifacts i tried drivers getting new drivers all with no effect if you want quality get external sound device from xite
some of you guys must have some crummy soundcards installed on your machines if this widget sounds better than your stock unit in theory of course the aa micro should be the business it 's a dedicated or unit as far as i can tell but the transients are terribly produced no solid sound stage i 'm also hearing added noise and i 'm not expecting audiophile quality either ! i 'm using a mid range pair of sennheisers on my ibm thinkpad seriously the installed sound card is quieter and does a far better job i tried a variety of apps musicmatch mediaplayer audition with the same results the noise is not constant so must be in the conversion stages instead of interference wanted to love this but it 's rubbish
like most device drivers the turtle beach specific driver needs to be installed with administrative rights nothing unusual however when a non administrator logs on as is good security practice the driver says is needs to be reinstalled which is not possible without administrator rights not usable for me as i do n't use the administrator account except for special purposes a security best practice '' without the turtle beach specific driver it works as a generic usb sound card with the default microsoft driver no reinstallation required ! no special sound effects then so not worth the extra price premium over a generic usb sound card too bad the poor software implementation ruined a good piece of hardware as when it works it sounds great
unit had bad logic board and died after about 1 week of use next one the power supply died within 1 month unit had bad paper feeder unit same bad paper feeder problems but couple weeks after warranty ended and hp would not replace despite same problem they fixed '' earlier drivers are junk and buggy in contrast we have a canon unit over a year with zero problems and a canon printer about years with no problems stay away from this hp in fact all hp units as it will be a pain dealing with the repair issues my son also had a hp that was replaced 3 times in 4 months he finally ended up selling the replacement unit he received and buying a canon all in all 7 replacement units within 1 year between the 2 hp units in our home junk ! junk ! junk
i purchased this expensive all in one exactly 2 months after warranty while replacing black ink cartridge the plastic piece that holds the metal clip in place broke off and is not repairable or replaceable buyer beware ! hp printers are not same quality as they used to be this is very expensive for a disposable product ! ! ! !
i 'm almost the same as another consumer i loved the printer for home office use however upon changing out a color cartridge last night it just broke hp cusotmer service chat is absolutely worthless they refused to go through that is on their own website but rather just tired to sell me a new printer with absolutely no credit the support is terrible and i do n't like disposable 300 printers i will think long and hard before buying another hp product i 'm doing my homework this time
first the print quality is very good when it does work it seems to work very well i was pleased with the print quality and features and the print speed is excellent but the real problem is the extremely unstable software more than half the time i could not start a scanning operation without it failing and when it fails it really fails and the only way to get it back working again is to pull the plug on the printer that 's right the power button wo n't turn off the printer power when this happens and restart the computer which was the target of the scan output since i normally do a fair amount of scanning this meant most days having to reboot both printer and computer just to do a simple scanning job the printing software was also iffy although not nearly the problem as was the scanner software probably 10 of the time a print job would not complete the hp image software which came with the printer was a very useful and tool which i would recommend for the most part hp chose however to ignore all the normal windows software conventions like having a file and edit menu at the top of the screen so you are always having to hunt around for what you want to do bottom line i hate playing the lottery '' wondering whether my print or scan job will actually work each time i try to print or scan something this is not a finished product and i strongly recommend buying something else
impossible to be acceptably used to scan documents to a if you scan from adobe acrobat standard you can not stop the hp driver from cutting out parts of the image it considers negligible b if you scan from adobe acrobat standard all colors will be grey c if you scan from hp director files will be 4 times the normal size 3 mb file with adobe acrobat standard 12 mb with hp director no way to downsize it
this printer was very easy to set up on our home network it prints both color and bs fast copies and scans well over the network and handles photos fairly well unfortunately it only lasted 19 months the simple act of replacing the black ink cartridge broke something within the cartridge holder i thought it was a spring as its plastic mount was broken off nothing that a dab of gorilla glue could n't handle but that did n't do the trick and i ca n't see what else is wrong we have a bunch of these printers at work and two of them have stop working as well trying to get hp support is very frustrating hp 's chat is useless these are clearly made to be disposible when they break hp does n't support its products and these printers are not of the same quality as the old hp laserjets shame because the network printer is a great idea and this printer otherwise would be a great printer so i 'm now searching for a networked printer to replace this one
my dell photo 964 and this server were n't compatible i think it is my printer 's problem not the server's
i thought this was something i would use and enjoy after just a few uses i ca n't be bothered with it most of the words i tried to looked up were not there it may be of use to a gradeschooler but anyone with a higher reading level would get nothing but a bookmark and i would rather use a paperclip
this was a very disappointing product i think it is a great idea and bought 3 of them to give as christmas presents i 'm returning 2 because it is useless the dictionary is way too limited during my first day of use i looked up seven words and three were not in the dictionary all three are readily available in my regular dictionary all of the resources spent on games address book etc would have been better spent on improving the dictionary
i really enjoy the idea of this item as it will definitely save some careless people headaches however i have two macbooks in my home and have gone through six of these adaptors in eight months which breaks down to 1.33 a month ! the cords consistently separate at the connecter i suppose if your laptop remained on a desk and you did n't travel a lot it 'd last longer they need to reinforce the wire where the cord and the adaptor tip meet i would not buy one of these as an extra one because it is highly probable you 'll have an issue and if you buy them over the counter you only get a 14 day return policy at least with the macbook purchase it covers you from years depending on if you bought applecare
the outgoing message that i tried to record sounded terrible so i have to use the default outgoing message to delete a message you hit the button not very intuitive as sometimes it just shuts the machine off if your timing is not right i 've had it for over a year it works fine but i 'm looking to replace it for something of better quality that 's easier to use
this pci post card is barely acceptable i bought this unit because time was very short for me i needed to test a dead computer as quickly as possible and amazon could get this to me quickly the card installs in the pci slot so that the lcd unit mounted on it is upside down and you have to tilt the system unit backwards hunker yourself down and generally experience discomfort in order to view the code coming on the card for the money one pays it would be better to include a cable with an lcd display on the end which plugs into the card the worst point about this post card is the horrible misspelled incomplete documentation you might as well make sure you have several websites handy which list post codes and explains their meaning and what action if any you should take the documentation was written by an asian person who learned english as a second language and learned it poorly at that the vendor ought to hire a qualified technical writer fluent in english to write the manual by this i mean a technical writer who natively speaks reads and writes english poorly done documentation should be unacceptable for technical equipment the manual does n't explain what a post code of 00 means it does not list what corrective actions might be appropriate for a given code i had to google search for such information that might be the best thing to do with this type of hardware i do n't know i just feel that if a manual is included with the hardware it should be well written and decently comprehensive in summary the biggest reason for not buying this card is the miserable documentation also this card should have an lcd attached to a cable which can plug into the card body making it easy to read the post codes this should come standard for the price
palms have nice user interfaces this is my second palm pda the screen is excellent and it is thin and light the software works well and synchronizes without problems to windows xp home and xp professional unfortunately after two years the switch has failed this requires me to use one of the hot '' buttons to turn it on this allows me to continue to use this device but it is annoying and inconvenient these are all about convenience right my first palm device an also had its switch fail after two years before its main board failed palm needs to understand that i have other things to do with my money than to spend 200 every two years on a pda because they did n't make the switch robust enough one should want to buy a new pda because of new features and design not because of mechanical failure this device has been well taken care of and has not been abused my wife 's treo had its speaker fail after 45 days and occasionally the phone portion requires a reset although i have not had any problems with palm software my it consultant tells me that the palm software does not synchronize well with the windows tablet operating system although i would have liked to stay with the palm os because of the mechanical failures of my two palms and the treo my next pda will probably be from hp
i got a whole six months use out of this unit before the battery would no longer charge this is apparently very common for these units check out some of the forums around relating in particular to the battery problems i checked with palmone and it will cost 120.00 to replace the battery plus shipping they will only replace at palm what is the point in buying a 200.00 unit if you have to spend another 120 after six months you are better off buying a zire
i started adding files to this card to use in my phone but it has never shown more than 1 gb capacity even though it is printed 2.0 gb on the face i have contacted sandisk just earlier tonight to find out what is up with this card so far i am more confused than pleased
i 've owned this for a year and am looking for a new keyboard i have continual connection problems with mouse and keyboard and continually have to reset low battery warnings appear every day this keyboard was not cheap and i thought microsoft could do better but i ca n't afford to waste my time trying to type a sentence
this was a bad purchase mouse touch is very hard to control tried adjusting a number of times but to no avail also the screen says mouse battery is weak and opening programs by clicking does n't work at times so i 've changed the battery and moved the pickup unit closer to the mouse but i still get the same problems
i am very unhappy with this combo and will return it the wireless connection is terrible and the keys on the keyboard stick brand new i like my logitech optical mouse much better
i bought this as a replacement for a slightly older microsoft wireless keyboard that was stolen the other used bluetooth and was great this one uses a different system with a long cord reciever unit as opposed to a small plug in usb my main complaint is that it frequently drops a letter or number here and there this would not be a big problem if you are writing a letter to your aunt margie but if you are entering financial data it is a very big deal varying the distance from the reciever to the board makes no difference ditto with fresh batteries even duracells there are plenty of other good board out there so do not waste your time on this one
the wireless connection on this mouse and keyboard is absolutely horrible with fresh batteries changed several times and having the pod close or far from the keyboard or mouse does n't make any difference the mouse is jittery and jumping right and left because of bad connection even resetting it does n't work the keyboard has the same problems with a message popping up on the screen continually avoid this product
well i read the reviews for this mouse and since it had mostly 5 star raitings i decided to buy it i just recieved it today and already it has given me problems the mouse curser either clicked on something or while being moved moves on it 's own around the screen and sometimes dissapears i 'm most likely going to return it
i bought two of the 30 packs of verbatim lightscribe cdrs from best buy i would be very optimistic in saying that 1 out of 3 actually worked oh the music burns on to them no problem but when i flip them over to do the lightscribe label it tells me the media is not recognized as lightscribe this happens no matter what program i use ! and what sucks even worse is that with the coating on the cd it 's almost impossible to write on so you end up with an cd anyways oh well back to the hp discs
these discs are not able to accept the lightscribe labelling of the new lacie porsche write
i tried the product in three different computers and each time received an error power limit has been exceeded on the usb port '' i went to the western digital site which offered two solutions 1 buy an extra cable which powers the hard drive by using two usb ports or 2 simply ignore the error they claimed the hard drive would still work the extra cable is hard to find it was out of stock on western digital 's site regardless i located a cable but still got the same error message so i moved on to the next solution ignore the error that did not work either the computers automatically disabled the port not to mention the hard drive was obviously dead as a door nail i did further research and found that this is a common problem in many cases the product was found to be defective someone suggested using a powered usb hub i tried that too hard drive still dead and same error so i returned it long story short this is a common problem sometimes it can be corrected with an extra cable sometimes it is just a defective product you are taking your chances with this product
the wd passport hard drive requires a little over of power at spin up '' says the wd troubleshooting website why no mention of that here or on its product page my usb drive provides so i need another cable extra cost and extra delay what cheek i advise you to check what power your usb port provides before ordering this
i plugged it into my mac mini and it shut down all usb ports on the machine and the monitor after some fiddling found it was drawing too much power and the mini shut down the entire usb bus i 've seen an amazon review saying the version work on someone 's mini so maybe it 's just the one or maybe it 's my dec mini
i was using this unit to hold cd cases which i admit can be heavy but if you say your product can hold 280 cds it should be able to hold 280 cds as a matter of fact well before i reached that point the weight of the cds caused the sides to bow outward causing the adjustable '' shelves to fall very disappointed with this product
dvds stored on this shelf would get seasick the whole thing wobbles like crazy wood is okay but materials that hold the wood together are terrible do n't buy even for the low price
this letter is a summary of my experience with planon for the past 6 months it all began innocent enough i saw an article about the docupen and saw immediate possibilities for potential use over the summer of 2006 i was going to order the docupen 800 pro for i was going to have great use in my teaching environment with worcester state college as well as becker college both located in worcester massachusetts from a technological perspective i was intrigued so began my research of trying to learn more of the product i searched the web for reviews personal opinions etc and well all in all things seemed positive minus the software interface and the fact the system shuts off after every one page scan anyway in early august i decided to order a docupen even though on the website it said orders were taking weeks to fill i called sales and was told that do to manufacturing delays it was going to be closure to 4 weeks for fulfillment or i could just call back in september when the docupens are to be in i placed my order on september 15 2006 for a docupen pro standard color 349.00 order number xxxx now all i had to do was wait two weeks went by and no word from planon in regards to the status from my order now school has been in session for a week now but that is when i called i am told that the shipment did n't arrive do to manufacturing difficulties at this point i am willing to believe customer service two more weeks go by and still not response from customer service about the status of my shipment i attempt to call the and keep getting the answering service i tried only to find out that an order that was suppose to take weeks is now going to take weeks the kind lady from customer service offered me a carrying case for the scanner when it arrives i really did n't care about any carrying case i just wanted up front honesty about where the heck my scanner was and when was it going to be delivered 3 months go by and finally the docupen scanner arrives was it worth the wait no ! in total the delivery time took over 3 months in such time i was able to find another product that better met my needs for the purpose of scanning documents even though i had decided to purchase another product i was still looking forward to using my planon docupen all i have to say is that i was sorely disappointed at the scan quality the poor software options and overall experience for planon so with no hesitation i requested to return my docupen under the money back guarantee was that to be the end of my frustrations with planon no ! here is a time line of various correspondences in the attempts to get an rma and refund issued december 4 2006 initial request for an rma december 4 2006 i receive standard rma procedure december 4 2006 all required questions from rma questionnaire have been answered and emailed back december 11 2006 receive rma sheet december 12 2006 send back docupen according to planon specifications with tracking and signature confirmation emailed rma department to inform of status december 14 2006 receive email from rma rep saying that they will be looking out for the package december 18 2006 receive email verification from post office of signature confirmation january 8 2007 i email rma rep to find out status january 14 2007 i email rma rep again to find out status january 18 2007 i receive an email from the rma rep informing me that the package had indeed arrived and that the credit would be issued in 5 days january 25 2007 i still have not received any verification or communication that my credit is being processed january 29 2007 i call planon and have the following conversations called planon today i spoke with a harmony from customer service i was told that april mcknight is the credit manager apparently the credit manager has been out of the office for the past week though that does n't explain the email from nick on explain that the credit will be issued in 5 days here over two weeks after that email apparently the credit is still sitting on april 's desk i was told by harmony that it will be taken care of this week '' so i have been more than patient in regards to waiting for reply and follow up from anyone from planon every time i contacted someone about the request for an rma i was the one that had to follow up 4 times before receiving a reply to my request i have now emailed three times in regards to receipt of my returned docupen needless to say i find the product not worth the time or the money the company has miserable customer service but i should have been aware of this when i first placed my order and was told it would take 2 weeks and it arrived 3 months later and the product was a piece of junk
we bought this scanner for scanning documents while traveling and the resolution and capacity are not as advertised the resolution and quality of the scanned image is grainy and not clear at all the scanner also holds a lot fewer pages than advertised
unfortunately this was a very poor functioning item the idea is great but the technology is simply not here yet it did not scan properly no matter what i did i do not recommend this item as i had to ship it back fortunately i purchased it directly from amazon and was only out of the shipping if you are going to try this item i highly recommend the same
the docupen holds at a maximum 10 pages when i called customer service about this i was told that the unit 's capacity was being exceeded because i was scanning high resolution images '' photos no pictures no i was scanning printed pages from books apparently the docupen can only hold around 10 pages of normal text the 50 page limit described in their advertising apparently refers to pages with a sentence or 2 on them rather than actual pages in books or journals very odd considering it 's touted as a tool for students a complete waste of time and money i returned it and now i 'm back to using the photocopier do n't bother with this one it 's not at all what they claim
this is a gadget with more promise than delivery it was a retirement gift to me and i 'm sure glad that not a penny from my pocket went toward the purchase difficult to operate and the end product is not worth the trouble you have been warned
the materials appear to be of a good quality not that i 'd know the software that comes with it to print has n't been updated in years and its the original release sure enough after spending days trying to get it to work at all it was clear the entire purchase was a waste of money i checked the company 's website about the software and they have no updates in three years no way of getting support i expect programs to have bugs that 's normal the problem is this company apparently has no intention of either taking customer support requests and has n't released even a bug patch in years so the chances of it working on a modern computer with a modern printer is increasingly slim
these labels are of good quality and the print on them is but the program that comes with the package is horrible it is antiquated inflexible and downright poorly designed you have to view the page sideways there is no align feature the list goes on and on if you want to use these inserts be prepared to use a program like power point and spend the time to measure the paper to align it on the page yourself the software that comes with this package sure isnt going to do the job right
i had this unit for about 6 months one day smelled somthing getting hot reached behind the computer a touched the power supply and it was hot enough to blister my finger i do n't think i need any more of these
i purchased a ultra power supply 6 months ago for it design and warranty the fan quit running and burned up the power supply i ultra and there reply was ultra products wrote thanks for your email in order to start your exchange process please reply to this email with your full name shipping and billing addresses phone number and a scanned copy of your invoice in either jpg or pdf format once we have received that information you will receive an ultra ticket number at which time you can call us at to proceed with rma replacement please note that we require a major credit card issued in the us for warranty replacement thank you for choosing ultra products the only way i can get my power supply replaced is to allow them to charge 99.00 to my credit card which they said they would reimbursed in full upon reciept of the defective item at there warehouse and determined to be defectived they would not answer how long it would take for the refund ! ! needless to say i would not recommended purchasing ultra products
i bought this case to keep my daughters new first act acoustic guitar safe from harm that she got for christmas i made the assumption that the company would only make something that worked well for children since that is what they tailor to when i received the i was very dissappointed the case is a case that basically folds in half whether the guitar is in the case or not it is too large for my daughter 's guitar and i ca n't see how the case could possibly keep a guitar from harm unless a parent were to hang the case up in a closet out of the way of the world children just need a case for guitars a company who makes guitars for children should know this and make something for this purpose
there were several disappointments with this product first it shipped without a transformer assuming one would use it only with batteries its controls are cumbersome sound is ok
i bought it because it said that it comes with ac adaptor but you know what the ac power adaptor is not supplied with usa cannadian models i felt like been cheated at least they should have let me know that i am getting maybe next time i should check with the stores first before i get anything
i got this for plugged it in and the sound was great then i attached my ipod and the volume stopped working i disconnected it and then unpluged the system now when i plug it in it emits a high pitched sqeaking and will not turn on
this unit sounds and the aspect is a nice difference however none of the inserts that come with it fit the new '' ipod nano i 'm still waiting to hear from homedics about getting an insert that
i purchased this product but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away the first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder ! the effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it 's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress the solder breaks you then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection i replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter the second problem is that when i unplugged the power adapter from the wall it would cause my laptop ibm to emergency power off unplugged at the laptop plug was fine i understand this to be an issue between the power system and a surge issue in the adapter i replaced this with a kensington 33197 adapter it looks almost like the same product same oem except they have stronger power tips it also did n't have the issue i loved the form factor but the product just did n't work
i bought this cahrger and i was never able to use it ! ! ! i even bought the correct tip for my laptop but i ca n't get it to work i have no one to talk to at targus ! ! ! save your money stay away
i bought this monitor in april 2006. for six months it was great then it stopped working it 's under warranty so i am hoping to get it fixed at apple 's expense but i ask you what kind of quality control does apple use and what can i expect after the warranty runs out next april i am deeply disappointed i have been using apple computers for 22 years this was the first time i bought an apple monitor it is also the last time
this product works ok as basic gigabit switch it looks very nice for home office does not get hot however i bought it not for nice looks but looking for great functionality unfortunately it turned out to be nothing but trouble is advertised to support jumbo frames packets with size as big as 6 times more than standard packet of with properly configured network clients jumbo network can easily reach transfer speeds up to and more but with standard packets network can barely work up to so this switch certainly does work faster than old switch but hardly 2 times as fast when with jumbo frames it would be times faster when i noticed that supports jumbo it was huge factor for me to go ahead and purchase it i wish i knew it was all marketing lie ! upon receiving the product i was so excited so i disposed of packaging i know stupid me only to find out day later that jumbo does not work i am senior network engineer and i do use jumbo at work with great success with more expensive switches so i could not return or replace the product and my multiple calls to netgear support to resolve this were very frustrating and led nowhere they just could not or rather would not understand what i am talking about so i am stuck now with basic gigabit switch when similar model not even pretending to support jumbo could have been bought much cheaper from other vendor who does not do false advertising you decide for yourself
although displayed in accessories as a minolta xi compatible battery as a replacement for the battery that comes with the camera it is not and i had to return it
since this rechargable battery was clearly listed under accessories '' on the minolta dimage xi amazon web page i purchased one to serve as a backup it was delivered well before i received the camera imagine my surprise when i finally received the dimage xi and opened up the sharp battery package to find that the battery was too wide to fit in the camera or the battery charger which came with the camera ! this battery is not an accessory that fits with the dimage xi i have sent it back
i just bought my first imac i love the computer but hate the mouse it came with it it is always jumping all over the screen it is hard for me to control it the scroll function works okay and the design is nice and sleek i am definitely going to get another mouse before it drives me nuts
i own this product and it worked great when i first bought it after a few years the side buttons went out then the main button started to tweek out it would click on everything and anything when i was dealing with files and folders they would all of a sudden disappear becuase my mouse was clicking on them accidentally when i was moving it across the screen i had a lot of trouble with this because i hadno other mouse to plug in and return things to normal i pretty saavy with electronics so i opened it up there 's some very fragile circuit tape on the inside which broke fairly easily not a user friendly schematic i would n't recommend buying this product
at first i was excited about the mighty mouse the scroll ball worked very well freely scrolling in any direction the side squeeze buttons were a bad idea because they could activate by holding the mouse too tight but they can be disabled easily but the mighty mouse has a much more serious and annoying design problem the scroll ball gets dirty and there is no way to open the mouse and clean it ! the scroll ball collects dirt over time just like the trackball in older mouse but thanks to the brilliant engineers at apple their is no way to open and clean the inside of the mouse without potentially braking it after a while you will loose scroll functionality and have no reasonable way of fixing it within three months of use i could scroll down but not up the apple support people instructed me to clean it by repeatedly wiping the top of the mouse with a cloth this only sort of cleaned it the inside of the mouse was still dirty the scroll ball only works on and off with this method so cleaning it this way is clearly bs i 'm still struggling to understand apple 's reasoning with making a mouse that you can not open apple has made trackball mice for years and each one let you open it to clean the inside when the ball got dirty this is an essential feature i do n't understand why apple thinks a scroll ball on top of the mouse would not need to be periodically cleaned exactly the same way if you are buying a new computer from apple i suggest getting a regular optical mouse to go with it
i 'm a big mac user usually love their products but i got ta say this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment two reasons 1. the technology has never worked 2. the scroller just stopped working today after owning it for only a matter of months i can no longer stroll down just up and i 've just ordered a new mouse
this mouse is incredibly difficult to use there 's actually only one button the whole carapace of the mouse so your hand ca n't really be relaxed when you 're using it you continually have to concentrate in order to get true in order to get that true you want to grip the mouse but the only place on it that affords gripping without tending to cause is the two little pads on the right and left side alas if you grip those in the default mode you get expose which interrupts your attempt to if you reflexively follow through with the click most of the time you 'll get switched to another application because hey you just clicked on that app window in the expose screen the scroll ball is a nice idea but it 's about half the size it needs to be in order to afford a decent amount of control without that you get all kinds of false directionals scrolling when you 're trying to scroll and using the to is tricky as often as not even after you configure the to click as button 3 '' you as often as not get a funky mouse scrolling '' action an icon appears on screen and you can scroll the currently focused document by moving the mouse pointer not a crazy idea but totally when what i wanted to do was open the clicked link in a new tab basically this is a fussy fussy device that will be difficult for most people to use but since is looks so beautiful they 'll blame the problems on themselves and give it a high rating anyway
i 'm on my third mighty mouse in 3 years at 50 a pop i expect them to last longer ! inevitably after about a year or so the trackball stops scrolling in one direction or another i tried cleaning it with compressed air but no luck i always admire the mm 's functions for 12 or so months and then bam ! it chokes
my 10 dollar portable panasonic radio has better and clearer reception than this overpriced crap even if the radio is by my window reception is static and horrible do n't fall for the grunding name like i did you can get a high quality shortwave radio for much less panasonic makes one for 40 bucks ! ! ! amazon also carries that awesome panasonic portable for less then 10 bucks i feel ripped off by grundig boycott this crap
this machine was okay but i thought i could do better for my money the noise of the disk running was so loud when it was sitting on my lap that i had to turn the headphones all the way up that did not seem like a good solution also the swivel and the case were very cheap plastic it felt like it would not last long in the end i returned it and bought a more expensive but hopefully longer lasting sony swivel screen so far it is heads above the coby
i bought this unit for my wife and we are very disappointed for one thing this does not have the resume feature that means that when you are watching a movie and have to turn it off when you power up again it does not remember where you were in the film this feature is greatly missed the other problems are that the screen occassionally goes black the picture freezes the only way to fix this is to power the unit off and restart it this of course would n't be so bad if it just had the resume
used it for so learned about it it performed very well probably saved me at least an hour every day looking at maps and still getting lost as most gps products it does not have '' it tells you turn take exit but the name of street to turn on or number of exit is only displayed you have to look to see it so far i only used it as gps not as pocket pc
the netgear storage central device holds a lot of promise and offers a nice looking case design in fact i referred to mine as a network toaster '' since that is kind of what it looked like unfortunately beauty is only skin deep '' when it comes to this unit netgear did get some things right the ability to buy just the enclosure and add your own hard disks is great anyone who has worked on computers for some time will undoubtedly have some perfectly serviceable hard drives sitting around this unit gives you the ability to put at least some of those drives to use installation and use of the device when it works which it does n't always do are both easy and definitely geared to new and inexperienced computer users who just want something that works what netgear missed with this device however is the ability for more advanced users or people who have multiple computers with different operating systems to take this device further it offers no web based interface and no file sharing protocols outside of the proprietary software for windows only this is a serious flaw to an otherwise great idea the hard drives are also loose inside the device when you install them there 's nothing to hold them in place or keep them stable other than some blocks of foam i could see this leading to electrical shorting from the circuit board on the drive to the case and even serious disk damage in the event that this unit would fall the interior of the case is also quite sharp so watch out not to cut or slice yourself while installing drives or taking it apart to see what 's inside all things and limitations considered i returned mine after five minutes of using it it 's just too limited for the power user hobbyist or tinkerer if you pay full retail price 100 it 's also quite pricey for such a limited piece of hardware if netgear were to come out with a more powerful version that offered true network attached storage functionality i 'd certainly give serious thought to buying it as it is right now the product was an expensive disappointment to me
i 've had an for almost a year when it works it is super when it does n't support is poor and you are really on your own i 've had three different issues affecting data from three different machines accessing it over the past months none of the issues are discussed in the troubleshooting guide nor in the faq and email tech support has been completely unhelpful i 've been able to salvage my data each time yes ultimately i had it backed up and could recover if needed but the stability and support of the device makes it impossible for me to recommend it to anyone who feels they are an average home user i am a fairly technical user and have never had this kind of trouble with a pc product
i will not bother repeating the specific complaints of numerous reviewers in general this product should not even be sold it is not a real nas in any meaningful sense of the word there would be similar value in simply getting a hard drive since it is not as if a sonos or anything else could access it no real sharing get a real product i am embarassed for the retailers who actuallly sell this product it was the only nas available at the nearby office depot which is why i have this glorified doorstop as soon as i get my buffalo linkstation running again my fault that i bricked it not buffalo 's i will happily be taking this thing off my network and out of my life it does n't even support filename lengths permitted by windows or linux it really is an unbelievably poor product
i bought this with the hopes of up files for home and work pcs i already had the drives so this seemed like a good idea it took about 2 hours to configure the device the way i wanted to a 200 mb mirror and a 50 mb the mirrored partitions seem to have real problems the speed to the mirror are very slow and the mirror partition keeps getting corrupted to fix the problem requires that you download and use a command line application i am technically capable but i really do n't like having to 'fix ' the mirror partition whenever i want to use it i have one pc that ca n't even run the application to attach the drives it crashes when i open it also mentioned in previous posts it is annoying to have to load each pc with software to attach to the device the fact that it does n't use ntfs or cli format is another really annoyance i have to copy these drives to another ntfs drive in order to recapture the files i have on this device windows linux and mac ca n't read the format of these drives summation i would not buy this again i am now looking at the linksys product it would require me to buy two hd enclosures but at least then i could actually use it
nat storage 100 read the other reviews some positive and some negative and you should be able to get a good idea as to whether to take the plunge i have had mine for over a year basically i tend to ignore it copying a file or to it seems to work more times than not do a mass transfer and its slow and more than likely going to freeze and require a drastic reset unplug replug and reboot pc lose access to a partition and you are forced to use a command prompt and perfect syntax on a network and want faster and more reliable access buy yourself a good western digital external drive or two hook it up to the machine that runs the most and share access while its not mirrored the time it takes to manually sync two external drives is actually time saved
as a computer dork i wanted to get a little storage device for my home network 5 hours after i began the 10 minute '' process of getting the up and running and all i had to show for it was a lot of frustration and no working microsan '' if you are on getting one of these please make sure to read the netgear support pages thoroughly first as the description on the box seems wildly different than what is actually supported by the device
please please do not buy this thing there is a wealth of information by users out there with multiple problems and almost support if you do buy one do not mirror it ! use it only as a storage device without any of the raid features otherwise you will almost certainly lose your data ! i ultimately stopped using mine and went to a attached external drive enclosure much faster a more versatile good luck
the construction is pretty poor in my opinion bought these for my boys to play with and they did n't last a month the boys are 10 and 11. range is bad reception is bad battery life bad
i purchased these radios for a back up so to speak for my elderly mother we live approximately mile from each other and i wanted her to be able to reach me if she had an accident and could not get to a phone these walkie talkies worked great within 200 feet of her house but after that the range lost any chance of hearing her i would not reccomend them to anyone who needs something to rely on ! ! ! !
i purchased this phone and had it shipped directly to my elderly father in another state the description never indicated batteries were required and it did not come with batteries had i known i would have either ordered another phone or the batteries to go along with it instead the phone sat for 2 weeks waiting for one of dad 's caregivers to purchase batteries dad swears it does n't have a speakerphone option and since i have n't seen the phone i have no idea if it 's the correct phone if it does have the advertised speakerphone capabilities they are not as well marked as the other big buttons '' i 'm disappointed
i just drove 120 miles round trip to buy this mouse from a brick and mortar store because i was n't sure about the size for people with small hands a regular mouse is ergonomically uncomfortable and it is sometimes hard to find a small size mouse the grip is great and the feel is fine this is one of a very few mouses labelled as vista compatible so the choices are limited for a laptop pc this mouse is probably but the usb cord is less than 2 feet long thus if you 're using a big new microsoft ergonomic keyboard which has no onboard usb port and a full pc this mouse is not suitable i suppose one could place the pc on the desktop but that 's an irrational use of space but its probably the better plan than moving your desk so the pc is within 2 feet of your right hand i preferred the micro innovations travel mouse with its longer cord but my new microsoft office software queers it off although my old xp software on an earlier computer did n't and that is why i bought this one microsoft should redo excel add a generous mouse cord to this model add a usb port to its 4000 keyboard and certify other companies ' mice so folks know what will work as it is consumers are locked into a somewhat disfunctional set of conundrums
do not buy this if you are planning on using windows vista there are no not even beta drivers and the windows drivers do not work seems totally arrogant about the whole thing and there are no target dates for any driver support which has n't even been confirmed
the revolution 7.1 is listed as being mac compatible but with all the issues it has currently i am not sure how that is true i own a mirrored drive tower and have had nothing but problems with this sound card currently there is still no driver for anything past and if you upgrade any higher the card will not work in surround sound besides that there is constant speaker popping and horrible buzzing and squeals when switching between programs sometimes even when the computer is not in use it has been flakey with surround sound when using dvd player and quicktime as well during the 10 of times it works without a hassle the sound is great through my logitech speakers so it is quite sad when it does n't work it seems that this is the only option for mac users to achieve surround sound that i know of which is also very saddening i have a feeling i will be selling this to a pc user in the near future and just settling for good ol'stereo
if it 's not already obvious monster cable is the carpetbagger of the home entertainment world with the rapid development of new hd and audio technology monster cable does their best to be the first to provide cables but not without charging a horrendously inflated premium in this case all you 're getting for your 20 bucks is an '' converter and eight feet in between sony makes a great cable for less than four dollars and if the length is what you really need you can daisychain a couple of those together for still less than half of the price of monster cable 's offering it is important to be aware than in the world of electronics and in fact everywhere someone will try to rip you off
this is a very well constructed cable and is probably one of the best y cables however i have found the sound from the ipod to the to be very low much much lower than the signal from a cd player of the cd output loudness this forces you to turn the sound level way up both on the ipod and on the consuming lots of battery power on the ipod if you have a low power you may not be able to play it loud enough the sound quality is adequate but not great as one can expect for this type of y cable regardless of build quality i also purched the nyco ipod stereo link for comparison and the sound quality is much better with a much louder output volume louder than the monster cable the nyco is also more power efficient as it drains much less power from the ipod it does not go through the and also bypasses the volume control a good sign if you care about sound quality if you do n't need to recharge your ipod while you play though the cable to a i would definitely go with the nyco stereo link cable i am an audiophile enthusiast with quite a bit of experience in audio
i have had trouble with both mini plug and rca plugs they are too large to use with my player and my receiver they plug in part way and the connections are not tight enough to use i think it is due to the large cable size
i purposely bought this unit as it was one of two on the market with wireless rear speakers unfortunately within a day of plugging it in i noticed that electric smell that says something 's not happy in the unit '' coming from the disc changer i had n't even tried to plug in speakers yet since we had just finished the basement room this was meant for and had been using the hdmi cable to just play through the tv sound once the smell had cleared nothing worked no video no sound no nothing i have had to pay 26 to send it to new jersey for repair or replacement so i really ca n't comment on it 's overall quality yet much less the sound i 'll wait to see whether the replacement or repair is functional or report back on any difficulties this might entail so for now i give this a thumbs down especially since it has cost me more money and i am unable to use it during this interim
i recently purchased the receptor hd out of the box it was a fairly complex the antennas are totally inadequate i am 10 miles across water from seattle and neither antenna can pick up more than half the hd stations there i have an accurian from radio shack and it picks all the stations up with no difficulty using the same antenna s in the same place and it cost as much the receptor sound is boomy '' if you walk away from it all you can hear is muffled booming after 5 days the radio quit entirely boston acoustics was to emails and has only a toll number with long waits to speak to anyone they say they will repair it but i must wait for an ra and shipping is at my expense not a lot of confidence in their products ! listen and compare before you buy the accurian only lacks an input for external it sounds more balanced
i have had my nuvi for approx 6 to 7 months and overall i am somewhat satified initally i could see no flaws it was perfect i recommend the nuvi to 3 friends and they all bought one first impression features on the nuvi 660 are without a doubt very cool and a step above everyone else now to the not so good stuff which is really a deal breaker for me first after a month and half the unit locked up my friends locked up after 2 weeks of light use once a nuvi locks up it has to be sent back to garmin the reset does not work restarting it wont work nothing we both had the same issues and our units where replaced with refurbished units my second issue involves the suction cup which is insufficent to hold the nuvi properly onto the glass do not use it at all cost every car that it has been placed in the suction cup has failed and the nuvi to my horror has come falling back to earth each time for between 600 to 1000 buck you would think they could provide a more secure mount the dashboard mount that i have purchased works well the fm transmitter is not really a feature i would purchase the nuvi for if you live in a city the quality of the audio is poor at best bluetooth hand free communication is cool when it works and is not sending me false signals be very careful the nuvi has a small list of bluetooth enabled phones that it can work with very small if i pair my phone with the nuvi i get continious ghost calls to my nuvi every 3 to 8 minutes where i have to tell the nuvi to ignore or it will just keep ringing for a bit i wish i could continue recommending the nuvi like i once did but with all of the issues it 's kind of a lemon i have worked around most of the issues and it 's acceptable to use with many of it 's key selling points disabled so my recommendation would be to save some money and purchase a cheaper model with just gps the nuvi 's bells and whistles are not worth the expense i expect better from garmin really a let down
unfortunately comes with electronic format only what happen to people does n't had any computer with printer what i 'm going to do when i need information regarding the navigator on my road trip i only got this garmin 660 few days so far i 'm very happy with it except this lack of print owner 's manual ! this is a great gps direct me without any confuss got almost everything incluing a 3 months free trail of fm triffic message garmin should incluing a owner 's manual booklet in this high end price gps
when i first plugged the cable to the pc so it will be it worked well but after restart i do n't know what happened but windows xp could n't recognized it at all think is a cable failure because i tried in 2 computers and the same problem happene
bought the cable after 1 printing the usb connection failed so called manufacturer he said cable was broken and gave me a rma emailed tiger they said i would have to ship back at my own expense called amazon they gave me another person to contact at tiger they said to ship it back and they would reemburse me it would cost as much or more to ship back and since getting conflicting statements i do n't trust them to reemburse me would suggest you stay awa
when installed cd it can not be recognized by my lap top so i could not install it dump
i thought this tv would serve all our guest room needs to have everything and toshiba '' i was pretty excited ! it arrived just fine in a sturdy box no signs of rough treatment inside though the tv was cracked along the i thought well it 's visible if it 's beneath you like on the floor where it sat but maybe i can overlook that if i set it up on the tall table i had planned for it is if it worked when i plugged it in it did n't the packers had to know it was cracked when they packed it in it 's styrofoam and nice sturdy box and shipped it off i think toshiba should know about this problem which does n't make their company look very reputable to the consumer besides all that the set had been ok and had worked the weight of the thing is it 's about 80 lbs and large amazon was very honorable as i had anticipated took a few days to set up a retrieval time and after about a week they had already emailed me with refund info amazon is great 'll never stop shopping them i do however hope they report this problem to toshiba the warehouse people need some adjustments ! ! thanks for reading !
after 15 months of no problems the picture turned black no picture but had sound i had to have the picture tube yoke replaced at a cost of to me of 211.00 that repair lasted a month and then the tv repair place said that the picture tube needed to be replaced toshiba did pay for a new tube but the labor to install it was another 167.00 its been three months since that last repair and now the dvd player is starting to act up wo n't play some disks until after several attempts or the set is unplugged and then plugged back in i wo n't shell out more money to fix this lemon i bought this tv to replace a 16 year old 19 '' sharp tv in an oak cabinet nothing wrong with the sharp which was manufactured in japan but i wanted a bigger picture and the added dvd player and video recorder was a buying factor but the 19 '' sharp set still working perfectly has had to serve as my set in that spot while the 24 '' toshiba the cost of owning now totals over 700.00 has been in and out of the tv repair shop for over a period of two months while the tv shop waited for parts i have a 27 '' toshiba tv in my bedroom made in japan which has n't skipped a beat in over twelve years both of the toshiba tvs have a good sharp picture but this last purchase has been a very expensive dog of a tv this last set from toshiba is assembled in mexico using cheap parts and most likely unskilled labor
we purchased this tv with high hopes upon plugging it in there was a loud buzzing coming from the tv i had a samsung repairman come out and he said that it was normal and there was nothing they would do about it so i promptly arranged for the store where i had bought it to take it back and exchange it for a samsung lcd best decision ever although a bit more money stay away from plasmas if you live at elevation even if the manufacturer says it will work at your altitude
the microsoft wireless optical elite has been a less than satisfactory purchase for me although i like the feel of the keyboard i am still having trouble getting used to the layout and have found that it is easy to hit the thumbwheel on the left side causing the screen to scroll unexpectedly i 've found the placement and layout of the group of buttons to the right of the main keys and containing the delete pageup and pagedown buttons to be particularly troublesome i always seem to be hitting the wrong key and have sometmes brushed the delete key while typing with the usual unhappy results the driver is constantly telling me that i have low signal strength even though the wireless receiver is within 2 inches of the keyboard replacing the batteries has not helped i 've also found that it tends to skip characters while typing the mouse is a bit better it feels comfortable and works as expected with no surprises all in all although better than the keyboard on my laptop this is not a product i can recommend particularly given the price some of the lower priced wireless microsoft keyboards used by friends and family seem to work better and are better than this top of the line '' model
unimpressive glad i did n't pay the full 949.00 list pric
i am returning my second sangean radio i reordered because i did not believe that a radio that cost that much could have almost nonexistant am recieption i tried an external antenna with little improvement we are in a remote area however a 40 year old radio and a 18 dollar boom box both received a usable am signal in exactly the same location i bought this for a xmas present for my wife who likes to listen to talk radio i thought she would like the many nice features on this radio the fm has good sound this is the only reason i gave it a two star rateing they apparently forgot that you have to receive a signal before you can make it sound good
this pen keeps falling apart also it is difficult to use the recording part because you have to almost shout to record anything i am sorry i bought it
the looks nice but does n't work very well i could never get mine to turn on without taking it apart jiggling the batteries and then trying to turn it on again your money is better spent on a made product
the silver metal '' paint wore off within a few months and the plastic clip broke off so it can no longer be clipped to a pocket also the turning mechanism that exposes the pen tip no longer turns without great effort i bought this for my boyfriend and he got a few months of use out of it but now it 's basically junk neat design and fine quality of sound but not lasting
received dvd 's damaged due to inproper packaging by the vendor vendor refused to exchange damaged discs
i have been using a palm for the past 6 years and this is by far the worst it is constantly crashing i had to get rid of all my fun custom programs which is why i used to love the palm so much the touchscreen is slow ! i 'm guessing because of the flash memory it is hard to really get good use out of it even the most trivial things are wrong with this palm like there is no power light this means you ca n't tell whether or not it is charging i 'm so angry about that it often takes several nights of me plugging it in thinking it is charging all night only to wake up and realize that the cable mind you they got rid of the cradle was loose it is a good thing that it uses flash memory because i have drained the battery several times with this circus act i do n't like the new big size it does n't fit into my old reliable case which i had for 6 years and was very secure i like to clip the palm to my belt this thing is so big that it is constantly hitting my leg when i sit down and falling off so i keep it in my bag now and do n't use it nearly as much as i used to i loved the old palms so much they were quick adaptable portable and decently reliable but this thing is a clunking pain in the butt i am really ready to at least investigate the pocket pc 's
for some time i 've been buying a new palm every couple of years this is first time i 've really regretted my purchase i 'm now on my third tungsten having sent one then another in for warranty repair '' really they just replaced it the second one froze up and died after only one month at least the first one had lasted a few months before it died even the replacement i just got crashes with regularity i have n't even installed any software on it yet the goes completely out of alignment every few hours sometimes so badly i can hardly get into settings '' to fix it the sd card reader is also not working i probably wo n't send it back over that though because i 'm sick of paying to send it in for repairs '' when it 's working properly i generally like it i 'm annoyed that it has no vibrate '' function though i do n't know why they eliminated it and i wish it had wifi capability instead of just bluetooth at this point i 'd really just like to get my money back but it 's too late
i have had the now for about a year i am surprised that i put up with it for so long it constantly freezes the web program is buggy today i lost all my settings in short what you read here is correct this is a flawed product and should have never been released stay away from it
i have owned a palm since they were first produced by us robotics this is by far the worst for reliability i never had any problems with prior models palm 500 palm iii palm iiixe this is the second i have had i returned the first one because it constantly locked up just like an old windows pc and when it was working the would fail a lot of the time i am ready to send the replacement they sent me back because the battery lasts about 2 days even when i am not using it then i have a hard time getting it to turn on i usually have to leave it plugged in for an extended period of time until it finally decides to turn itself on what a waste of money i wish i still had my palm iiixe
i just have it for a couple weeks and the first time i pulled from it the cable broke and there is no easy way to fix it i had other brands of headsets and they have last me for years but this one was extremely easy broken i mean the headset is fine but the part were the two cables join in one is not fuse so every time you pull by accident from them you are pulling on the inside extremely easy to break
i bought this dvd player for the capabilities but i now have a much bigger problem i ca n't watch any of my dvds this player seems to be extremely sensitive to the slightest scratch or smudge and it really does not like discs i 've burned myself every time i use it there 's a 50 chance it wo n't load the disc at all i have to wait about 5 minutes to find out if it does load it will likely stop several times and probably never start up again very frustrating ! do n't know what is wrong with this thing but i 've tried dozens of discs with the same result i 'll be looking for something else this thing just does not work
both amazon and sony present this power supply as suitable for the sony radio check sony 's web page only when you receive the wretched thing and go through the slashing cutting and hacking that modern packaging requires do you find that this item is completely useless with the radio emitting a loud hum that drowns out any reception now i have to package it up write and explanatory letter to amazon and try to get my money back then i 'll have to find a power supply that is suitable for the radio i have a feeling that i am not going to be successful as one of the other reviewers has found so now i 'm stuck with a radio that will only function with batteries after it was presented as being compatable with a charger why else would it have a female input for a dc jack to say that i am annoyed is putting it mildly what a bloody scam !
summary adaptor could create interference if used with am radios acceptable for cd or other applications the rating applies to use with radios only not recommended evaluation the ac adaptor is typically presented as a better together '' purchase recommendation for sony 's portable radio however information on the adaptor 's package specifically states that the adaptor is not recommended for use with radios due to potential interference the unstated reason for this is that the power supply in the adaptor is a switching supply which creates interference particularly for am signals the adaptor should work with cd or players without any problems as this is the intended application note i am basing this recommendation on the information sony provides on the package i have not tried it i returned the adaptor unopened to amazon for refund
this adapter is not for use with a radio ! i live in a fairly strong signal area and the noise from this adapter totally wipes out am 800 a station ! which is what i listen to most often !
even though this ac power adaptor was listed on the amazon website as an accessory for a sony portable transistor radio the instructions with the radio and the power adaptor both clearly state that it is not suited for use with a radio because it will cause the radio to hum ! ! ! ! sure enough it is totally unusable with a radio because of the hum ! ! ! the only ac power adaptor to be used with a sony portable radio is a sony model which is unavailable through amazon or anywhere else that i can find ! !
i recently purchased this item along with a sony radio for which it is listed by sony as an accessory do n't buy this item for use with any radio sony or other as it produces static at lower frequencies and a steady loud hum at higher frequencies when i called sony about this the person with whom i spoke indicated an awareness of the problem the recommended adaptor is an but it is not available in the us ! it is listed on the sony style canada site but they will not ship to the us catch 22 completed
i had a sony multiple handset phone that i loved unfortunately i found when i moved into a bigger house that the phone had been discontinued and i could no longer get additional handsets for it i purchased the at t 5840 to replace it and i suppose my disappointment with the handsets is probably more based on the fact that they pale in comparison to the former sony ones than that there is anything intrinsically wrong with them my primary complaints with the handsets are these 1. the blue light that indicates that the handset is charging is bright enough to make it hard for me to get to sleep at night 2. the caller id lists incoming calls strictly based on what the phone company has in their system cellular call '' instead of the name of the caller the sony phone would display a name for any number i had stored in memory so if i had stored a number as annoying guy '' that is what the caller id would say when that person called and of course it also displayed my friends ' names or nicknames as i had entered them too this was particularly useful for me as i have a terrible memory for numbers and need a name in order to know who is calling this is the feature i am most disappointed about losing 3. the phone does not automatically store caller id numbers in a format that allows me to call back with a single button press in order to call a person back from the caller id feature i have to hit cid then opt and then select the appropriate number format although this process is not excessively difficult it 's annoying when i used to have a phone that allowed me to simply hit 'talk ' to call a person back it is also more difficult due to issue number 4 below 4. the menu buttons 'wear out ' after regularly using the menu buttons for about a year i have found that it now requires me to really push them hard and sometimes several times to get them to work i would recommend this phone to people who a have a great memory for numbers and do n't need a name listed on the caller id and b people who do n't push buttons often it does what a phone is meant to do and so far aside from the failing button issue i have had no maintenance issues with it i just became spoiled with all the features of my previous phone and this one just does n't come close in comparison
prior to my zen v plus i had a creative muvo tx fm which came with an armband and belt clip in the box it was a very comfortable and easy to use until it was stolen as a replacement i thought i would upgrade to the zen unfortunately the armband for the zen v plus had to be purchased separately i chose to go with the creative branded band based on my previous experience to my surprise the creative armband is too small for me now i 'm '' but i 'm not much of a weight lifter so my biceps are only 14 '' however the available strap length is less than that so i can not get a comfortable fit it fits too tightly and tends to pops open as i try to secure it due to lack of slack i looked online and found that the average male bicep is 13 '' in circumference about the same as the armband 's strap as previous reviewers have stated the included silicon skin is nice but it seems that this unit was designed for women children and smaller than average men so guys unless you have a 12 '' bicep or smaller i would look elsewhere for an armband to use while you work out
i purchased the creative zen v plus player during the first week in february i am returning it and this is why the package arrived from amazon i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there then i accessed through the computer just fine all my songs all of them are in format from for my audio books to for the songs i ripped from cd 's the player just would n't read about half my songs there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks this happened with my entire music collection so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update it did not solve the problem i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why they have the worst customer department of any company i have ever spoke with after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a or language i arrived nowhere they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place so i tried a fourth call this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i ca n't believe you americans '' and then mumbled something in another language i asked for a supervisor he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in days then he hung up i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also do n't plan on buying anything from creative again by the way after all this the problem never was fixed also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files this is not true this player will not play any files without being converted first i took an avi video that was and it converted it into a file the format they use is absolutely a waste of space if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire of space if not more i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie i was wrong the movie took up after being converted i would not recommend this product to anyone as much as i do n't like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because 1. it plays all my music 2. they have a customer support that helps you and cares about its customers i hope this helps anyone looking at this player jeff
while i have always followed the adage of you get what you pay for '' i have to say that i was hoping for more even in this price range while i am no stranger to assembling furniture such as this my cabinet had several pieces that just did n't quite line up and consequently caused me to a few holes additionally while the black veneer is of the quality that one would expect in this range it was already separating from one of the corners after only a week of ownership nothing a little wood glue did n't fix but it 's still a disappointment lastly the cabinet is very wide but has a very shallow depth causing it to be fairly unbalanced if you are n't careful about where you place your media i initially loaded the cabinet at the top and left the bottom empty it tipped over forward spilling the contents and creating quite a mess i shudder to think of the consequences if it had fallen on a child or a
overpriced piece of plastic that will only fit the garmin geko unit though the description mentions that fact nowhere
i have already returned the wrong items you sent me just return my money please
i spend top dollars for this piece of crap wanted something to save weight and time so i do n't have to carry everything around with me to school but it was doa dead on arrival should have spend the money on a cheaper notebook cooler but as always amazon was there to the rescue and refunded my money the next day
this is the fourth device my husband and i have had die over the last several years quality control seems poor granted my zire 31 lasted about 2 years and worked fair some compatibility issues with my mac and some medical software epocrates good for basic tasks calendar etc small memory limits many of the newer applications my husband 's zire 31 seemed to have battery trouble after about 1 yr but after multiple attempts at fully charging syncing and hard resets his still functions mine just will no longer turn on despite any actions
this palm is dated you should spend the extra 100 and get something a little more up to date
i have had it less than a year and charging the battery as with all the palms is a major disappointment they do n't last very long palm is great but what is great if it does n't charge thanks to service plans i have exchanged every palm i have had due to defective batteries now they know better and do n't have the plans like they used too my advice buy something with a replaceable battery you can do yourself
i purchased this case in pink about a month ago and i feel much safer carrying it around in my purse or backpack it really protects the screen and everything nicely with the leather i also enjoy the kickstand which is very handy when watching videos or pictures and the way it snaps in the back is convenient however 1. having to take it out of case out to charge and dock minor setback but one nonetheless 2. the buttons do n't work as easily in the case many times i 'll go to pause a song and it 'll flip to the next one instead because the edge of the leather where it 's cut for the scrollpad is on the 'next song ' button most of the time i end up taking the player out of the case when i use it because it 's a lot less frustrating that way 3. bulky again it just hinders the use of the player and i 'm amazed at how thin it actually is when i take it out to dock or charge which with the battery life is several times a week haha 4. i 'm not sure if this has happened with other color cases but my case has left pink stains all over the back of my player luckily my player is black so just the back is stained but i 'm sure white players or maybe even the other 3 colors could get stains on the front too so if you could n't tell i really was n't satisfied it 's too late to return mine believe me if i could i would and the only reason i 'm not getting a different case is because it was over 30 with shipping and to spend another 20 would be a bit rediculous my friend got one of the flexiskin covers and they seem to allow use of the player much better although i 'm not sure how well they protect the screen bottom line i highly highly recommend getting a case for your player just not this one the vision m is an amazing and fairly expensive player that deserves to be protected and while this case does that the design poor really hinders the use more than it helps
the case did fit the player very well and did excellent in protecting it but 1. you have to remove the player to charge because the charger isnt that small leaving scratch marks on the zen 2. it is kinda bulky cant fit in any pockets 3. must remove the zen if you want to use the microphone feature i just bought the silicone case with screen protectors works just as good doesnt leave scratch marks much much smalle
i had a zen vision m in pristine condition and carried it with only a screen protector to protect it decided to get a case did n't want to push my luck after one night in this case it 's full of scratches including 2 big ones on the screen so buyer beware i wish i 'd never purchased this case now i have to buy something to remove the scratches stick with a pda protector
i ordered this by i used them i just have to say i 've gotten better batteries at a dollar dont waste you hard earned money
i have found this site disappointing on finding my tri color ink 78 that i need for my hp 750. this web site needs more choices if the store sells it you should be able to find it here
i saw spacenavigator pe at macworld controlling google earth it worked i was very impressed i tried it at the macworld expo i ordered one then i had to return it because it only worked with one or two apps and i only wanted for google earth and now i find out there is no drivers ! what 's wrong with the mac software that was shown at macworld why ca n't users download and use the macworld software until the next release
the item does n't work properly the video quality is okay there is a loud background static type of noise both on the tv and on the computer video card when i attempted to record a show the background noise makes the product useless
canon calls this a photo printer prints are faded blurred and distorted compare this printer to an hp deskjet 3940 and decide for yourself do not invest in this printer however if you are stuck with this printer because you bought it as a package deal either sell it on ebay or give it to your kids i repeat do not buy this printer you will be sorry every canon printer i have ever purchased has not met my expectations
the printing is ok but the photo printing is terrible this printer simply can not print black in photo mode i used the canon photo paper plus glossy one of canon 's premium photo papers the blacks look gray the colors are dull it reminds me of a newspaper photo the review on cnet is misleading it says that the colors were a bit washed out but they were impressed nevertheless the only thing that can impress me is how much the colors are washed out i own quite a bit of canon photo equipment and i can not believe that canon can make such a terrible product the printer came free with a laptop that i bought and i did not have high expectations for it of course but i did not expect it to be that bad for photos i have seen photos from 80 printers that are brilliant compared to this one canon should have advertised this as an office printer with color capabilities the photo lab quality '' sign on the box is a big lie after a few tests i put the printer back in the box and i will give it away
i am really not able to understand what is this cheap kind of strategy not to provide usb cable with this product especially when thats the only interface available technically can someone make me understand the logic business sense behind this especially for a canon like brand ! ! definitely consumers expect much better from canon canon '' please bring better business sense to market that would help end thanks
i bought this printer as part of a package the package included the computer monitor and printer i did n't really need the printer but the price was great for the and the printer was basically a freebie i hooked up the computer system i thought about the printer i already had it was older and jammed once in a while when i was printing so i decided what the heck i 'll hook up the new printer i unboxed it and was starting to hook it up i looked for the usb cable i could n't find it started examining the styrofoam packing materials to see if it was shoved in some crevise or other no cable then i looked on the instructions and the show the contents of the box printer power cord cartridges and they did n't show a usb cable on the outside of the box they also show contents and in tiny little print it says usb cable not included '' what kind of cheap manufacturer does n't include a usb cable with a usb printer it 's not like i have a choice of whether to go usb or parallel the printer only does usb without a usb cable the printer is a paperweight in order to use this printer for anything you will have to buy a usb cable ! why did n't they include one it is just stupid
my first complaint out of the box with these headphones was the smell of the rubber they smelled like rotton meat ! my main complaint is the fit of the ear buds themselves they do not fit properly in my ears and constantly fall out if i try to them for fit they hurt my ears they do fine for the podcasts i listen to overall avoid these like the plague
yesterday i bought this item based on the 4 to 5 star reviews here and elsewhere unfortunately this product was a disappointment it does n't deliver much bass or treble and like the other reviewers have said it 's a nice look but your ears will get sore after they are used for a short period of time luckily i was able to take them back and get a refund to go with the pink ipod nano i recently bought a pair of sony pink earbuds and not only are they confortable they deliver a nice sound for a cheap price for the time being i am going back to them and the philips behind the neck headphones jvc can do better
i would n't buy these again and wish i had n't paid so much for them either around 9 i 've had them for less then 5 months at first they were perfect because they matched my pink ipod i thought the gooey stuff would feel nice etc i did n't have any problem with the sound quality the problems i had with it is the first month after i would use them the outer ear where they sit would feel sore i do n't listen to the music loud either so it was n't that my ear does n't hurt anymore after a use so you will get use to the discomfort then main reason i would n't buy this earphone again is because the white cord sticks with dirt like glue after awhile no matter what i used clorox wipes water hand soap i could n't get it to return to it 's nice white color and now it looks or basically dirty i also did n't like the part that connects the earphones to the ipod or whatever you connect it too for me i like to slip my ipod in my back pocket when i need to use both hands for something well because there is a bend in the plug it pops out of my pocket disconecting from the ipod the ipod earphones stick straight out and are as thin as the ipod since i 'm a student i have n't gotten around to or feel like spending money to get another different set i strongly advise you not to buy this product if anything i would recommend the normal ipod earphones or keep searching for some better ones
the buds do n't fit very well and fall out they caused a continual pain and made the outside of my ears soar from the many attmepts of fitting them inside my ear would not recommend or buy agai
wow i never thought i write a bad review on amazon i thought the pink color and jvc are good ! ay ! they are huge and they sound is bad the bass is but when you get to a album like garbage '' bleed like me album it is like nails on chalkboard well i thought since there were so many good reviews i bought it but maybe it 's me but they are would think the gummy design would be comfortable
i 've had a pair of really bulky 12 sony headphones for years now i hate the way they look but they fit and sound great i saw the gumy headphones in my college bookstore and they were so cute i could n't resist frankly i do n't understand what the other reviewers see hear in them the sound quality they produce is awful and when i walk they nearly fall out of my ears and my music takes on this weird thing maybe i have deformed ears but these did not work out for me they are gorgeous discreet and cheap though
cobra hg high gear cb antenna has an item model number hg and the cobra hg high gear cb antenna has an item model number hg so clearly it seems the inventory numbers are erroneously called two weeks no fix and called today hopefully it 's corrected since i ca n't settle with the lower wattage rated antenna
i read the reviews and everyone had received the 1000 instead of the ordered 1500 and i thought surely that problem had been fixed by now bad guess i received my 1000 instead of the ordered 1500 today 17 so it seems that amazon is making no effort to correct the problem it did n't even matter that the shipping order indicated a 1500 and the order a 1000 was shipped do n't know yet what to do with it as others have received the wrong item more than once this is unlike amazon
ordered an antenna the middle of nov 05. received wrong item with in 10 days i let them aware of problem then i mailed back wrong item within 14 days i received duplicate of wrong item after i emailed them to let them know of problem i heard nothing i had to send an ugly email stating what 's up '' they cancelled my order then refunded original amount charged to credit card plus cents still fighting for them to reimburse me for my cost to send back 2 wrong items
i recently ordered two of these antennas and have not yet had the opportunity to set them up on my cb radios for a test run however i did want to comment about the packaging for the products which i purchased from the antennas arrived inside their original mgf display packs which had been placed inside a narrow rectangular cardboard box with a strip of plastic air bags on either side for packing material however this did not prevent the cardboard box from collapsing bending during shipping which in turn bent the stainless steel antennas inside their packaging about degrees i have spent the last couple of hours trying to straighten the antennas the stainless steel material is not easy to straighten by hand and i still am not done working with one of the antennas it would have been nice if the packaging had been better the boxes marked as fragile so this would not have happened i am confident that these units will preform very well but am not happy with the shipping thus the 2 star rating
i suppose the operation of the unit works fine we have no complaints there we are concerned with the smell that the unit outputs we have extreamly hard water and are using the demin filter that came with the unit as soon as we started the humidifier there was a sharp smell coming out with the vapors has anyone else experienced this or knows how to fix it
brought this home and immediately there are problems it will only work if the unit is tilted so i put a napkin folded up under one side it seems a little silly there is some sensor in there that needs to be in contact with water and somehow mine only works with the leaning tower '' this one
i recently purchased 2 vicks ultrasonic humidifiers in jan 2006 and received them by the week of jan 06. on 2 feb 06 having used them only 2 weeks one of them stopped putting out the humidifying vapor i followed the manual 's instructions to the letter by cleaning the tank with bleach and the base i used vinegar to clean what white dust if any since i 'm using the cartridge it might have having followed the manual instructions to the letter the humidifier turns on but there is no mist coming out of the mist nozzle i plan in contacting the manufacturer for a replacement or refund good luck to those of you who are considering in purchasing a vicks ultrasonic humidifier !
the unit stopped working after three days i spent a long time on the phone waiting for kaz customer service and they just told me to return it to where i purchased it from the unit was also louder especially when the water tank was low than my douglas ultrasonic humidifier that still works after about 10 years i use reverse osmosis water in the humidifier so the white mineral dust is not a problem for me i will try the venta sonic next
we thought it was great until we started noticing white dust on everything we changed the filter but that did n't help and we 've been using soft distilled water we 've got to get a different one ! i do n't recommend this humidifier unless you want to dust off white dust off everything everyday no fun
recently i bought an epson to replace my epson big mistake after only 20 or so prints the printer ran out of ink i mean all six cartridges were almost empty black was totally out first i thought well maybe the cartridges that came with the original packaging were not totally full i went out and got me a new set of six cartridges dolars after 26 prints again out of ink i used to get about 175 200 with the old it is ridiculous you actually see the ink level go down as you print excelent print quality lousy ink usage did i mention that i was using the lowest possible setting for the quality of prints when i contacted epson the answer was get the continuos flow ink system nice answer
i used this printer about 20 times to print mostly black text titles on cds the printer then refused to print anything and showed the printer as being out of ink i was pretty upset because i figured epson just included some starter ink cartridges with the printer that would last a short time so i 'd have to buy their expensive ink replacements the printer software said all the cartridges were empty well i did n't feel like i had mush of a choice so i bought the 75 package of 6 ink cartridges i did n't really understand why the color cartridges were out of ink since i had n't printed but maybe 2 or 3 of the 20 labels with color but again i chalked it up to starter cartridges and the manufacturer pushing their expensive replacements i installed the new cartridges and everything seemed to be ok the first couple of times i printed but over the next few print sessions the ink just seemed to be sucked right out of the printer once again the cartridges were empty after about 2 dozen cd labels i 'm just going to toss the printer and go back to sharpies they last a lot longer and are cheaper to replace you can even get them in different colors that wo n't run out of ink when you print with a black one bottom line epson cost me over 3 per cd to apply text labels to my cds last thoughts i wish i could award negative stars to this product because it was a very negative experience would i buy another epson product never ever again ! !
beware this is the most expensive printer you 'll ever own my wife went through 120 of ink in less than a month and she does n't print that much just text no pictures i had read the other reviews about excessive ink usage but it is much worse than i imagined i 'm going to throw away a perfectly good printer because i refuse to pay that much for ink this printer is also noisy with a lot of vibration the hp printers i 've owned are practically silent compared to the epson 260. i will never buy another epson printer
this thing makes great photo prints and does an acceptable job with output but it costs an arm and a leg to operate after i had made 20 or so x 11 photo prints with the option it needed four of the six ink cartridges replaced it also eats up an eighth of each cartridge priming the pumps each time you turn it on so this thing costs 10.00 to turn on it costs 3.00 per print you could take your prints to kinko 's and tip the counter gal a buck and still make out i 'm going to throw it out when my current supply of ink cartridges is gone
this printer only printed about 10 dvds and ran out of ink the replacement ink cartridges cost more than the printer i called epson on two different numbers to try to get the facts about the ink quantity in cartridges and no one seems to know the answer they gave me a third telephone number which is not an 800 number and it does n't work the qualtiy of printing on dvds is very good but the printer does not function well and has to be restarted at the beginning of each print job this is a very time consuming process i could live with this but the ink cost is too high about 120.00 for a printer that is available for about 60.00
this is one of the most frustrating things that has happened to me so i bought my macbook a week ago and to go a long with it i bought the marware protection pack the purpose i bought the cover for was to protect my notebook however the hand rest cover has ruined my notebook there is a sticky residue that is left behind when i peeled back the hand rest today it is all over the hand rest portion of my laptop keep in mind that it has been a week i am irritated and upset that marware has sold me such a negligible product
this battery has while the sony has go for the sony
brought two of these on vacation had them run out on me faster than it seemed they should do not seem better than energizer nor duracell i bought some lithium energizers to use for my next trip i was using them in a canon digital camera which works with normal alk batteries bought these as a get to 25 '' fill in purchase at amazon
the idea is great the implementation is terrible to start with the remote should n't really be called a remote since you have to be within 5 feet for it to work it does n't play correctly the software that you have to run on your computer is clumsy everything about this product is wrong this thing is a total piece of normally produces nice products but they completely missed with this one
the feature that originally sold me on the was its support for the xvid and divx formats these however are the two formats that are supported the least and a slow jerky framerate should be expected i at first thought it was a bandwidth issue and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable the framerate improved but not enough in my opinion for this device to even claim support for these file types if support for these two formats are the selling feature for you be warned you should look elsewhere
unfortunately i picked this unit up with much higher hopes than i should have setup was relatively simple i know what i 'm doing and i have an existing upnp server on my network so that made life a little easier when you power the thing up for the first time it steps you through network setup locates upnp servers and makes it all go however once i got it running i lost my optimism video was very choppy it was completely unwatchable i futzed with the settings on my router and upnp server and video formats for a week before finally giving up
even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers i still purchased it it is pretty easy to set up but once connected to my pc it had very inconsistent behavior the device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for hours and require a reset the video performance was awful with the included software tversity freeware media server made video performance better but fast forward and rewind would n't work do to some video conversion routines being run by tversity music files would play and sounded good but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature does n't work really does n't work at all i upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work finally i gave up and shipped it back to amazon the thing was just more trouble than it was worth fyi amazon returns were great
i know that taiyo yuden manufactures quality professional blank media but these are from from it there is no proof on the cd hub that identifies them as taiyo yuden already i have had 2 out of 10 cds that did'nt record any data during a live church service although the tascam pro unit we use showed that recording was in process buyers beware !
i bought this camera and just when i am out of the country installing it i get the tech support guys tell me to send it back lost my money never again buy dlink this was my first and last dlink product
i have 4 different sources that read memory stick pro and i have sony lexar sandisk ms pro cards that read well in all 4 sources but this new one does not read in 3 sources i have one is epson printer pc with win xp pack multimedia the last my sony digital still camera they all worked fine with any ms pro cards the only source that read this ultra ii card was hp pavilion laptop with sandisk imagemate card reader usb '' win xp pack home the have no clue of this problem but would not replace it with a new one either they do not think it is a defective what good is this product if the images can not be downloaded to your computers will charge 50 for returning this opened product so i am stuck and feel very much deceived so unless you use psp other pc users should be more careful choosing this product the correct name is ultra ii memory stick duo '' when you find more info in but they do not have anything that i can download to patch my system yet
there is an entire series of these cameras produced by dlink which can be grouped into one product line this being the most expensive of the line would have the least reviews and exposure read about the others before buying i was just called to a new client site last week that has 11 cameras installed of the 11 half at any given time will drop off the network lock up he was continually calling his exiting tech guy who performed the install to reset them and eventually called me in because he was n't getting in his own words what he paid for '' i 've used netstumlber and a few other apps to verify the wireless network health which in my opinion is very good at the farthest point i am still receiving 92 signal with a linksys router other devices on his network are problem free the issues are isolated to the cameras short of recommending the client box them and send them back for a refund i 've emailed dlink for any opinions or aftermarket fixes '' they are running the latest firmware i 've tried to pick a few up on to at least test them in a controlled environment but spending 400 per camera when there are obvious problems would not be something i would be willing to invest in it would be something i would be interested in since if they do work as promised i could recommend them to future clients my credentials officer and instructor cissp have a year networking business serving major brokerage houses in manhattan and have a smaller business auditing networks recommending network security and wireless solutions i will if dlink provides an actual solution aim is my username above if anyone has jumped this hurdle 10 days have passed and not a peep back from dlink tech support considering that the inquiry was for a 6500 total dlink purchase which was detailed in the it would lead someone to believe that selling is important support is not i called their sales line and someone immediately picked up sorry ford motors in 1908 would n't have survived if their failed to start most '' of the time the cameras were boxed up and sent back i was able to pull a few down and place them in a controlled environment for testing of the 3 i tested 1 locked up within 24 hours not a good score still they also are trying to get into the infrastructure market with hubs switches and larger corporate items i support over users on my main account and their line is one i ca n't recommend waiting for dlink not too confident they will get back to me
's so inconvenient that you must remove the nano in order to charge it up had i known this i would n't have purchased it ! would rather get one of the skin '' covers disappointing
i got this as a christmas gift i found it extremely hard to use cueing or skipping songs is easy enough but hitting the mode '' key is very awkward i ca n't store it in my pocket or bag because the power '' key will inevitably get hit i went through 3 batteries in 2 weeks even the directions on cd and in writing are very confusing at first i thought i could n't use it with mac os on the plus side i had no problem loading songs onto it or getting them off with mac osx the backlight is easy on the eyes this is basically a flash drive which is fine i 'm not looking for something that plays vidoes however it should n't be so hard to play a podcast or some tunes on the whole i 'm disappointed
this was sent from nextar as a replacement for a defective macvision i ordered for my daughter it took 3 weeks to send in the original they do n't return calls in 48 hours as their voicemail states and then it took another 3 weeks for them to get me a replacement which was a step down in price and options from the one it was replacing for about a week this player worked and then it started to do the same things the original did would not play a full song and then goes into a starting 'loop ' i would not buy another product from this company
i 've used several other versions of this product and this seems to be the one that works the best and is the most durable the design makes it easy to insert and remove ipod unlike the newer versions and the elasticity of the armband makes it easy to slide on and off one 's arm i would highly recommend this product
i got one of these my shuffle do n't waste your money ! ! ! horrible design with the velco in the back against your skin if you do work up a good sweat running the moisture will seep right through and soak your shuffle the velcro at the top and bottom seams is woefully shuffle died after only 2 months the repeated exposure to moisture sweat via running did it in and the earplug access is um a challenge as best keep looking
i expected these earbuds to sound better than my original ear buds that came with my ipods they did not they sounded terrible and anything coming out it becomes distorted and flat there is a large sound quality reduction going to this from my original ear buds i advise no one to buy this if they want to listen to stereo music however they are comfortable and block out sounds to some degree since it fits well in your ear if you are into reading and not listening to music the sound quality is acceptable i do n't know why everyone else thought this sounded good
unfortunately the jbuds were disappointing to say the least purchased after reading reviews of the headphone but after one flight with it i had to return it it did almost nothing to reduce the ambient noise inside the airplane purchased jvc for 20 and am very happy with it it has foam ear pieces for far better noise reduction and comfort hope this helps
1 the remote control is broken 2 when the tv is on a noise is also on 3 there is a fissure on the left side of the cover 4 feel so lucky that it still takes cable and displays
they are decent headphones sound quality wise i have very complaints in that department however even after a few minutes they can become very painful to wear i suppose you get what you pay for but usually philips is better than this needless to say i plan on returning them also just a side note the current picture featured in this product listing is not what the headphones look like i 'm not sure what model those headphones are but the actual look nothing like that hopefully amazon will fix that soon amazon has updated this product listing now the picture now matches what the headphones actually look like
i would n't buy anything from this company they have the worst customer service i have ever seen i got the product working despite the unbelieveably poor documentation but the output on my monitor showed ghosting and poor image quality i called them and after waiting almost an hour on hold they said swap the cables and call us back '' at least that 's what i think he said he barely spoke english i tried their recommendation and it made no difference called them back and they said the product was defective after asking me 8 or 9 completely rediculous questions said i should ship it back to them at my cost and they would ship me a new one in a few weeks '' ! i told them i did n't think that was a very good policy i 'd only had the product 2 days and that if that was their policy i would n't buy their products they said your choice goodbye '' that was it well i do have a choice and you do too
product was missing ac adapter could n't even plug it in after hassling with it and trying to rummage around to find an ac adapter to work with it i gave up and packaged it up and returned it instructions and documentation are horrible would not recommend this product
switch did not work with my samsung monitor customer service people were slow to respond and were not helpful
it 's a great looking monitor i 'm not an expert so i ca n't compare the quality of the image it looks good to me problems are the constant buzz and the height adjustment which were both mentioned here the monitor is way too bright and when you reduce the brightness a constant very annoying buzz starts with all the noise in an office environment it may not be a problem but at home where it 's silent this bugs me a lot the height is not adjustable and very low the other reviewer is spot on it 's not usable as is my neck started hurting in couple of days how can they miss this no idea
yes this monitor has all the big tech numbers whatever they mean to me that does n't mean squat when it 's not pleasing to the eye the colors on the screen are not consistent it 's brighter on the bottom then on the top if you look at it while moving your head up and down you 'll see it change that 's why you get a difference when you 're looking at it straight on the new cheaper tn panels they 're using have a different viewing angle than previous ones a lot of the monitors the electronics stores sell are of this type the display models are deceiving because they run a video loop that makes the picture look beautiful but when you get it home and start running your apps on it that 's when you start seeing the flaws also this model has an annoying blinking blue light when it 's in sleep mode
i purchased this while hoping to find a cable that would power my hard drive it wo n't do it if you just need capabilities you can find a cheaper cord than this that will do that there is no need to ever buy this cable
i had this unit for almost a year working perfectly loved it then one day the bluetooth just stopped working it will not connect and the blue light does not come on definitely appears that somehow the bluetooth stopped working for some reason holux has no support number and they have not returned any of my emails to tech support asking for help after several months of trying to reach them i am finally giving up i would not buy this unit especially now reading how many people are having similar issues i like the look of the holux 240 but the support from holux is disgusting
like other reviewers i 've had 2 units as a result of warranty returns the units work for a while and then the bluetooth begins to fail to connect on power up if you have multiple bluetooth receivers it will fail with all of them the diagnostic light for bluetooth is simply inaccurate
very flaky with bluetooth after few days no support phone do n't waste your
i bought this device and it worked great for about 60 days it would connect to the satellites quickly and held a long charge after the first 60 days the bluetooth light barely ever comes on and if it does it may never full initialize or turn back off within a few seconds buy something better this unit is not worth your time or money
this item works great when it works i purchase this item and the bluetooth transmitted ceased functioning in less than 30 days the company which i purchased it from replaced the unit and the new one stoppped functioning fot he same reason about 90 days later akronics the vendor will not even answer emails holux who has a year warranty on these devices does not respond to emails to its service center from what i have been able to find out is that the bluetooth problem is a common occurance and the unit is temperature sensative this is odd in that it is a mobile unit intended for the car and dashboard positioning so if you want to throw away your money buy holux or learn from my mistake
my unit failed after one day of use never even got to the field plugged it in to charge it overnight and next day only the blue led would come on but could no longer connect bluetooth connections can be tricky and the paper manual provided is worthless the manual better but is still way too spartan for a device like this i liked the standard cable connection for the charger similar feature on my razr but i found it vexing that you could n't use that same cable for data it appears to be a standard cable but instead have to buy a special '' cable for using the data port they give you the mobile and ac charger but the omission of a data cable seems odd other units using bluetooth and usb such as the by wintec provide this i found a lot of complaints and kudos for this unit surfing for solutions to my issues so it appears that their are some quality control problems in the manufacturing folks with working units seem to love them if you get one with the bad solder connections you are disappointed
i am an air force trained techie and have been for over 15 years i have a lot of experience with computers and electronics after a lot of research i went with the hollux initially i was very pleased with the device until it started having problems at first it would never lock on with the satellites yellow light stayed on i found out the unit went into sirf protocol mode i had to find a program called sirf demo to get it out of sirf protocol and placed it into the usable protocol of nmea next the device started having problems with with the blue tooth connection the blue light would never turn on i would have to turn the device on and off about 50 times before the magic blue light would turn on and then sometimes it would only turn on constant and not blink i could bypass about 40 times turning it on and off by bouncing the device off my steering wheel this is a ridiculous thing to have to do to get it to work i emailed tech support and tried to call them all to no response now it is the most finicky device i have ever had i am often tempted to throw this piece of junk out the window and be done with it i must strongly recommend you stay away from this device and probably hollux all together now i will have to buy another gps
i bought this tv oct as a refurb from act 2 mos later have n't watched it yet it arrived broken turns on off continually act totally uninterested only sharp warranty repair austin is et television which got lowest possible rating on austin city search i could n't agree more in shop for 1 month got it home still broken sharp customer service has been a nightmare no response people on phone keep saying they are sorry nothing they can do
i bought a sharp lcd tv from j r in new york last jan after a year and half when powering on the tv sometimes works sometimes not after unplug in wait for a while and plug back worked for a couple months send it to service center to checkup was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced when request to get back the replaced lcd control board was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board it has to be shipped back otherwise you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced it 's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any but if you do want to get a sharp better get a long long
once again a consumer electronics hardware maker proves that they ca n't develop a good software interface for their device in terms of physical design this is one of the best cordless phones out there the sound quality is also quite good and the dect technology works on a band that keeps it free of wifi interference however i had to return this phone right away because the interface is so awful first of all philips really shortchanged this device by putting in a cheap lcd display that can only display 8 letters on caller id and then they are letters formed in barely legible on the numerical display i mean how much more would if have cost them to put in a modern lcd display with enough pixels to show real letters but the clincher is the poor design of this phone 's caller id interface call it caller confusion if you have caller id with name service from your phone company with this phone you can only see the name and only the first 8 letters of it ! while the phone call is coming in there is no way to scroll the display to show the phone number you can only see that after the phone has stopped ringing what use is that if the incoming phone call actually has a name from the phone company this is barely ok but for the many calls that have no name this phone will show cell pho '' or unknown '' or 800 serv '' there is no way to get it to show the actual number while the phone is still ringing if you 're trying to screen calls it 's essentially useless whoever designed this interface just does n't get what caller id is for in the first place i would have loved to like this phone because i think the phones from panasonic vtech motorola and others are horribly ugly and my previous panasonic had the worst audio quality imagnable but this phone does n't cut it as well why is the cordless phone market so devoid of good products
i bought this phone because i need my hands free as i roam around the building small church i did much research on the web and in consumer reports to find a good portable phone an answering machine for a good price uniden is pretty good but it seems digital tech in phones just is n't perfected yet at least for the shoppers the clarity was ok some people still told me that i sounded like i was in a closet when speaking to them i use an piece so that may be the problem not the phone one thing is clear though it cut out when i went to our lower floor towards the two ends of the building major static and the phone could n't connect even after trying the connection again my old radioshack 900 mhz worked fine so i returned this went back to uniden products bought a from them went downstairs with it same problem looks like i 'll be returning that too oh yeah do n't get a phones if you plan on talking while your microwave is going it will most likely interfere with your 2.4 phone and the phone will only work if your about 50 or more feet from the microwave while it 's operating i 'm back to my it may feel like a brick but it takes the calls even outside in the parking lot ! sorry uniden
after a couple of exchanges with manufacturer 's tech support card was determined to be defective replaced by retailer with 5 port version which was in stock card continues to work fine
i did n't give it a one because it started out i have a compaq presario with the integrated intel 817 video chipset i purchased the ali usb 2 pci to usb card to use with an external usb hard drive i inserted the card into an open slot and everything went pretty smooth the card worked wonderfully with the then i bought a ipod this is where my previously considered card went south i plugged it into the card and everything froze i tried every conceived configuration but to no avail then i also learned my odessa 12 '' pressure pad my compaq usb keyboard or even a usb logitech mouse wo n't even work with it the rule of thumb is your usb devices will work as fast as the slowest link in the chain but it should work the ipod works if i plug it into one of my integrated onboard usb 1.1 slots albeit sans the transfer speed of usb 2 frustrated i did some research and found the chipset the ali card uses to be incompatible with many usb devices what 's the point of that lesson learned if you 're going to buy an inexpensive card and want to take the chance it will work for you then go ahead but the nec chipset is the way to go for compatibility i hope this helps someone
i wanted the home antenna system so i could bring my receiver out of my vehicle and listen to it in the house too i set up the antenna in a south facing window as per the instructions but soon discovered that this was unnecessary as the high gain antenna picked up the signal right through the roof with no visible or audible degradation of the signal now it sits unobtrusively on top of my stereo cabinet obviating the need to route the lead wire through the house to the window great ! commercial radio with all your annoying commercials and mindless yapping moronic djs
i bought this one for my wife specifically because i did n't think she 'd use it enough to merit an ipod i may have wasted my money how hard would it have been to add even the most basic a folder on the disk equals a new playlist '' level of management or files since she listens in the van with the kids i wanted a way to put both her music and the kids on it altogether but still keep track of whose is whose and the plastic scroll wheel in the upper corner forget it you need two hands to use this thing since you ca n't reach the buttons the menu and the scroll wheel in the combination that you need i will give it points for just being a simple usb flash drive and not making me run special software that helps and the expansion card is nice but honestly i would have been better off with a nano
sound quality is good but i really do n't like the style it is smaller than you 'd expect it to be because the image shown is not the actual size of the player the reaction time between when you press the buttons and the display on the screen is ehh a bit slow i 'd say i just always happen to pass the song i 'd much rather buy an ipod but have heard it is not the most reliable thing ever but i know for a fact that ipods are very quick unlike this player i 'm shopping for a new player around 50 but have found no luck in getting a sleek styled and reliable one i guess i 'll just have to wait for the prices of the ipods to lower i do not trust ipods or any electronic items you never know how the previous owner treated the item before selling it online also this player has only two colors really silver and white the earphones gave too much of a loud surround sound which i really disliked so i used the earphones from my previous sandisk player okay so maybe this player does n't really have that many problems but these are just my preferences and i just do n't like the overall appearance of it many of my friends have ipods and they work well no problems yet so i guess they 're pretty reliable also the battery on the goes quickly if you are going on a long trip i suggest you have an extra one or two batteries with you i constantly have to check to see how much battery life is left on my display screen i really do not recommend buying this player if you are a teen like me because you will regret it i have found the style of this to be extremely unappealing a while after i bought it as time went on i started to dislike it more and more as soon as the prices of ipods lower i 'm definitely buying one i like many teens look for mostly a sleek style that ipods offer and of course reliablility after all it can be very fustrating time after time of having to buy a new player because of how unreliable it is
i got this product a while ago it would work then it 'd stop then i 'd reinstall everything it 'd worok again but soon it would stop working all over again it seems that i can get it to work whenever i want provided i completely reinstall the software whenever i need to reboot my pc so it sits there unused it 's a piece of junk
very frustrating experience and i am returning to amazon their return policy is the good news after a lengthy set up process i thought i had the thing running but 1 to switch from linksys to computer speakers or my hardwired system you always have to exit out of media player and restart it despite the lynksys software telling you you 're disconnected 2 to get back to the linksys i find you always have to restart lynksys as well as media player and then it only works a quarter of the time 3 rebooting the computer works sometimes to get it hooked up and other times after multiple reboots of everything i just give up and listen to the note book speakers this might seem ok if i could just leave it connected but it 's would n't be because 5 the thing starts acting up and dropping out the music whenever i leave it running for more than an hour or so i have no idea why in short a great idea but until it works it 's useless i suspect most problems are software related i am running a centrino computer with windows xp sp 2 on a wireless g network where internet and print server work just fine note that the lynksis does not support mac at all
this music bridge is obviously a product that should not be in the market i spent at least 10 hours in three different chat and phone sessions with technical support until they asked me to return the unit got a used unit in exchange after upgrading firmware in the router and downloading the utility from their web site to replace the one in the cd and three more sessions with the tech people my pc can finally ping the bridge and every now and then the utility can even find it no way to play music through the bridge though tried changing wmp speaker settings turning firewall off uninstalling and installing the utility everything i or tech support can think of also when the bridge is powered my network becomes unstable and the pc 's connectivity goes on and off i have linksys router and phone adapter but if i had done a google search before buying i would surely had gone for a different product such is the number of negative comments i 've found afterwards
unlike many reviewers i had no real issue with the installation process i have installed many linksys products on my wireless network and a few minutes of reading on the linksys community forum revealed a good user install tutorial that worked just fine i was up and running in minutes the problem is that the quality of sound coming from the music bridge blows ! i had the unit sitting less than 30 feet from my router and was experiencing a large number of not to mention the fact that the music sounded like it was coming from under water i know i have the most recent firmware etc many user forum comments indicate that one problem is network traffic hello ! ! if this product can not work while my home network has other traffic then what good is it i am not even going to bother with further trouble shooting i wanted to give this unit a try because it was cheap and i have all linksys gear already i have been down this path with other linksys products and typically if their product does not work out of the box then no amount of tweaking will really solve the problem i am going to return this unit and go with one of the logitech wireless solutions which use a direct wireless connection not through your home network and have better reviews
it 's a great idea poorly executed i 've set up lots of wireless networks and devices i know what i 'm doing and i 'm telling you that the music bridge is not ready for mass consumption you can follow the directions on the cd over and over and it will complete and tell you that you 've successfully configured the bridge and then nothing it does n't connect to your wireless network try it again success ! then no connection reconfigure your dhcp and your router and your modem reset everything to factory defaults turn off all firewalls nothing works so rtfm and find out it is written by an esl oeming hardware is expected oeming documentation is a mistake i expect better from other reviewers have said they 've got it working after 10 hours of putzing i 've got better things to do with my free time i hope you do too skip the music bridge follow up ok so i did find 3 hours this morning to work with the google told me that lots of people have the same problem with this unit before you buy it google ip '' this device reminds me of when i worked for a computer company that i 'll call gatebay 2000. as the company began to really fail they started branding any piece of crud they could find just to make the sell the new products group had already been laid off my point is that maybe linksys is having trouble and they ca n't take the time for qa i am returning my today and i 'll try something else and lastly my call to the '' linksys support line left me on hold for forty four minutes obviously hangtime is not one of their cs metrics
this is my first review and i am writing it because i am compelled to let others know that this is not a good product i spent at least 10 hours trying to configure the device and at least one of those hours was spent on the phone with linksys i have experience with networking and quite simply this device does not work as intended i was able to get it to work for periods of time but it stops after 5 minutes or so or i have to reconnect do n't waist your time or money on this
it is likely if you are looking at an access point rather than a basic broadband router that you are wanting more versatility in your wireless setup if this is the case this product is a waste of time despite being advertised as an access point ap the is not a true ap there is no client ap mode allows the ap to be a client to another ap there is no wireless bridge mode there is no wireless repeater mode in fact everything you would expect to see on an ap is missing and do not seem to be able to keep track of firmware releases properly either my ap came with 1.03 which according to does not exist as such it 's virtually useless as anything other than a very basic access point buy the linksys instead and get a real ap
the url that says you should go to in order to access the 's configuration system does n't load which means you can not configure the unit to make a unique name set up security or have it work as an extendor to an existing system i 've tried loading the setup wizard from several isps so that 's not the problem i 've tried calling phone support remaining on the phone in one instance for over 90 minutes and have n't spoken to anyone i 've emailed their tech support several times and have yet to receive a reply not even an automated we got your email expect a response '' their online help site does n't do anything other than point you at the same url that does n't work so i 've spent 70 bucks on a thing i ca n't use i 'll never use products again
i agree with most of the reviews regarding the difficulting in installing this wireless access point i am no it expert but have quite a bit of experience in installing and administering networking equipment in a large corporate environment i was able to get a connection without any encryption but could not get the device to work with wep or wpa i eventually had our it consultant configure the device but it took him about four hours he had previously recommended that i go with linksys but i did n't listen i regret that decision
it stopped working 2 weeks after i got it the display goes back and forth between ok to disconnect and playlist buttons for search and the toggles do n't function either it is a great idea poor product
received had a button broken did work but right arrow would not click replacement did not transmit the bass i almost bought a new stereo system for my car thinking my speakers were bad but tested the product in 5 other cars and had the same problems i do not recommend this product me and all my family have the previous version with manual setting that one is excellent and i will probably buy me one more of those
the auto scan feature invariably stops on a band with interference while i have no problem finding one manually the sound quality is disappointing and yes i have a decent stereo in the vehicle it sounds almost muffled i still much prefer playing a cd this is the second monster transmitter that i have found disappointing it may be that all fm transmitters suffer from poor sound quality but a few years ago in a previous vehicle the cd player that transmitted in this manner had no such problems very disappointing for the money
i bought this at compusa i live in rural vermont the autosearch works fairly well the static when connected is acceptable a big problem is that suddenly you 'll get blasted by static when the fm signal is interfered with i 'm bringing it back for refund i agree with the previous reviewer it 's not worth it my wife 's old 8 station monster works much better i 'm going to try going back to my old belkin charge which connects to a cassette
i bought one of these from circuit city for 99 i live in area the auto station find was not very effective i found clearer ones by manually searching when it 's connected to your ipod it definetly slows down the menus the buttons on the icarplay 200 are also very unresponsive i would press the change station button nothing happened then press it again then it would jump twice so my advice is have patience when navigating the icarplay 's menus sometimes i could get it to work with an acceptable amount of static but then the unit would randomly stop working and i get blasted with noise from my radio being cranked up you can not adjust the volume on the icarplay only on your radio i returned the unit and i am in the process of getting a pioneer head unit with a built in auxillery input on the front panel i can not recommend this unit it also looks cheap for the price point it looks like it should cost about 25 dollars one postive note it does charge the ipod fairly quickly also in my wifes car where she a factory stereo the static was n't quite as annoying i have amplified tweeters which pick up everything including static i also thought that putting the unit closer to the stereo would improve the sound oddly it does n't seem to make a difference you could also look at one of the wired ipod adapters such as the pioneer ipod adapter
the child proof tray lock feature is an absolute nightmare there is software issue with this player this feature was activated by itself and would n't unlock following the procedure in the manual sony support is totally useless they recommended steps that i have already tried the support person was obviously reading from a template as it took him probably doing support from india 10 minutes to respond to every simple question after struggling for 1 hour he finally concluded that the unit needs to be sent back the player is only accepted at sony 's texas service location sony does n't provide service locally even though there are tons of sony stores in my area not only i have to pay shipping out of my own pocket the turn around time will be about a month worst yet the fine print in the support agreement says sony will ship me back another refurbished unit i will think twice before buying sony again
the sound on the sennheiser phone changes a lot sometimes the music is loud and sometimes low the volume knob is not that good the only good thing is that it partially stays in your ear i cut off one piece because the two different cord lengths were annoying
i spent two days and could n't get the wireless to work with the camera configured using wired ethernet cable the unit worked fine picture quality is poor and does n't work in low light i used two infrared light sources and the camera does n't pick up a picture ptz is kind of cool but it does n't provide any value if you ca n't get a decent picture
the concept is nice camera however there are some fundamental flaws with the design the streaming of the video is too for the a simple ping shows hops in excess of as soon as i stop streaming it is about which means the cams processor is overloaded the stream is very choppy as for pan tilt only works 25 of the time the video always streams which means there is connectivity but when i issue commands only 25 of the time does it respond to my commands i bought this as a toy to put in the front window to see who is there while i am working in my home office i do n't see how someone would could use this for practical monitoring the picture is very choppy not very clear and does n't respond to commands considering linksys is owned by cisco this hit the market without any real quality assurance this is hardly useable 2 thumbs down come'on cisco get your act together you are leaving room for someone to come in and do it better i will be returning this and may buy the panasonic
it works but if you take it far from wireless router forget it if you are buying for overseas do n't even waste your time i wasted a week to show it to my relatives overseas
i installed this camera and worked fine i took it downstairs for wireless it is so slow you can take a nap if you trying to use to see video from work overseas or from another wireless computer forget about it it does not work even i enabled port on camera and opened the ports on wireless it worked as long as it was sitting next to wireless router if you take if far from wireless router it does not work i returned it and using my logitech quickcam wired
when my sony lcd monitor died i had to replace it this acer looked great in the store but it was too loud in there to hear that the speakers are terrible tinny and not nearly loud enough and the whole unit emits a nasty buzzing noise that is driving me crazy i 'm not sure if it 's due to this acer 's speakers or what but the sony was almost completely silent in comparison i will be returning this and getting something else
i bought this product to took my ipod up to my laptop which only has usb input and not firewire it worked but as soon as i placed the ipod down on my desk at a certain angle the computer would stop recognizing it it only worked when i held the ipod upright with my hand i had to send it back this may have been a defect but who knows if anyone else has had simmilar problems kindly notify me
i visited ireland from the and my hair dryer sparked when i used the adapter and fried both of them also i had a convertor for my ipod but was unable then to use the adapter the usb charger never worked oh well live and learn
i 've tried two of these travel chargers it 's a nice idea i have some devices that can be by usb so for my trip overseas i wanted to just bring one of these adapters and the device 's usb cables to save space but the usb adapter caps did not charge my cell phone motorola or pda palm tx so i 'll still have to bring the full wall adapters if the ac adapter cap converted voltage it would be great but it does n't if you could plug the ac adapter cap onto one end and the usb adapter cap on the other you could have a nice compact unit for travel of course if the usb adapter cap does n't work what 's the point it 's still useful for its travel adapter cpabilities but i am disappointed that it would n't charge any of my usb devices
i have waited until i finally received a working model to post my experience with logitech first let me begin by saying that now that i have a working audio station i really do love it the product deserves the excellent ilounge review it received the sound is great it has an audio in port and an out port on the back i can not for the life of me understand why there are 300 units made by apple and bose that are nothing more than some speakers additionally the tuner works well i really only use the fm tuner but have found it to be good better than i expected but not perfect however once again most units at this price point do not have any sort of tuner and that was a sacrifice i was not willing to make for all of these reasons i really do like the audio station however if there was even another product on the market with these characteristics out audio in i would have taken my business elsewhere in a second my experience with logitech was terrible first i brought home a unit from best buy in early february and found that it was one of a bad batch that went out to best buy stores see other reviews on this page for more details on which units have the problem with buttons not responding after the buttons on the front of the unit did n't respond i got online and read the reviews posted here on amazon as well as on logitech 's own website where they finally admitted that this was a flawed product i then contacted logitech to see about having a product sent to me as part of the warranty the representative at logitech told me i would be better off taking my unit back to best buy i realized that i knew more about the problem with the audio station than the customer service rep did after only about 20 minutes of poking around online i told him that apparantly a bad batch went out to best buy stores and the last thing i was going to do was to waste my time returning a product to best buy only to bring another faulty unit back home i also told him that i 'd read that audio stations coming directly from the factory were reportedly working fine and i wanted one of those after some time on the phone we arranged for my unit to be picked up and then i would receive a new unit in 10 days 10 days later i called this was the first time i found out that the unit was out of stock and my order was on backorder i was furious that i had to call to find out the item was on backorder not only was this the first i heard of the problem but there was nothing they could do for me i was told the first week of march they would recieve some in the warehouse i waited about 8 days into march i called again the order had n't made it to the warehouse a small order was due to arrive but it was not guaranteed that i would get one of them again i was very displeased but there was nothing i could do this was the first time that a customer representative seemed to know what he was talking about and actually served as an advocate for me to their credit i did recieve a unit out of that first batch it arrived relatively quickly and works fine however it was a terrible terrible experience along the way if you buy one of these i guarantee buying directly from the factory logitech does not seem inclined to recall their bad units and appears to be content with letting customers deal with their problem if you do buy from best buy or from amazon be careful you may receive one of the flawed units and who knows how long it will take a replacement to get to you it basically took logitech 7 weeks to get me a new model i 've never had so much trouble giving a company 300 of my money i plan to never shop with logitech again
received this as a gift the reviews were excellent on ilounge and it looks pretty slick however as many others have noted the volume controls did not work returned it to amazon who replaced it extremely promptly replacement unit had same problem returned it to logitech as advised was promised a fixed unit within a couple of weeks that was more than six weeks ago am advised that all units are now on backorder asked for a refund and was advised that that will take a long time also i will never buy another product from logitech in my life on the other hand amazon customer service was excellent
similiar to the other reviews the control panel on the face does not work both the up and down volume controls actually lower the volume also the source '' button does not work so you can not any fm stations also the select button only works occassionally i have never ever had so many problems with an electronic piece of equipment such a waste of time and effort to buy this bring it to my office and now to have to bring it back home and then return it save your self the effort sound is great but so what if nothing else works disappointing
i do not recommend this product i recieved my first audiostation and the touch sensitive controls on the face of the unit did not work both the volume up volume down and source buttons turned the volume down the power did not work at all it played my ipod gen but could n't control it and despite reading a review about the large power convertor it was shockingly big others call it a brick for a reason ! i did n't know where to hide it i gave logitech another chance returned the unit for a replacement i was astonished to find that the second unit had the exact same problem i was looking for a system this did not live up to expectations when the logitech played it sounded good but i lost confidence and ended up purchasing a klipsch ifi 5 pc system manufacturers refurbished price and now know what great sound is as always amazon is the best hassle free shopping and returning even though this product was not great i do not fault amazon for it they made the process as easy as it could have been
as expected the audiostation sounds very good however there are some functional problems that ruin the experience on the unit both volume controls turn down the sound level every time the ipod is turned on while in the audiostation it defaults to shuffle mode regardless of how you left it the power supply brick was unexpected i hate them and it 's too loose fitting the plug falls out with the slightest nudge i have no idea how this product made it through the quality control department ! ! ! shame on logitech drop this failure and start over
i wanted to add my 2 cents excellent sound but controlls are very flawed i really loved the sound in the store i bought audiostation for a present my wife opened it and just like someone else said we could n't get past the language selection step remote not working either after about 30 mins of poking our fingers into the select '' button audiostation miraculously accepted the language setting and started playing the ipod but to my dismay both up and down volume buttons reduced volume ! in no time we had the volume all the way down and could n't get it up ! we could n't figure out how to hear the music luckily i discovered that now the remote was working why i do n't know and audiostation was responding correctly to the volume buttons on the remote in sum even though we can play music audiostation made a pretty bad impression one more thing audiostation comes with a large power supply unit i was really disappointed with that because i wanted a slick unobtrusive sound machine in our living room but where am i going to put the power brick i 'm going to return the product and get my wife something else
iv tried these earbuds multiple times hoping they 'd work everytime i put them in my ears they fall out theyre useless waste of my money
after purchasing these earbuds for a bargain price a few days ago i was ecstatic with the initial quality i heard from the tracks i was playing on my zen but for all the package 's hype including a tag proclaiming some kind of award the earbuds had won in 2004 the philips surround sound earbuds are n't all they 're cracked up to be after the somewhat promising initial tests it took me only a couple more uses to realize that the eq and frequency response on these puppies was way out of whack to say the least the product specs on the package claimed the earbuds to have a maximum frequency of which is interesting considering the human ear can only hear to just below that level so theoretically these earbuds can deliver any and all sound the media dishes out right not only did i notice significant attenuation on the higher frequencies when the volume of my zen was turned up barely past the halfway mark but also a complete domineering of the sounds in whatever media happened to be playing just try playing some ambient music with these things to get an idea of the frustration i felt trying to enjoy some relaxing vibes amidst all the jarring distortion and ringing i was hearing there does n't seem to be a feasible solution to this either as the earbuds seemed completely oblivious to my efforts of adjusting the eq output on my player additionally the assymetrical cord design seems a bit of a silly concept considering the undue amount of pull and tug it places on the left earbud causing it to fall out a little too easily ranting aside though those of you seeking out something better than the stock earbuds your portable music player has provided you with should probably keep searching
i have a netgear router and this wireless usb adapter i used the router for several months just as a firewall directly hooked into my computer and never had any problems a few days ago however i moved my computer and decided to use this usb card and have had nothing but problems since half the time on start up my computer will not be connected so i have to reboot sometimes multiple reboots and then it still does n't work and i have to unhook everything router cable modem etc i do n't know how or why this happens but it seems to make everything stuck and nothing can communicate again until i do this this has happened several times so i am not imagining this i try various things but ultimately i have to shut everything down and actually unplug the modem from the power source for a few seconds then start everything back up i have cable and this is a procedure they have you do sometimes if things get locked up usually when you have a bad connection i did n't have to do this when it was just hooked into the router but with this usb i am doing it every day sometimes several times a day then it shows a connection of like 55 and the router is in the very next room that is with the door open not 20 feet away even now as i sit here writing this the little computer on the task bar showing my connection has dropped to yellow at least it has n't changed red just did not kidding ! okay back on line this is an absolute which i would take back except i got it in a package deal with the router and i bought it a long time ago but never used it till now when it does work it is quick but when is the key word there do yourself a favor buy something else ! do n't corporations test this crap before they mass market it !
it works sometimes but most the time it ca n't pick up enough of a signal to work
perhaps i am luckier my netgear adapter crapped out '' five times in the first two weeks after reading all these negative reviews i decided just to take it back while i still could netgear support was spotty some reps really tried but i had one simply give up and walk away fromt the call
i have a very nice expensive netgear wireless access point using this adapter on to talk to it if any sort of encryption is enabled it will drop the connection once every 5 seconds i updated the firmware on the ap and downloaded newer drivers for the and it improved to only dropping once every two minutes signal strength is greater than 80 so it 's not that and i have other wireless devices much further away from the ap that work fine you would think that it would work with their own
although the software interface was n't the most sophisticated the was easy to install and worked well enough for about six months then it started dropping connections to the various networks i 'd been using and now it does n't connect at all i 've done quite a bit of troubleshooting apparently it 's fairly common for the to crap out after several months do n't buy it
i ordered this player from fingerhut and unfortunately did n't try to use it until the time to return it had expired it has never worked for me the by light comes on and stays on and that is all it does it will not play anything i tried to call the coby customer service and you never get through to anyone from what else i 've read even if you get through they will charge 31 to replace the player which is more than the 29.99 it sells for new at cvs do n't buy it unless you want to be part of the class action lawsuit i 'm contemplating filing against them
dvd player worked great for about a month after that it stopped powering up do n't buy
i ordered this dvd player so i would n't wear down my xbox by playing movies on it all the time i did n't have any of the audio problems that others have reported however after about weeks of use it just died i could n't even get it to power on if you 're looking for a cheap dvd player this will do just remember you get what you pay for
bought it played a dvd on it for 2 hours and the unit failed other dvd players in the house have had no problems at all and have worked for years save yourself time and money purchase a quality item instead of this player
i bought this item and not even three weeks later it quit working the power wo n't turn on and it completely quits on you do n't order it
i have two of these things when used with a car lighter outlet they cause my legend cx to overheat when used with a true power source they work fine most cars actually run at about 13.6 to 14 volts instead of 12. garmin is trying hard to help me resolve this but in the meantime be aware that certain units may experience problems with this system
i ordered this item from electrogalaxy through and received a 110 volt power cable i 'm not sure what it would fit electrogalaxy did not respond to my emails as to getting the right product or determining if the description is wrong instead they refunded my purchase minus the 8 it cost to ship it back to them this is their stated policy so if you ca n't trust them to send the right product do n't buy from them in short i 'm 8 in the hole with nothing to show for it other than the knowledge to not buy from this company i would recommend you email the company before purchasing this item to verify what you are getting
it definitely works and was easy to set up but my major problem was that the voice coming out was very tinny and it also was difficult to get it loud enough to properly hear over any background noise including quite typing so unless you want to sit in complete silence while using this i would recommend against
shortly after i began using my head phones i noticed the wiring at the hinges was starting to crack the wire coating within 8 months of use the left earpiece would n't work any more guess i ca n't send them back since i did n't keep the box ! also the battery pack is in an annoying place every time i turn my head it catches on something
i am a college student i bought these headphones so that i could study when the neighbors are playing loud music or when my roommates are chatting in the living room as noise canceling headphones '' they are a total disappointment there is no effect on my neighbor 's bass i can hear cars driving past my window i can hear the tv in the other room at normal and even low levels i can even hear a paper clip drop on my floor and i have carpet ! there is some muffling of outside sounds due to them covering your ears but when the active noise cancellation '' is turned on there is a pop and then some low level white noise but outside sounds are not any less audible than with it turned off these things do n't work any better than letting my hair down over my ears they work fine for listening to music the sound is good just no noise cancellation
i have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones the first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed the second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag i consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest i have ever seen even frayed bare wires were visible on one side i recommend you avoid taurus products completely
this works just fine but the picture is so small that it gave me a headache after 45 minutes of viewing not for those susceptible to migraines also it goes through batteries like a rabid raccoon goes through a dumpster mine lasted 2 hours this may only be good for kids or sports nuts who ca n't be away from their tvs
tv does not work whilst i get the picture it is in black and white and there is no voice or sound apart from hissing noise
this gadget worked fine for exactly one year and 6 months it was used nearly everyday until the on button stopped working unfortunately the warranty is only for one year i bought this when the price was inflated it should not cost more than 75 bucks for a year and a half of service ! if you want a positive review read some of the others
i bought this for my granddaughter and i have used 3 other players and this one is horrible getting 2 different computers to recognize it was impossible hello this is 2006 this stuff should just plug and play i thought i was back to dos and i am pretty computer savvy anyway save yourself and get an apple dell or phillips wow
when it worked it was really very good but after 6 months the usb cable or the cable connector in the device failed it can no longer be charged nor can files be downloaded to it i doubt if i can get it fixed under warrenty
i have had this printer for almost four years now and while it has saved my bacon on the road a number of times it has also really let me down at some crucial moments first like a lot of older canon printers it is noisy and slow it takes forever to get started on a page but also like a lot of canons when it is working right the output is beautiful but you can not count on finding ink cartridges for this printer on the road it also has a weird and unpleasant ink cartridge system which includes two very different little trays and three different kinds of tank but what made me finally leave the thing in a hotel room was its tendency to get halfway through a print job and jam or inexplicably give an error signal i have spent hours trying to get a clean copy of a single transparency very frustrating
i received the portable printer i have plugged it into many electrical outletts in my home and office the item will not turn on i was sold a broken printer i am very unhappy with this product
this item no longer comes in a traditional 3 ring binder style the current style makes it difficult to remove single pages from the middle or back of the folder just buy the refill pages and put them in a cheap 3 ring binder from your local office supply
i really need binders that can hold more discs as my collection grows and as so many new dvd releases are multiple disc sets so i was really hyped about the release of this new binder boy was i disappointed i bought mine at a local retailer but before purchasing it i noticed that the binder came with two types of sleeves 10 each of the old design and 15 each of the new design i thought the binder was tampered with so i started to inspect at least 6 other binders and found the same allocation of sleeves in each of them so instead of potentially storing 100 discs 25 sleeves x 4 i 'm left with only 80 max at least it was accurately advertised as an binder but would n't it be better if it held 100 but the bad thing is that the dimensions of the and the sleeves are different with the sleeve being between '' to '' shorter on a given side so if you have the 2 types of sleeves interspersed in your binder you may easily miss some of your discs stored in the shorter sleeves when you flip through it i bought the binder anyways it was n't until i started using the binder at home that i found really bad things about the new sleeves that just totally irritated me the openings for you to insert the discs are so minimally cut out that the only way you can take a disc out of the sleeve is to grab the disc with your fingers causing fingerprints and possibly even scratches on the surface to make matters worse the sleeves have notches in them that i am guessing were designed to hold the disc in place so that the disc does n't fly out while you flip through the binder but these notches hold the disc so tightly that they make you have to grab the disc even harder to remove it from the sleeve the old sleeves though not perfect were designed much better because the cutouts were large enough for you to stick your forefinger into the disc 's hole and slip the disc out by its edges my only option now is to hope the current case logic designers are replaced with more talented and creative ones soon because my dvd collection just got bigger with the new star wars release
i agree with the previous reviewer the belt clip works fine overall however i dinged the product way more you have to remove it every time you want to turn your shuffle on or off it would be one thing if it were every time you needed to charge the shuffle or reload songs which you also have to do but this is twice every single time you want to use your shuffle which for me is 4 or 5 times a week that 's just not practical frankly i 'm surprised the manufacturer did n't consider that when they designed the belt clip and i wish i had known about it before i bought it
i bought this one because of the good reviews here and i was very very disaponted it has more bass compared with most of the other speakers of the similiar size but the problem is that the music is twisted in order to empasize bass sounding like from a can i returned it and bought a klipsch promedia 2.0 and there is simly no comparison ! it 's not fair to reqire this kind of tiny speakers to perform but the bose 's problem is to use a price tag to impress the buyers in stead of focusing on quality i believe some of the reviewers here are just new to home audio i still remember how i was excited when upgrading my oem dell speakers to a 3.1 system for the first time well if you do not believe me just buy a pair of klipsch promedio 2.0 and see for yourself if bose worths even 50
i could use this product as the dvi plug did not fit on the dvi outlet of my computer avoid ! !
i 've always had issues with this product since i bought it on amazon i 've updated the firmwares for both the router and the card but the problems persist the problems are inconsistent internet connection its easy to isolate since i can connect my workstation directly to the and when i do my connection is normal i 've since travelled a lot and did n't have time to give this back be warned
wireless connection is disconnected frequently you can not play starcraft with other people sucks
read the reviews ordered the deal got burned the card is garbage drops in and out the router drops in and out then fried a fews days later back to linkysys for now
this adapter does not fit the latest model of the xm roady the one they were sending with the december promotion the voltage is wrong needed supplied and the power connector fortunately does not fit
you have to be suspicious when a manufacturer blames you when their product fails to perform such is the case with the skipdoctor i used this product on 6 discs 2 of which became unreadable after cleaning they worked before i cleaned them that is a pretty rotten percentage if you ask me i contacted tech support and was told repeatedly that i was doing it incorrectly so i decided to try my own route at fixing the 2 bad discs i used auto rubbing compound it made the discs shine like glass and most importantly they work again a 5 bottle will clean about 500 discs you do the math all my discs look like new and are working just fine now skip the doctor !
i tried this product on two dvds that would no longer play reliably the scratches were minor and only in one part of each disc after liberally spraying the lubricant '' and running each through the machine twice then buffing just as the directions suggest neither disc would load in the dvd player at all i will be returning this product immediately and will advise anyone i can to avoid it
i bought this for my son who has had a few scratches on some of his games he followed the directions and the game doctor put a perfectly circular scratch all the way around the ruining it kids being kids did n't give up and tried another disc again completely ruining the the kind of scratch this will not get out ps the resurfacing fluid '' is primarily distilled saline try that first with some muscle behind a soft cloth you have a better chance saving your games ! customer service is hopeless i would warn anyone to not buy this product perhaps i got a bum machine but digital innovations will do nothing to rectify the situation i had to leave a star the system would n't let me leave zero
it does n't make discs worse and it does n't fix every possible scratch some people here think it 'll fix severely damaged discs it is intended only for reasonable damage however i spent 49 for the motorized version at best buy it worked and i 'd give it about 9 out of 10 rating scale on fixing the library 's badly scratched discs but a year later maybe less ! it appears as if the internal gears are stripped apparently the gears inside are plastic and do n't last long there 's not much choice on cd scratch repair machines to choose from i am forced to have to buy the manual version now or go back to what i was using before a buffing wheel and car finish buffing compound
the good news is that the motorized skipdoctor is easy to use unfortunately the bad news is that it does n't work i tried to repair two disks parts of which had become unplayable after the process both disks appeared to be badly scratched again the good news is that the process did n't make either disk play any worse but it also did n't fix either disk 's problems save your money
i purchased this player thinking it was a good purchase boy was i wrong creative labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware software or other products like this one now having problems with the product is one thing but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats also when i ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned after i purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month my player stopped working after 3 months i did get it to work again two months later the screen told me i had hardware problems ok so i download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go oh and i forgot to mention that i am working in eastern europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone save yourself some frustration and get something better iriver maybe just stay away from creative lab products
i bought this player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a 200 dollar player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service do n't count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product
this is my second pronto neo the first one was refurbished and lasted four months while the second one lasted a little over a year would you like to know what philips told me they told me tough luck buddy please buy another one of these thing so we can rip you off again of course i am kidding about what they said but they would not fix either of them because they were out of warranty i will never buy another one of these things again i am done getting ripped off ! do n't make the same mistake i did twice !
i had been told this was an excellent product so i was very excited to receive it however when i got the item i was very disappointed in the quality it feels light and cheap buttons stick often requiring presses to work the learning '' function says it captures a code but when you attempt to use it it does n't work despite the claims of philips that it can learn any remote it wo n't i tried to revert '' the remote back to factory settings as directed by philips service department but it would n't reset all in all spent 2 days trying to program and 1 hours on the phone with tech support
the bummer about this software and other reviewers tend to agree is it 's so buggy installation and configuration are easy but diagnosing connection problems is a nightmare this is especially true when trying to connect to another netgear vpn router which seems almost like an exercise in futility seeing that their software has n't been updated in over 3 years points out netgear itself is n't even behind this product anymore buyer beware this software also conflicts with cisco 's vpn software a much better more reliable product i needed both cisco and netgear 's clients on the same machine which does not appear to be possible as the netgear software conflicts with cisco 's operation uninstalling the netgear software and cisco 's netgear 's software broke the cisco client enabled me to connect once again with the cisco vpns i often use the lack of a printed manual is also a downer for this product i ended up returning my netgear vpn firewall 25 as well it was very buggy and randomly went down what a piece of junk my netgear prosafe 318 vpn firewall is very good but unfortunately their vpn software is unreliable quirky and seemingly unsupported
i purchased several copies of this product they were intended to connect remote employees to netgear 's router needless to say it was extremely difficult and time consuming to setup and i consider myself highly competent in network setup and configuration supports dynamic dns services but the client software or documentation says nothing of such setup in fact it is full of typos and inconsistencies by secondguessing the online posted manual for make sure you get the latest one and using my experience i was able to connect to the then we upgraded the mcafee viruscan from 7.0 to client computers winxp or started to crash to blue screen of death bsod clean installs and reinstalls in various order did not hel either mcafee has this bug in their knowledgebase and said that the safenet softremote software oemed by netgear as prosafe vpn client release 10.1 had this issue but was corrected in release netgear does not even want to provide an update to this and is still under release for 2.5 years so either buy safenet softremote or do not relly on mcafee hince the 2 star
the retractable mechanism works well and the cable is compact but this cable is pretty much useless as a travel cable first of all it 's too short in about half of the hotels where i needed to use it the network jack was at least a couple of feet further away than the reach of this cable second and more importantly it 's not robust enough after a year or so of light use a wire inside got broken somehow and today i had to go in search of a regular cable on the outside there seems to be no damage to the wire in short it 's one of those purchases that i regret enough to write a negative review
i brought the in november 2006 after having my magellan stolen from my car it barely last a month from day one i was on the phone with customer service i had to reset it constantly as it would freeze up in the middle of navigating on the highway it then started to reset itself constantly going on and off never completing the task of finding an address i sent it in for repair and they sent me back the same unit with no repair and all the maps removed finally i just had to return to amazon i have lost my faith in magellan and going over to garmin i bought the yesterday and saw far it works right out the box the navigation is spot on although it does not say the street names the directions are very clear and accurate i can put it inside my window sill in my apartment and get a signal the took forever and indoors even by the window could not get a signal while i did like the photo veiwer and neither one was worth writing home about the was tinny and with a cassette adapter played with such static on my stereo it just was not worth it the pictures were okay but the screen is tiny and fuzzy both features would have been passable if the device performed its main task but it didn't
here 's the thing it 's not like you magically hook up your device to this and it charges from the sun you use the solar panels to charge a battery which then charges your device so you need to have this thing in the sun all the time to keep the battery charged and then it will take forever to charge whatever device you have as if that 's not bad enough it comes with 1.5 million pieces so it 's not exactly as portable as you 'd hope if you read the instructions the manufacturer is clearly trying to sell this based on some environmental claims you wo n't be using electricity to charge your ipod but your ipod will take forever to charge you have to carry around the little array the battery and whatever adapters you might need clearly there 's a better way to save energy keep your fridge slightly warmer or adjust your thermostat this is a waste of time
it 's no wonder the product description was so sparse what i got was a small piece of thin plastic the size of the screen and a piece of scotch tape stuck to it i guess i was supposed to tape this plastic er the screen protector onto the screen but there was n't even enough tape to keep the plastic on ! this is the biggest waste of 18 i 've ever spent there are better cheaper products out there that are actually worth the money
have a zen vision m and this thing does not fit it is about too wide and 2 mm too tall to fit on the screen it does not tuck into or slip under the plastic around the screen either go figure
like so many others i found that the unit fails quickly the original failed after 4 months the replacement lasted only long enough to get beyond the warranty period
i purchased a about 18 months ago the first unit i purchased failed after a few months netgear replaced it because it was under warranty the replacement unit worked nicely for about 15 months then it failed too with pretty much the same symptoms the unit only has a one year warranty so netgear told me i would have to buy another i 'm not going to do that because the units do n't seem to last and i do n't want to have to buy another one every 18 months or so i 've seen a number of reviews on various sites by other customers who have had the same experience be warned
this thing was a major hassle from the start difficult to set up even for an experienced computer user like me once it was set up it took about 5 minutes to get an ip address every time i connected to it for the savvy that means i would turn on my computer connect to the network then wait 5 minutes to be able to go online even though i was laready fully connected to the device that level of terrible performance is simply unacceptable then about 4 months after i bought it it up and broke do n't waste your money on this terrible terrible piece of equipment
i could n't get this product to work with my existing equipment the netgear extender had a default ip address of linksys routers serve ip addresses in the range i could n't get beyond this incompatibility my search of the internet for a solution only found more people reporting the same problem i finally returned the netgear extender for an equivalent linksys product which i had no problem getting to work
my began to fail roughly around the end of the one year warranty when it did finally fail due to manufacturing defects 33 days after the warranty had expired netgear would not stand behind their product in any way unless you 're into buying 100 disposable networking gear avoid this product
item defective and seemed to be the metal antenna seemed to be hand bent back to shape after damage unit did not power on
this unit is not a magic '' hd antenna it 's a regular horizontal rabbit ears design which works ok if you live in the city or close to the broadcasting station it does not pick up any good quality viewable signal if you 're living in suburbs think twice before buying this product pau
i have found that this cable does not fit snugly to maintain a good connection it tends to wiggle part of the way out rather easily the zip cord function is disappointing it worked for a little while but it did n't take long for it not to function properly after only a few uses it does n't roll all the way back up nor does it want to stay unrolled most of the time
okay it 's late and i 'm crabby after wrestling with a wireless network for most of the day i bought this bad boy to strengthen the signal for my network a few really points first as several other reviewers have pointed out apparently you can hook this thing up to your router not that the directions tell you that though the directions only show connecting to a pc how silly of me to think i could follow the directions i popped over to my local microcenter and bought a linksys pci card and this i 'll usually try and stay with the same brand but microcenter had neither a linksys signal booster or a hawking pci adapter if indeed either company makes such a beastie i got home from the store slapped the linksys pci adapter in fired up the computer and went to connect the things were going too smoothly as soon as i unscrewed the antenna from the pci adapter the signal disappeared which is to be expected i then connected the and still nothing rebooted still nothing checked hawking 's website no user forums no nothing checked amazon thinking that i might get some good tech advice the reviews say you can put it on the router what a concept ! i unscrew the antenna on the router a linksys only to discover that the connector does n't fit argh i call the tech support from the back of the manual wrong search the web find the right i call and after a fairly short wait a pleasant surprise ! i get a guy from india no surprise there i can usually understand these guys but the connection was horrific had to start phonetically spelling everything like a wwii fighter pilot kilo bravo whiskey foxtrot '' anyway the tech support guy right away starts talking me through the router end of things i told him that i was following the directions i 'm goofy that way and trying to connect to a pci card after a short stint on hold tekkie informs me that the is incompatible with the linksys pci adapter this despite the package that says also works with other certified wireless network adapters and devices with removable antennas '' except that it does n't so tekkie then suggests i try to hook up the to the router end of things at which point i inform him that the connectors are incompatible another short moment on hold and he comes back and tells me that i need a hacst coupler to connect the to the linksys router will the be compatible with the router even though it 's not compatible with the pci adapter '' i ask tekkie assures me that it will be amazon lists a hacst coupler at about 9.00 usd n't wait to see what my local microcenter hammers me for it for installing my network i at least had the wisdom to buy locally so i could return things easier when i go and pick up the hacst it 'll be trip 4 for the network i might return the or i might pick up the hacst i 'm too tired to decide right now whichever i decide and i 'll update the saga as it unfolds this is getting one star for compatibility issues and inexcusable documentation and a user unfriendly website stay tuned ! update see my comment that follows this review for an update
this signal booster did not work for me i set it up according to the instructions connected to a dlink router when i attempted to connect to the router via laptop it would connect and then drop the connection after about 10 seconds that would repeat indefinitely i tracked the signal with a strength meter and it boosted it to the level expected but for some reason when the connection was made to the router it was dropped i sent the first unit into hawking thinking it was defective but they replaced the unit and it did exactly the same thing i have no idea why it did n't work maybe my fault i am thinking perhaps i need two of these one at the router and one at the laptop perhaps the signal going back to the router is not strong enough to keep the connection
i read the reviews and chose to believe the good ones bad choice while watching on netstumbler the product would decrease my signal strength each time i increased the power output even with different antennas antenna positions and computers got it yesterday sending it back tomorrow i guess i will move on to creating a wired access point in my attic to get the extra 15 feet of signal reach i needed but did not even come close to getting from this product
this product came lacking cables and proper documentation i have tried over 18 times via email and phone to get the proper items from the company the cust support tells me to go to tech support and they answer emails with one line and their support team is obviously foreign with a poor understanding of thier own products as well as the english language stay away from this company until they get their 'house in order
this amazing '' booster did nothing to my signal i have tried everything and nothing
when i first purchased this item i loved it there were a few times the gps led me astray but generally it really helped me get from place to place in my job it helped my find places where i did not know where they were or helped my find short cuts from place to place however soon after i got it it quit acquiring satellites '' it would try and try to find satellites even though it showed them on one of the screens most often it would never find the satellites or if it did it was about the time i arrived at my location the gps had trouble no matter what location i was in whether rural or city i sent it in for repair and from what i can tell of the paper i received when it was returned which was very vague to me they replaced it unfortunatly it is still doing the same thing it is a great data management system however and i love that it interfaces with word '' the gbs is a big disappointment it 's overpriced for what it can truly provide
i bought this unit and was excited to see how it performed it turned on and acquired the satellites within 10 minitues initially all i spent the next 4 days trying to get it to work with my computer after several emails and phone conversations garmin finally told me the deal no garmin unit is designed to work with windows xp media edition additionally their usb connection will only work if the usb chips are intel the following chips will definitely not work ali nec or via i am not happy with garmin they could have saved me a lot of grief by stating this in their advertisements or home page technical faqs
i 've been buying sony products for 30 years and i 've never been as disappointed as i am with this product of theirs besides the fact that i have yet to figure out why the speakers periodically sony says i probably need to send it back to be checked i think this receiver is overly complex and hard to use almost nothing about it except the basic controls seem to be intuitive if i could send it back for a refund i would
i have 7 hd channels and one of them is not coming in well antenna i bought this device hoping that would help that one channel it did not instead it killed all of the channels except one ! it actually hurt my reception my hd receiver rates my abc channel at 90 '' but with this amp inline it is between 40 '' and 50 '' and simply wo n't tune in most of the time the same can be said of my other channels i am going to see if i can return it after writing this review the description of this amp says it is for satellite and fm i do n't know if it helps satellite or fm but it sure does not help hd
purchased this product to improve my cable signal quality when i hooked it up the signal quality was worse than using an antenna you will be wasting your money buying this product
save your money for some real protection for your gear panamax furman i have a powerbar and during the recent storms in southern california lost my rotel av receiver to a brownout despite it being hooked up to one of these never mind the bold claims about how these glorified surge protectors will enhance your system 's sound and picture spend your money instead on protecting your investment
have still not been able to program this the way it should be confusing controls instrucitons complicated not at all like my old scanner can not find a way to check to see what frequencies are stored in the scanner would look for a diferent scanner that is more user friendly
had a small problem with my headset sent it to shure to get it replaced and shure called me to tell me that this was not a reseller and that they wo n't honor the warranty because of that be warned
the sound isolating is not as good as people rave about yes it does decrease the amount of outside sound you hear but it does n't block it entirely as many people seem to rave if you listen to something with a lot going on like the white stripes and play it a little loud then yes you can not hear outside sound but if you listen to classical spoken word alt country for example and you do not crank the volume you will still hear people talking on their cell phones the sound of the subway the on speakerphone 4 cubes away i wish i had n't spent 150 on this model and had just gone for the 70 instead plus the cord is such a pain the wear it over your ear '' style feels uncomfortable and the cord never stays over my ear and always needs attention and
i am on my second printer and still the print quality is very very poor ! ! it took at least 4 months with multiple multiple phone calls and three sets of ink cartridges for epson to finally diagnose a problem and send me another printer i have given the new printer many many chances to print out a decent picture but it just ca n't my sits just above my hp 8250 and i print out the same picture on both printers using same settings of course my 100 hp wins every time least 50 more vivid pictures and much closer to the actual colors on my calibrated monitor the only thing going for this epson is its wide format but still i have had nothing but disppoinment and poor quality from this epson
i bought the base and two handsets 2 yrs ago and one of the handset completely stopped working after 1.5 yrs after a year we replaced the rechargable battery in every handsets but one of the handsets started loosing it 's power very quickly we charge for 6 hrs and it lasted for 10 minutes and then stopped working there 's an ongoing class action lawsuit against the series kxtg and kxtc in nj and the law firm encourages every consumer regardless of state who had any problems with these models to fill out a questionaire at their website they only ask for your name email address state and comment http
my experience with this product was bad the first time that uses damage the motor i do not recommend it to anybody i lost my money with this purchase
you people are still thinking in analog terms ! the beauty of digital transmission of sound data is that the sound quality will not be partially degraded by cheap cables either the data makes it through the cable perfectly or it does n't get through at all thus data transmission failures will be very obvious if your cable does n't work you 'll hear either no sound or sound that goes off and on like someone was flicking a switch i assert that anyone who reports slight improvements after purchasing a 30 cable is fooling themselves to justify their consumer folly there is no reason to pay these exorbitant prices for digital cable ! do what i do use some spare coaxial tv cable you have lying around you 'll need a screw on adapter at each end to convert the tv connector to connector these cost about 2 each at your local hardware or type outlet remember when working with a digital signal either it gets through perfectly or not at all
designed to lift money from the wallets of the american public if one is to transmit digital signals like those that come from the back of dvd and cd players reliably 100 shielding is a basic requirement this cable is not 100 shielded look for foil in addition to the copper braid further digital signals do n't care about super low resitance or impedance if the bits get there the amplitude is incidental once a sufficient level is achieved over a distance of big and fat are just to make you feel good about spending 40 on a 5 piece of hardware below for a possible exception to this thirdly if you do n't have balanced electronics what difference could an unbalanced cable with rca interconnects make rca connectors will never be connectors they will never be balanced the arrows are mostly to make you feel good about your purchase usually it simply indicates the company specs that any drains are attatched at the end to which the arrows point if you have such a grounding problem as to cause interference in your playback an rca will never cure anything as a feel good genuflection to the audiphile gods attach all your arrowed interconnects with the arrow pointing the same way and lastly look into vswr and how the design of this rca affects it the large diameter of this cable and therefore the diameter of it 's dielectric might help here but if you can see the solder job the chance of unhealthy levels of vswr is greater in that once the signal reaches this rca the differences between the rca 's shielding and other properties and the properties of the coaxial cable are sudden and definite if you have the money to spend and like to massage your cables as you install them this company makes some nice stuff not surprising in the world of audio big marketing hype over substance
i used these for 6 months when they shorted out and only one side works at a time if i wiggle it it works until the wire moves i only used them about 2 hours a week at the gym i know it 's the earpod wire i went back to the ones that came with the ipod and they work fine i 'm not happy i wasted the money
i was a user and fan of iguidance but i can not recommend iguidance until inav addresses these issues on a recent trip between boston and buffalo iguidance plotted a route that paralleled us interstate 90 instead of taking it check any roadmap to see for yourself how silly this is and no route options '' not set on local '' the route it plotted never varied no matter which of the 4 available route options were selected when i passed a highway exit it wanted me to take iguidance should have simply recalculated the route but instead it locked up my pda finally it repeatedly advised me to take illegal on the official vehicles crossovers i work in software development and i know that every application has bugs the concern comes when a manufacturer does n't want to fix them when i notified inav of this problem they repeatedly insisted that it was n't a malfunction it was just how their algorithm worked to be fair finally reluctantly inav support agreed to check their code but i will remain suspicious of any software developed by a company that claims that their algorithm is ok even when it fails so obviously in a situation
cons defect the backlight does not work shortcoming has palm os 3.1 an early version for handspring visors neutral expedited shipping time 5 days pros price ps vendor customer support contacted me and provided a replacement unit with a working backlight free of additional charge SMILE
the player was alright for a while but after like a month the display stopped showing any text and then it stopped linking up to my computer properly and when you call customer service at sandisk they are of little to no help overall i would not advise this ite
it does n't play well with my stereo system it is either too amplified or too low for the switch options under the turntable other than that it seems to be a nice turntable and seems to work fine
there was no problem with the turntable except the sound was very poor distorted and muddy i thought it had to be the cartridge and so stated in my reply to you i thought perhaps you would provide me with a new cartridge instead i was offered a 15 discount i could not tolerate the sound so that was not acceptable i have quite a collection of records 33 and 45 's some of them are in fair condition but the reproductio was very poor i have ordered several items on the net and that was the first return so i do n't think it was my problem thank you robert sander
i 've owned this for about two years now i do n't drive but i still have the same navigational issues '' that everyone else has i just wanted a convenient electronic replacement for a bulky paper map and magnetic compass the is n't the most sensitive gps i 've used by a longshot and it frequently loses lock in areas with tall buildings it also takes a long time to get initially locked up minutes this can be very frustrating at times because i keep having to find large open areas and that can be tough in a downtown area my biggest gripe is that it 's painfully slow entering addresses and street names takes forever while the lack of a real keyboard does n't help and using maps for a dense urban area sf bay area is a contributing factor the overall slowness of the unit is as least as much to blame screen redraws are excruciatingly slow as well in some cases it can take up to ten seconds to completely redraw sometimes it 's faster to just get out an paper map instead of trying to struggle with this receiver the user interface is awkward and despite having used it for two years i still have trouble remembering how to do certain things such as creating new named waypoints the unit uses multiple nested sets of menus and modes and it can be a challenge keeping track of which modes do what the magnetic compass is inaccurate each time i use the unit i have to recalibrate it and even then it seems as if it slowly drifts during use it seems to use battery power even when it 's turned off i just plan on replacing the batteries i use rechargeables each time i want to use it maybe it 's ok for rural use i ca n't say but i 'd never recommend this one for use in an urban area you 're much better off getting a paper map instead fortunately there are faster units on the market though i 'm surprised at how high the price still is on this one
first of all i returned the product because of the condition it arrived in the plastic table top was warped the bracket that adjusted its ' position was also warped very flimsy would not suggest it although it is a nice idea just not made properly
i should have read the reviews before i bought ! the table was warped right out of the box and you ca n't make the tabletop level where the notches are wo n't make it level it 's either too high or too low it is flimsy wobbles a lot and not sturdy at all we purchased at the same time another table called table max this is much better ! it has five level adjustments instead of the three tablemate has it is much sturdier too buy table max instead !
the table mate quality is much less then the commercial leads you to beleive very cheap and shakey construction the clip that holds the adjustable height broke in the first week of use you can not lean on the edge at all while eating and the top does not position flat so your plate will slide unless held do not buy this table its much easier to just take your money and toss it out the window
it worked great for a short time i had only used it about a dozen times when it started to work sporadically then a couple of days later did n't work at all it really is crap you might need to spend a little extra for a better one but that 's the best way to go
the remote works quite well and is easy to use but i 'm getting a range of feet with no barriers less with physical barriers i have n't used it much because of this
i paid about 12 shipping for this at compusa net 18 or so it 's probably worth about 10 total i get about an 8 foot line of sight range the griffin faq on this mentions two issues rf interference with 433.92 mhz devices common in home security systems and some phones and battery issues they suggest testing the range away from interference and then swapping battery i tested away from interference and got the same results then i took it apart it 's not designed to be opened and found the battery was cemented in i called tech support and got a message they were in a meeting i tried submitting an online message and got a 'server malfunction ' error from their server i 'd recommend this device for use in automobiles and motorbikes it would also work on a bike but riding a bike with impaired hearing is illegal in some states and should probably be illegal everywhere
these phones suck ! i 'm on my second set and have yet to be able to get it to connect it just sits on yellow apparently this is a common problem if you are one of the lucky few who actually got them to work yeah for you the problem is with the software used in the phones they should have gone with a simple sip config such as what 's used on linksys units but no vonage has no clue how to fix it you get nothing from vtech and even the computer geeks in the forums are at a loss they all say the same thing the software in the phones suck ! save yourself time money and aggravation and get the linksys product
i 've had vonage for a couple of years and it works great ! i live in a suburban area with great utility wiring and maintenance and we have comcast this makes a difference in how well vonage works in our old house comcast took over from jones cable and we had more problems until comcast invested in replacing old jones wiring and equipment since then it has worked great vtech broadband phone when we moved i thought i would just get this instead of altering the phone lines to use our linksis router big mistake ! this turkey did not even cluck vonage customer service did their best but nothing ever happened i returned this had vonage register my phone with my old device again got a friend to set up the phone lines to work for us and have been happy ever since if it is supposed to be easy to set up and use then a company should ensure that is the case before they send out a product marketed as easy that actually requires a membership card to the techie club to figure out
buyers beware ! i have never written or posted a consumer rating in my life i am so disappointed with vonage 's overall customer service i feel that i have no choice but to warn others vonage in its own words does not guarantee the quality of its service vonage customers will experience 1 dropped calls 2 garbled communications and 3 a and dishonest customer service department the reason vonage does not guarantee performance is because it knows that it can not my first mistake was in believing the vonage help desk during my initial 30 day money back guarantee period '' when they told me my issues were due to line quality and not vonage since then i have spent three months with vonage and my high speed internet service provider 's technicians attempting to make this service work all speed tests indicate my isp lines are fine i had a high speed internet technician visit my house last week only to tell me everything checks out all this said my vonage phone has never worked worse i made a call today and the recipient could not even discern whom i was when i finally threw in the towel and decided that vonage was not for me i was hit with a 39.99 service charge upon cancellation plus the cost of the phone despite a documented lack of performance from day one vonage 's performance is substandard by any measure closely look at all other options before bringing vonage into your life and definitely terminate all agreements within your first 14 days to avoid the inevitable early termination fees make sure you read the below clauses in vonage 's terms of service agreement before you agree to anything a vonage customer service manager mike sited these disclaimers when i told him that i was not satisfied with the service 1 '' no warranties on service '' section 4 paragraph 4 2 '' return of device '' section 2 paragraph 10 3 '' termination fee '' section 3 paragraph 6 and 4 '' money back guarantee limitations and conditions '' section 3 paragraph 7. when i switched to vonage i was simply looking for a reliable telephone service and a company that stands behind its product and supports its customers vonage 's lack of line reliability and poor customer service has motivated me to document my experience i had to call vonage customer service on my old fashion landline because the voice quality on my vonage phone was so poor that i would not be able to have a conversation after waiting for 20 minutes to talk to the service manager mike i was told that i was contractually bound because i did not terminate my agreement within the first 30 days at this moment i thought of the stereotypical shady used car transaction i was lured to buy vonage because of the promises of great service and all the free bells and whistles that only internet calling can provide '' instead i received a lemon a phone that was unreliable and a company that did not stand behind its product while vonage may get my 39.99 termination fee and the cost of the vonage phone i do not feel that i can just lay down about vonage 's failure to perform i feel compelled to 1 warn others about vonage and hopefully save them the aggravation that i have experienced and 2 hit vonage where it hurts in the economic pocket book i am terminating my service as soon as possible
was sold to me as an accessory but was n't needed because there was already one that came with the gps had to return it
why a player ca n't keep running for as long as computer dvd players is beyond me i did n't really use it all that much now that it 's past the meager 90 day warranty it will cost a 155 flat repair fee to have it fixed i am not going to waste anymore money on this player i purchased a 7 '' player for the same amount it would have taken to get this one fixed
it all began after a few hours worth of use the head began to jump and thrash inside the unit brand new player and a new dvd i called audiovox and was told that dvd was scratched or dirty i repeated that i had tried several dvds fresh out of their cases with the same results ok then the tech decided the head was dirty and i was instructed that i must buy and use a dvd head cleaner a disc that looks like a false eyelash has been glued to it i mentioned that this dvd player was brand new and nothing had been allowed to near the head in the end i bought a cleaner and the problem persisted the second call to audiovox went the same though i told them it happen when using brand new dvds the dvd must be scratched or dirty once we got past that the head was dirty though the unit was new and i had now used a head cleaner eventually this tech caved in and told me what to do to send the unit in for repair over three weeks later we received a refurbished player tossed into a box without the batteries for the headphones and the remote a quick call to the support department got me the watch battery for the remote but they forgot the headphone batteries this one seemed to work fine until the night we tried to watch return of the king halfway through whirrrr clunk clunk burp clunk whirrrr it really hates the transition point on dual layer dvds another phone call to audiovox and the same response the dvd or the head must be dirty '' i gave up as others have said the sound really is weak and tinny '' and unless you can keep your head still for an entire movie the wireless headphones are worthless plus the fact that you may be gambling on getting a junk player if you do save yourself the hassle and three week wait by taking it straight back to the store caused me to rate this player so low
despite all the bad reviews i read for various monster cable products i bought one of these cables what a mistake the rca plug flanges kept working loose shortly after purchase the first time i tried to gently squeeze them back together one broke only to reveal the cheap metal used in the connector now it 's loose all the time so i 'm replacing it with a belkin cable available right here at amazon for about the price of monster thankfully i chose other brands for all my other home theater cables digital coax optical speaker avoid all monster cables all overpriced all mediocre quality do your research you 'll see i 'm not alone
bought a subwoofer cable off ebay took it over to my friend 's house he owns this monster cable we switched back and forth between the 6 shipped and this one and guess how much of a difference the monster cable made zip zero nada thhhhhhpt ! god bless ebay and god help all the suckers who buy all the monster cable advertising hype
so in this case we definitely got what we payed for so it should n't come as a suprise it looks swell next to the tacoma on the stand but it is painful to hear we could n't get it in tune much less keep it there as far as i can tell there 's no way this will ever sound good on the other hand it works great for the four twins that play it hopefully the sound wo n't drive them away from learning that instrument
fell apart within about 5 weeks of mild use when tuning veneer cover pulled apart and splintered not worth 10
this is a toy guitar i can not say that enough it does not stay in tune my son received one as a gift from a relative a couple years ago the only thing i can say is that if you just want to see if a child would be interested in guitar then you could buy it for that reason it 's cheap enough it would certianly not be good for a child with a real interest in learning the guitar as they would be disapointed in the guitar not staying in tune and might then lose interest if your serious about a true instrument stick with the known brands and visit a music store to learn more about what would be appropriate the real ones child size can be found for around 100.00 so it 's worth it
okay your first pointer do not buy i have been plaing the guitar for 1.5 years but i will tell you i did not start out on this guitar my neighbors have one and somtimes i 'll try to tune it but it dos n't matter because they never play it the strings never stay tuned and they are horrible quality strings i own a gibson les paul epephone it is my third guiar do not even buy your child a guitar unless they are interested a way you can tell is how creative are they how often do they use thier right brain if they are interested you have to spend atleast 115 for a nice guitar my eleven year old self hopes that this helped thank you very much
i thought that maybe we had a bad experience with this because our kids are only ages 3 and 4 when they got it it sounds like other reviewers who got it for much older children had equally poor durability issues with this guitar the screws which held our tuning forks rather quickly stripped and the whole functionality of tuning the guitar was shot because the tuning bases were no longer secure we also had a string break with what seemed not extraordinary tension my kids did love playing with this guitar despite being clueless to how it actually worked it was dropped and stepped on frequently and did not lose it 's integrity to be played the tuning fork screws are miniscule and will not hold long that will quickly render the guitar playless i would definitely recommend chosing another guitar over this one you get what you pay for
i purchased this for my 9 year old son for christmas luckily i took it out and inspected it while he was n't home i took it to my piano and was going to tune it when i noticed that tuning it made the neck start coming away from the main part after twisting the middle string it broke first act includes extra strings for the two thinnest strings but not for the middle i am very disappointed and will be sending it back i 'm just glad i looked at it before christmas morning
it says on the box it fits gig gen ipods it did not fit my 60 gig i showed it to my wife who loved it and kept it for her 30. this is a beautiful case for the 30 gig ipod only ! ! ! ! ! ! ! bewar
ipod is too thick can not snap front back on
warning your ipod may already be stuck ! good luck trying to get your ipod of its case once it gets into it why you ask would you want to get your ipod out of this sleek looking case perhaps because like me you realize that the case 's thickness prevents the use of the docking station but not the cable by itself apple 's out cable which goes into the headphone jack and griffin 's italk voice recorder if you only plug headphones into your ipod then the case is great if you have any inklings of a plan to use any accessories beyond just the headphones avoid this case
i knew this cable was on the economy '' end of monster 's product line but i expected it to nevertheless be a quality product due to the monster name the cable simply does n't work because the terminals are not split '' they do not hold tight on the connections on the video component you put them on and they just slide off this was the case on both a new dvd player and a cable box so it was n't a question of the video component being out of spec monster should pull this off the market and fix the design defect
i brought this at the same time i got my ipod mini the latter 's great ! the case smells very bad a chemical smell very strong also the part that covers the screen 's scratched im not returning it because i dont have time if idid i definitely would like people already mentioned it does also bulk to the ipod and wont fit into the belt clip the screen part does attracts lints making the screen not as clease as it can be without the case
at the same time that i purchased the axion 7 '' portable dvd player for my kids i also purchased the phillips 8.5 '' portable dvd player for myself the phillips is in a different league than the axion and if you 're a traveler that will rely on the battery life of the portable dvd player then you definitely do n't want the axion the phillips is a bit more expensive but it has everything and more than you could want out of a portable dvd player both the phillips and the axion lcd screens are crystal clear you lose a little definition as you move side to side as with most lcd type screens but nothing too drastic that would warrant a complaint the phillips has an 8.5 '' screen and the axion a 7 '' screen the 1.5 '' difference is not dramatically different but the larger phillips screen does enhance the viewing experience the sound is fair on both the phillips and the axion without headphones but i do n't think that the idea was to use the units without them sound is fabulous on the phillips with a good pair of headphones and just okay on the axion your ipod headphones will do just fine for either unit and if you do n't have a pair you 'll need to buy one because the players do n't come with any both have two audio output jacks and a splitter not included worked fine on both so that 4 people could watch and listen at the same time with headphones here 's the big difference between the two units battery life i 've gotten almost 7 hours out of the phillips ' battery and the axion 's battery gives you less than 2 hours therefore if you 're an airline traveler or just want to bring your player somewhere that you ca n't use either the car adapter or the dc adapter then you absolutely do n't want the axion you want the phillips on a recent airline trip the axion after a full charge conked out after less than two hours that 's not even a full movie in most cases the phillips ' battery is a bit bulky you 'd think that with today 's technology they 'd be able to slim it down but you ca n't complain about the hours of life you get with it after a full charge the axion 's battery is smaller and more lightweight than the phillips but what can you do other than watch a few spongebob episodes with less than two hours of battery life the phillips is good for at least 2 features before charging and that 's awesome for long trips where you ca n't use the dc adapter or car adapter the car adapter on both the axion and the phillips work great and they both have long cords so no need for the battery on car trips the axion at best might be a nice less expensive alternative if you wo n't be taking your portable dvd player to places that require battery use both the phillips and the axion fit in my small briefcase and they 're both relatively light the axion is a feather compared to the phillips amazon sells cases for the units that can mount on the back of the driver or passenger seats the case i got also mounts in between the driver and passenger seats i 'd highly recommend a case for your player i went with the case logic koskin dvd player case all in all phillips was a much more satisfying purchase for me for my purposes the axion just wo n't do for airline trips and that 's a major requirement hence the axion is a major disappointment but as i said earlier the axion is certainly a viable alternative if you do n't mind sacrificing screen size and you do n't plan on the need for battery power choose your view
this took out the package plugged it in and got nothing the power light would not come on the connection going into the unit seemed to be flimsy after wiggling the wire around i got some static on the screen finally i got the power to stay on and tried playing a dvd it played a few minutes and then froze up repeated this 3 times put it back in the package and mailed back to amazon
it 's you imagine that now you could put your tv up your wall and you get this box filled wit just 3 metal piece and bunch of screws and with a crappy instruction manuel the instruction mannnel does n't explain at all it 's difficult to attach the parts to your tv it does n't work with all kind of lcd tvs it only works wit some specific parts of walls of your house the only thing i could say do n't buy it
i have three reasons for my thinking they are simple and quick so here it goes it falls of my laptop very easily it is not very attractive at all and it is bulky and in the way hope this review help
this stand looks okay but it is very unstable when i put my monitor on it it took 20 seconds to stop wobbling very unsturdy
the device did not work well in my area i could not get it to hold a station without fading and static i tried all of the presets and all of the stations but could not get the right combination without a lot of interference it may work better in other areas i did like the design but it was a waste of money for me since i ca n't use it
too much interference work dont buy it ! thaddeus porras panama rep of panam
this item was a total bust sound quality is lousy reception is poor and you can barely hear your music come through it 's cheaply made and is obvious once you see the package it comes in and the product itself i would return it but by time i paid return shipping i 'd only get a few dollars back not worth it in any way
this product does not produce a clear sound the connection emits static and can be annoying to listen to we ordered two of these and they both have had the same results
this labeler will waste a lot of that expensive tape if one prints a 1 '' long label 2 '' are wasted but hey this is the trend they want to make the revenue on tapes not on the printers they learned it from hp and other printer makers
even with a brand new set of batteries this handset still fully discharges in a few hours even when no calls are made i have the older motorola and it has usually a 3 day life even when making several calls a day do n't buy the 76
i own the slightly older models md 760 and they do n't work with my time warner cable digital phone the phone does not ring you can see the call come in the display lights up the caller id shows up and you can answer it and talk but the ring circuit does n't activate this also affects the voice mail on the md 760 it never answers the phone since the ring circuit is not activating it does n't know the phone has wrung 4 times etc motorola tech support was completely disinterested they did n't want to forward the modem info to their engineers nothing btw time warner in san diego is using the arris cable modems the phone might work with other modems i do n't kno
phones wo n't stay connected to base station read the review from the guy who 's wife died while he could not dial 911. my wife has been yelling at me to get this two handsets fixed for 3 months do n't buy it !
my biggest complaint is about my id display the caller id flashes for only one ring then it says incoming calls '' i spoke to my phone local and long distant provider and they tell me it is the equipment that i use that is at fault it is true because i tested an old panasonic cordless phone i have and the id name does not disappear after one ring i usually do not get to my phone before one ring so in effect i never know who is calling and what good is it to have this feature there are many other shortcomings too many to list here
the phone has not worked since day 1. first the hand sets would not register customer service hours are only 8 to 8 eastern standard time so anyone on the west coast is looking at 5 telephone calls nothing like a little irritation before you even go to work right well repetitive calls take the battery out and cycle back up if your cell phone drops the call mine is a motorola you have to call back and start all over and hope that the last call was just documented they wo n't call you back if you are in the middle of trying something so then there was the instruction to unplug everything wait 24 hours and if it wo n't register call back then i 'm getting tired of 5 calls at this point then out of range messages which no one seems to be able to fix after so many calls and so much irritation about even setting this phone up i actually hate motorola now the customer service rep is nice it 's nothing personal but the company limits what they can do it 's all so irritating get better hours and let people call back if a cell phone drops the line while trying to fix the land line
i will be returning my cd changer while keeping the wave music system the reason is that it does not have the capability to shuffle between disks it will randomly play songs within one disk and then move to the next disk it can not play a song on one disk and then randomly switch to another disk btw the reason these systems are expensive is that they are made in the usa a great reason to buy bose
this phone replaces a siemens 2.4 ghz system that had served us well for 6 years we have been using this phone for about 45 days the phones randomly lose their programming and you have to sync everything back up and your outgoing message for vm while talking the volume sometimes cycles from regular to loud and back again the people on the other line do n't seem to detect the difference but it is annoying the headset jack is a joke in the manual it says that while it is only tested and approved with 2 headsets it may work with others i have tried 3 others and none work i have n't bought the approved '' headset yet so ca n't tell if that will even work the buttons are in contiguous bars horizontally and if typing in larger quantities of numbers often one does n't take on the first press plus there seems to be a delay in the pressing of numbers so you ca n't even dial quickly a few of the menus are good but others it seems like they lost interest in usability although there are a lot of features the ones i need like mute and a universal headset are n't there now i have to decide if i will ship them back or not i like that there is no interference with the microwave and the color display is nice but those items do n't seem to be good justification for the price of 3 handsets and a base with answering machine
so after scanning my first batch of cards which it worked great for the scanner simply stopped working correctly it could n't be recalibrated and wo n't read any more cards i called tech support only to learn that this is a known problem there is no fix available and that it 's likely due to their outsourcing of the manufacturing of this product i 'm returning the one i got and i 'd strongly recommend against getting one until the quality issues are resolved
not a worth while purchase you will be wasting your money on headphones that work some of the time when your tv is getting low volume feed dialogue for example you 'll get nothing but static imagine watching a movie and going through this every minutes i was told from rca that this is unavoidable and that i should consider using the headphones for listening to stereo music only although this may be fine for some people i would n't spend your money on a product that has blatent limitations trust me when i say there are much less expensive products that tower in comparison
do n't buy these they are total garbage they wo n't turn on at all i followed all of the instructions and still nothing avoid this
i am on my second pair of these thinking i had a faulty power connection with my first pair within days of owning the second pair i 'm having the same problem you can be enjoying your music and next thing you know you 've got static sending you to the ceiling gets very frustrating !
the batteries do n't last long at all if you send new batteries i will edit my review until then the product is rather worthles
the battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour i am very disappointed in the quality we need them for emergencies throughout the this is a farmed animal and we can not afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already i am willing to change my review if we get new batteries
maybe ok for around house but barely works mile from radio to radio ok for around the house but we have trees and whatever else seems to block the transmission we live in central mississippi i understand their test for 10 miles is in the desert where it is flat no rolling terrain which does n't roll that much in mississippi
i bought a pair in january and loved them sound is as lovely as everyone describes however there are something seriously lacking in the build quality the soft wires felt flimsy to me when i first opened it but i thought i 'd just take extra care at 1 month of careful usage the wires from earbuds downwards became so that i could almost use them as chopsticks and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion at 2 months of careful usage the wires had from the plug which i repaired the best i could with unsightly electrical tape however at month the left bud fell completely off i am very disappointed it is one of the phones i 've ever had i 've owned both grado and and sennheisers but man they need to do something about making this baby last
i got mine over a year ago and it 's been on the shelf collecting dust most of the time it was very difficult to work with it was difficult to get reception and i could never get the volume to adjust i was hoping for more of a '' experience and this is anything but i 've just renewed my xm subscription so maybe i 'll just get a new system that 's actually usable
overall the concept is very good works great in my truck works great in my home lots of road trips through the midwest and never had lost signal issues i even brought it on a fishing trip near the canada border and used my extra truck antenna we were 2 hours from the nearest paved road and it worked great but i 've had this product since dec of 2005 and have had to return it 3 times i do n't get reception at work so i like to record at night and playback the next day works great for about months then no more sound on recorded material have to send it back and its on my dime and i have to live without it for about weeks i wish this product was made a little better i wanted to give it 5 stars but 3 returns in 14 months not very good the only thing i had to buy extra for this product was a holder for my truck otherwise it came with everything you need
the product is fine but the shipping costs are astromical i put in an order and subsequently canceled due shipping costs of 25 for a 34 dollar order that is lucky to weigh a few ounces my advise is to not to order from blueproton till revise their shipping rates
i like the scan feature i like the weather feature i picks up too much rf noise ie line noise engine nois
i loved these so much at first so cute and had great sound they seemed to act as earplugs to the world outside and i loved that they did n't fall out like other earbuds however after a month of use the right ear stopped working and no one would take them back very frustrating make sure to buy these from the dealer so that they will take them back with the lifetime guarantee
when i first bought these things they were awesome and really cute i loved the volume control they isolated noise pretty well just not wind but for the price i guess one ca n't expect much all of a sudden the right ear just stopped working i only had them for about a month and i wish i kept the receipt or the box maybe i could 've had some sort of reimbursement but i 'll never know hopefully everyone else has better luck with thos
this is a decent case for the tungsten e but make no mistake about it it will not work for the model the plastic latch is cheap and the closure could be more secure
dispite having a confirmed that i have working skype account tested via a computer and usb phone the which has been correctly set up as per all included instructions keeps returning an incorect password '' message every time i try to log into skype with no i am not trying to log in when my pc is logged into skype and yes i am sure that i 've keyed in the correct skype name and password into the phone linksys outsourced tech support is useless they can do no more then rundown the same checklist that you can find yourself it all comes down to reset the phone reset the base station and it does not work i 'm sure that there has to be an identifiable reason for this to be happening but i 'll be returning the phone if skype tech support who i hope just might have a clue can offer no suggestions
i purchased the sandisk from eek technology for my canon powershot the package arrived promptly after being charged 12.00 for shipping and handling when the actual cost of postage was only cents my complaint brought a refund of only 4.00 leaving the company a whopping 8.00 to stick the item in a bubble envelope and ship it very nice profit now the really bad news the card simply does not work i formatted it tried it in friends cameras and did every thing imaginable but to no avail when i contacted eek they replied that the 30 day return period had expired only by hours depending on when the period begins and that i now had to deal directly with sandisk this is no way to run a business and i would caution others who sense a good buy '' to remember the old saying you get what you pay for '' glenn in nova scoti
looked good sounded good then i noticed the hum 60 hz coming from the bass ports on the back the lower you turn the volume the louder the hum though it was always very subtle the more i tried to ignore it the more annoying it became repositioning the unit had no effect nor did moving the cord or antenna or trying different modes cd radio aux the power cord has a plug and there was no way to ground the unit to see if that would solve the problem since this was to be used right next to the bed and normally played at low volume the hum was unacceptable particularly at the price of this radio paying shipping to return the radio has also left a bad taste in my mouth very disappointing
i bought this product the second time i used it the volume control broke i ca n't adjust the volume so i returned it for another one of the same model with the manufacturer three days later the same problem the volume control broke horrible quality product the manufacturer should pull the product and address the problem
this is a sincere comment on this product and my first one ever i bought it and i was excited to try it out in my bedroom the unit looks pretty nice and for the price it definitely felt like a good deal however the bass sound is absolutely terrible i did read about this in another review but i did n't expect that it would be this bad i actually checked the eq setting of my ipod to make sure it was n't in a bass boosting '' mode or anything like that i was hoping that if i turned it off i 'd get an ok sound and i 'd not have to go through the trouble of returning it my advice do n't buy this product it 's the only way we can tell these companies on the market just for the money that they can not just have a good external fashion '' design and a good marketing campaign that they will fool us and make money
i 've returned this item because the color is not pearl white as the website showed plus my friend also did not like this color since it does not match with her ipod
graphics are n't bad maps are fairly accurate and the same goes for the instuctions there are however a lot of flies in the ointment first and foremost very week ability to detect satellites the unit loses contact frequently and takes an inordinate amount of time to relocate them the slightest hint of clouds make this process take even longer second very puny cpu it 's calculations are excutiatingly slow so if you try to get the unit to set a route that 's longer than say 75 miles you may be done with a big chunk of the trip before the gps actually completes the calculation and of course once the original calculation is completed your current position is no longer the position the calculation is based on and the process of recalculation starts all over again very frustrating unless you are on a relatively short trip third it does have a player but it might as well not have it the sound is pretty bad and if heaven forbid you try to play music while it 's in the process of making any calculation whatsoever the sound gets worse and the calculation gets much slower all in all it 's better than no gps but the price differential between this and the better units i have an older garmin streetpilot unit with which i 'm very happy is not enough to justify the purchase
this navigational system is useless i have never gotten so lost before in my life it tells you to take next left when indeed it is in about 3 lefts vise versa with rights gave to my daughter and she constantly called me lost and upset so i tried it myself it literally took me about 9 miles out of my way to get to a local establishment tried changing the preferences and it was worse checked the manual tried everything if you put it on preferences for no toll it takes you in circles down back roads till your dizzy if you program it on it will take you miles out of your way to locate a toll road and then back again if you program to the middle of the preference line it does not know where the heck you are and keeps searching stay away ! this one is a waste of money
works fine as a usb charger but transmits a very low signal you have to crank your radio up to max to barely hear anything the background noise is louder then what you are trying to play and the noise is coming from the transmitter the fm channel choices should work in my area as there is next to no signal on them from a radio station but as soon as it is plugged in the background noise is horrific i even tried soldering some wire onto the transmitting antenna and putting it next to the cars antenna and it made no difference my ipod with a monster transmitter works flawlessly on the same frequencies
the unit works fine for charging my sandisk player but i can not get a clear broadcast through any of the available fm frequencies
you only have three choices of stations to use for transmission two of which were already occupied the third station should have worked but we were only able to get sound by turing the volume all the way up and even then it was quiet and poor quality the only good thing was that amazon was good about the return
product needed to be returned the transmitter is very poor and even after turning up my car stereo volume all the way i could barely even hear the music i thought it might be something i was doing but after checking all the settting it turns out it 's just a poor product i had my player volume turned up the transmitter was powered up the transmitter and my car stereo were tuned to the same frequency and the frequency i was using does n't have a radio station on it still nothing ! i would be careful ordering this product maybe the one i received just had problems but it does n't appear that i 'm the only one experiencing these problems after reading other reviews
horrible product it 's not the seller 's fault that it 's such a horrible product it just is the main selling point for this is that it has video capabilities well as much lag as there is even with super low quality video settings and with a lack of support for higher resolutions above it just ruins the selling point buy a dock made specifically for your notebook if you 're looking for video capabilities the rest of the ports work fine no ports though for keyboard and mouse just usb not any better than a port replicator bria
i own this product and have used it successfully on one notebook dell this product is a port replicator not a docking station for those that need tech mumbo jumbo its quite simple software controls this product and it operates according to very strict hardware rules the drivers are very unstable plus there is no support for some ati cards i would recommend at least of ram with a 7200 rpm hard drive in order to prevent lag and the screen of death please do n't buy if you do n't know what video card you have or if your computer is slow trust me i have 9 laptops and only one worked with this product do n't be a fool nvidea cards have more support
this item was ordered as a christmas present and arrived without incident it also arrived in a plastic bag with out any software or even a label saying what it was after installing this item and beginning use with it it became evident that the video portion of the device did n't work correctly the monitor hooked up displayed the same thing as my laptop but on a 5 second delay and the mouse and everything else appears to trail we updated all necessary drivers and sought technical support from targus it took them a long time to respond and once they did there advice was to hook the monitor directly up to the laptop defeating the purpose of having a docking station so with that said if you are looking for a usb hub this will work but if you are looking for a docking station with video as this claim i would strongly recommend you purchase something from a company other than targus
i was very disppointed in the video performance of this product i installed it on my new hp laptop with a 1.6 ghz centrino duo processor which took a phone call to tech support and a download of new drivers and found that there was a significant delay between what i was doing with the mouse and what i was watching on the screen the resolution you 're able to display on the external monitor is also limited a fact which would have influenced my purchase without video capabilities that actually work this product is a very expensive usb hub i 'm returning my docking station and using a usb hub it only adds one more plug instead of power and docking station i 'm plugging in power usb hub and vga cable and works infinitely better
i got this from dell with my laptop for some reason dell does n't make their docking station anymore so they just gave me this without telling me the brand and the model number i installed it with no problem but then the video through its usb is so extremly slow you will see about half second delay more your mouse pointer then while i tried connecting a serial port on the docking station it could n't transfer the data i tried installing a usb to parrelle port printer cable on the computer some how the targus drivers made my usb printing disable it does n't display any error messages at all i had to test the cable on another dell laptop to find out it was the docking station 's proble
got it far thanks giving day have used about half the pack and had about coasters and that too in a benq
you pay almost twice the price that you pay for other dvd burners then you waste four or five dvd 's before you find out by doing internet research that it will not burn unsupported '' dvd media at highest speed of course burning software should tell you that or adjust the burning speed for successful burn however that is too much to ask from free roxio software that plextor will give you it is bad engineering on plextor 's part that they will even not bundle a single sheet of paper saying up front that what media the burner will support
this tuner does not function properly it jumps all over the board from a to f to g and the dots in the middle in one pluck of the strings i have just spent an hour of my time trying to tune the guitar to no evail and let me tell you i have tuned cellos violins violas and have had vast experince in tuning instruments this was absolutly the worst tuner i have ever used
the onkyo receiver lasted less than one month i purchased it to replace a fisher receiver i have had for years thought it was time to replace it while listening to one of my favorite jazz tunes this new onkyo receiver sparked followed by the smell of a burning resistor needless to say i put my year old fisher receiver back in service and continued listening to my favorite jazz tunes they just do n't make them like they use to more to follow pending the results of the repair
the cartridge was apparently dried i unwrapped it from a sealed container carefully inserted it and no print appeared i carefully checked my printer and tried several more times i then bought a new black cartridge at greater expense and it worked fine immediately i shall not purchase ink cartridges from amazon again since the same thing happened with the color cartridge
never receieved this item contacted company told me it was the shipping fault
i used this mouse for a couple of weeks before it drove me nuts the thing skips around all over the place even when the mouse is sitting perfectly still on a flat surface the pointer was jumping around it became impossible to even click an icon i ended up buying a logitech mouse but this one was so cheap it was n't worth returning i know microsoft products are usually very good though so i must have just had bad luck with this one
i bought this instead of the basic microsoft mouse because it looks better however the scroll wheel is not very smooth and really loud i am going to buy the standard microsoft basic mouse instead
very bad purchase i buy new dvd panasonic in amazon and when i arrive the reader from dvd not read any disc none ! i buys by internet from costa rica and lost all the investment please no body buy this model of panasonic
this memory really i dont recomend because it doesnt work on any device even on my pc and lapto i dont know why and i returned and i bought a sankdisk and that one is pretty nic

after i received the item the so called mini sd card i put the card in the card reader and it read 0 a big 0 and i tried to find to but nowhere to be found i sent an email to the seller and am now going to send it back
bad news all the way around card does not work could not get response from seller
i had to return the card because it did not work not sure if this was a fluke or represents a larger problem with this provider
it 's a blank mini sd nothing recognizes it i tried it on my laptop a mini sd reader on my desktop and on my pda does n't work it 's either defective or just a blank case with nothing in it i 'm trying to return it now such a waste of time
i surely would n't reccomend buying this dinosaur bought it online and it never did work panasonic support '' was as bad as it 's dvd one support specialist told me to unplug it and then plug it in again another was reading from a list of what to do if the caller says this '' the repair shop gave me the idea that panasonic no longer makes this product they could n't find a replacement part so they are replacing my dvd in all i 've waited over a month and a half to watch my 299 dvd player and i still have n't got a new one from the repair shop if your smart do n't purchase one of these antiques
if there was a 0 rating i would choose it i bought this with the kingston minisd so i could download pics taken with cell phone into computer of course the minisd came with an sd adapter usually computer does not see the drive buty says insert disc into drive e '' sometimes this thing works if i push the memory chip in all the way into the reader but other times my pics are totally deleted and i have to reformat the memory chip to get it working again it 's a shame that this does n't work with kingston 's own minisd chip definitely do n't buy this thing it is n't worth one cent i plan to return it any suggestions on a reader from a different manufacturer
if there was a lower rating than 1 i would use it would not read my sd cards and to top it off now my card refused to work in the camera now i am out off pocket 7.95 and my sd card 's gon na cost me more in shipping to return this item
i had a iogear for a year after losing it recently i decided to give this kingston travellite a try major disappointment and i am going to buy the iogear one again pro fast usb 2.0 rate and supports sdhc con compatibility issue even with kingston 's own sd cards bulky it is so fat and thick that it completely blocks the remaining usb port on my laptop exchanging the card is more awkward than the iogear reader the cap is very flimsy
did n't work for my sd ultra ii on either my imac os or my windows xp laptop exchanged for another the replacement also does n't work
after using this case for a while i found the top cover did not close properly as it did when i purchased it the top cover can either slip inside or to the outside of the lip on the top left hand side of the case i am referring to the small metal tab that supports the case cover when closed located to the left and above the axim device lock button when your axim is in the case this poor fit causes the axim to get squeezed a bit at the point where the axim microphone is the case is not properly designed to ensure that this pinching or squeezing does not occur the case also has no secure locking mechanism to prevent the case from popping open if you should drop it this would potentially expose your axim to screen damage
this case did n't justify my expectations because first of all it looks cheap and built cheap when you close it frames look a little asymmetric my case is black so if you drop it by occasion it will have scratches another thing that i did n't like at all is that you ca n't use your cradle while your dell is in the case also it does n't work in my car 's mount it means that you have to pull your dell out all the time when you do it too often fastenings on the case loosen i would n't buy one like this anymore for this price if it cost me 5 i would
worked poorly for me i live about 15 miles from the transmitter s no channel was received properly without significant drop out gave up and bought a channel master 8 bay uhf antenna this worked great in my attic do n't waste your money get a real antenna
i wanted an cigarette lighter power adapter for my ipod but this must be for the old fire wire version my ipod cord is usb this was usless to me ! i am sure it works fine if you have a fire wire cable ! double check this before you make the purchace
this piece of junk will not work in all cigarette lighters it works in a nissan quest but not in a lexus rx 300
after a few weeks of being constantly plugged in the spring loaded sides that keep it firmly in place gave out now it just pops out of the cig lighter hole i have n't attempted to return or send it back for warranty service
mine gave errors on all ink carts at once my second of each cart all real epson ink all far from empty after only 3 months of use printing maybe 40 discs 20 dvd jacket inserts 50 pages of text the printer was on a table that swayed a bit as it printed so maybe that affected it epson sent a refurb not new as a replacement we 'll see how that one does oh yeah it also guzzles ink if you print lots of full color but the printouts are nice looking for good papers never tried glossy stuff
this printer gulps down expensive ink at an alarming rate i printed a dozen cd 's and four 5 x 7 photos and it used about 75 of the ink that came in the cartridges that came with it the ink is pricey nearly 14 a cartridge yes it prints nicely but the cost of ink is prohibitive avoid this printer like the plague unless you enjoy wasting money
i will never buy another epson product after my epson stylus photo died exactly 3 years after purchase this was a lightly used machine for household purposes only i believe epson this obsolescence so that user is told parts inside your printer have reached the end of their life '' there is no toll free number to call no literature given at time of purchase deals with this event very very disappointed with this manufacturer
i received the printer as a great gift on january i set it up and it would n't print the ink cartridge holder seemed stuck in place i called epson who shipped me out a replacement with no charge or delay i used that printer for two weeks and it quit same problem with the ink cartridge holder once again epson customer service shipped me a new replacement printer it worked for another two weeks and quit on me yesterday same problem so i 'll call epson when they open tomorrow and try to upgrade to a printer or try once again the printing results are spectacular especially when using epson glossy paper anyone else with problems
was ready to buy the our kingston sd card did not work in the display models at bestbuy and compusa the pic demo did not work in either store the same sd card works fine in both our digital cameras as well as my dell sd slot one sales person tried the sd card in a neighboring hp photo printer and it worked fine there
i received and installed this card yesterday it was not recognized by windows 2000. neither was the driver included on the cd sabrent 's site did n't have any driver for the card either but did have a wonderful faq link about it well i 'm assuming that it was wonderful since the url was broke i 'm giving them a chance to respond before i send it back
only a few channels worked and were fuzzy sound never worked remote worked once then never again cheap product dont buy i
it 's cheap but i could n't get it to work it seems to be a problem with the drivers i wrote to the company for help multiple times but could n't pin them down on any clear instructions they 'd tell me to download the drivers from the internet but when i responded that i allready did so and it still did n't work they would n't tell me where to go from there they stopped responding to my i 'm pretty computer savvy so if i was unable to get the thing working after several hours i do n't think anyone else will be able to either
i returned this product it only comes with one mount i felt the description indicated there would be two i went to and was able to purchase a pair that worked great for less than 9.00
i will tell you why it sucks battery like a beast and does n't have radio you could find somethig with radio at the same pric
looking for my first player thought something small and inexpensive might be where to start so got i this one big mistake the screen was just impossible to read tiny in every way and the included instructions were utterly useless i 'm not sure what purpose the cd serves because i could n't get anything from it but warnings about possibly screwing up my laptop if i continued and error messeges i know there are 8 year olds out there who could figure this out easily but i really need something simpler to use and easier to read i am going to return this and try something that is about twice the price
this gel mousepad with wristrest is pretty hard on the wrist you really have to press hard to get it to conform to the shape of your wrist is is n't very comfortable the gel is made from plastic polymers and it has an odour of plastic it is not washable so it gets dirty and stays dirty you ca n't replace the gel packs if it gets a leak there are better mousepads with gel wristrests out there
i have this cable installed on a deck using a ipod photo the interface completely circumvents everything that is good about the interface on the ipod itself 1. the controls and display on the ipod are disabled when connected the head unit you must use the head unit to control the ipod and you can not see information about the currently playing track on the ipod 2. when searching through artists albums songs or playlists on the deck only one item is viewable at a time contrasted with 5 or 6 items viewable on the ipod screen itself this makes it extremely dangerous to browse through your music while driving if you do n't already know exactly what you want to listen to 3. one tick '' of the control knob on the deck scrolls through 1 item on the ipod scrolling does not speed up as you continue to turn the knob if you want to scroll through artists expect to spend fully 2 minutes or more twiddling the knob while driving i ca n't even begin to describe how frustrating this is 4. there is absolutely no way to speed up the process there is no fast scrolling mode that skips through artists at a time there is no way to scroll by letter of the alphabet no nothing 5. when scrolling through items the menu returns to the beginning of the list each time you pull it up if you spend 90 seconds scrolling to new order '' then next you want to listen to something by nirvana have fun scrolling for another 90 seconds it 's as if alpine did n't bother to user test this system at all with ipods it 's a complete embarassment and i will be returning it as soon as possible
there has been a here the item pictured here is not the coby tf the given here do not match the and capabilities of this item the given here do not even match the tf ! here 's what you are looking at the coby tf for go to this device has a 3.5 inch screen it does not have two headphone jacks or two sets of headphones it will not display jpeg images from a disc it does not have a zoom function in the playback mode amazon has been notified but is not taking responsibility for the techdepot the amazon partnet actually delivering this product has been notified but is not taking responsibility for the techdepot will take the item back no problem but if you wanted the item described they wo n't have it as far as i can tell nobody has it the closest thing out there is the coby tf which has a 4.5 inch screen looks like the one pictured here and matches the description here except that it does n't have two headphone jacks i do n't know where that came from ! hope this saves you some aggravation
i bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time i could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network ready printer problem is the hp laserjet 1020 does n't work with either the netgear or linksys printservers which boggles the mind my customer wa n't happy and neither am i
we chose this printer because of the network capability the first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks to print we had to turn the printer off then back on and then print we had to do this every time we wanted to print hp sent us a replacement printer and it worked correctly for 4 days after over an hour on the phone with hp i was told the printer is not very stable in a network application and we should use the printer via a usb connection if hp knows the unit is not stable in a network environment then hp should correct the problem or stop selling the unit
easy set up simply does not work i have no ir or rf interference and i set up to debug by puting the transmitter in the adjacent room and placing the receiver directly in front of the unobstructed units 8 feet away can not get any device to work through this transmitter if i make 20 keystrokes one will get transmitted successfully great concept really poorly engineered
it was easy to install but that is where the good points end to make this device work i can not be farther away from the transmitter than 4 feet and even given this short distance i have to point the remote to be extended at the receiving unit very precisely i should have cross hairs on my remote controllers SMILE yes i know unbelievable also the infrared transmitting power of the receiver is weak to say the best it pretty much has to point directly at the device s that are the recipients of the remote control signal it certainly does n't flood '' the room with the infrared signal as an electrical engineer i know how easily this could be accomplished please stay away from this product i am contemplating putting it into my recycle bin it is absolutely useless
i bought this thing and it does not work i have used other extenders before that do work in my house this did not work and when i called the amazon sales distributor they told me to call terk terk wanted me to pay to send it back to them i still have it
but i ordered it and amazon sent me an entirely different product i got ordered the leapfrog and received a generic product pretty deceptive actually not happy
i bought this item a wile ago and all the connection kit but besides the poor information they give you even in the linksys support they dont even know what they are selling anyway i attached the wireless kit ap base and this antennas all of them linksys and i got about 10 more feet of range wich is nothing i think this anttenas are too expensive for nothin
got my printer and have been really excited about producing scrapbook pages well it is jan and i just got my sheets delieverd and guess what it wo n't print them just as other customers stated the paper just spits out blank i called the place i purchased it from and they are working with hp to get me my money back it works fine for 8 x 11 pages but does n't recognize the pages and that the reason i purchased it stay away from this one you will be frustrted
i bought this printer to make large format photo prints of my husband 's artwork and never got anything good enough to sell the feed mechanism is awful all the heavier papers and card stocks jammed or had marks the printer went into terminal carriage stall at about 10 months with an estimated 10 hours of total use i too tried all the online help items but could n't afford the time to deal with the phone people i emailed hp about returning the printer when it was still under warranty and their response was they would n't accept it unless i sat through their awful ordeal and went through all the steps i had already tried i was so mad i took it to compusa who is supposed to be an hp repair place but they would n't do anything without hp authorization and guess what you have to sit on hold to prove you are worthy of their attention the end result i threw it away i 'll never buy another hp even though i am happily using my 79 printer bought a decade ago that still feeds magnificently and still makes great prints just not big ones what a sad end to a great printer line
the printer worked well for a while then after about a month simply spat out two sequential pages of blank paper each time we tried to print with it hp technical support was extremely poor i had to sit through an hour of a fellow called raj saying will you please be pressing '' this button or that button will you please be turning off the printer and turning it on again '' and trying out a whole series of inane tests that i told the tech support person i 'd already tried to no avail finally we were told to return the printer which should not have taken an hour ! and the support guy said please be sending all your printer 's accessories and new ink cartridges with the printer please '' so we did including ink cartridges the duplexer and the rear paper feeder as raj instructed and after a few days received the printer back minus the duplexing unit the rear paper feeder and the ink cartridges ! it took a lot of cajoling with hp support '' to have the duplexer replaced and the rear paper feed unit was never replaced at all they claim to have lost it then after a week the printer started malfunctioning again in the exact same way in the company can afford to spend the time for raj or his friends to put us through a long series of tests give us misleading information send us an incomplete unit following which we will waste more time engaging in frustrated diplomacy sorting out the mess hp will make it 's just not worth it good technical support pays for itself about in customer satisfaction and referrals the standard of hp support was so abysmal that i can not recommend this printer
i needed an antenna that provided a power boost to amplify the signal i bought this antenna based on the review of others if i had realized it did n't amplify the signal i would have looked elsewhere oh well my bad ! i live miles from the signal i 'm trying to capture and this antenna did n't do it for me
i live three walls from line of site to the tv broadcast towers and get very poor to no reception towers are 5 miles from me either this is defective or a very poor antenna
this antenna allowed me to receive 2 hd channels in my area but it gave me no better reception than my thumb placed over the end of the coaxial cable basically any antenna will be as effective as this
i had high hopes but this radio does not fill them first fm sensitivity the ability to pick up weak stations seems worse than my cheapo sony analog radio your lucky to get all the stations you are accustomed to alternate channel selectivity the ability to sort out one station from another when they are close in frequency was lousy but the worst part of all is the fm noise floor this radio when receiving a strong signal is not quiet you can hear background hiss on a strong station even in mono mode so i either got a bad sample of this product or this is simply a very average performing radio i would say not worth the price not recommended
after reading the great reviews i was really looking forward to using this small clock radio in my bathroom i guess the reception was ok but i was very disappointed in the sound quality i have a couple of inexpensive small portable radios with much better sound but i was looking for a radio with a clock as well i am returning the radio
although the radio still works the searchlight illuminated only once the first time i turned it on it has n't worked again since the radio works while plugged in unplug it and come back in an hour and no more charge i used the hand crank i cranked that handle for well over a minute when i pressed the on button the radio did n't work ! this radio is worthless in an emergency i give it one star because this radio does work while plugged in plus the dial is well lit illuminating the stations in blue light
like most gpx radios this offers much and does n't deliver reception is very poor at best and the lack of batteries other than the and rechargeables makes no sense at all you ca n't just pop in a couple of alkalines and use it you must wait for it to charge or turn the handle could pose a problem when the batts stop holding a charge i returned mine within hours of the purchase
the antenas on this unit are so small they might as well not be there if you live within a mile or two of a radio tv or weather station you will get fair reception otherwise you will not get any ! even the am antena is undersize the sound quality was very poor with much whistling and poping from poorly sheilded poorly tuned circuits there is no option for regular batteries or dc power options connections for external antenas am fm tv weather band and high quality antenas as options would be great the clock alarm display buttons digital tuneing and flashlight are well designed however the company needs to put in a telescoping antenna for fm tv and weather band and a larger am antena or they should take this product off the market as an emergency radio '' in an emergency information can save your life and lack of it can kill you the poor reception from this unit will not give you the critical information you need in an emergency situation come on gpx yorx electronics you can build better products than this ! i returned mine for a refund i have purchased an american red cross emergency radio '' and found it to be it at least gets 2 weather band stations instead of zero on the gpx unit and with a lot of finess manually tuneing you can get a few tv stations i am trying a sony portable radio with timer '' next it has no built in charger or flashlight so haveing extra batteries is mandatory for emergencie use perhaps someone will come up with dc hand generator batterie for powering any device with a dc adaptor plug one that works with cell phones would be very good for the next hurricane like katerina
my player was 32 days old and it died it will not start when i turn it on it just sits at the initilize screen and will not go any further
i used this case for one it gently and it fell apart
ok maybe it was in the fine print or something but this alarm clock is tiny ! i did n't realize it would be so small it can pretty much fit in te palm of my hand
the transaction was good but the product was not good the product was not new because it was n't sent in its original package it was just sd card and cover
the fan is so weak it makes the product useless it may be able to cool a small flea perhaps an ant maybe a centimenter of human skin do n't waste your money
i have n't had the opportunity to use these cables my electronics are denon and be warned they will not work with these cables hdmi to
first of all the cable is very difficult to install it 's rigid and not flexible after i connected my cable box and my lcd hdtv with this monster cable hdmi my service provider time warner cable told me that they do n't support hdmi i should use the component cable that comes with the cable box well i already opend the box and it 's too late to return every now and then i get a message on my tv saying you can not use hdmi cale please use the component cable to watch tv '' i had to turn my tv off and on to get rid of that screen some hd channels ' volumes are very low i have to turn to the loudest in order to listen has it anything to do with the cable time warner wo n't care the sales guys from circuit city said it 's must to get bla bla bla in order to watch best high definition channels this hdmi cable is one of the recommendations i 'm too naive to trust them i should have researched more before making a purchase i do n't like the cable at all sooner it 'll destroy either port the cable or the tv
as for digital technology monster cable has once again ruined the marketplace by greatly over estimating what their products are worth the great difference with the digital devices compared to analog is simple if the digital signal reaches the device it needs to it ca n't be any more or less clear because your digital signal is comprised of 0 's '' and 1 's '' if you can see your tv or hear the music then what ever cable you use there is no distortation across digital signals so do n't pay the extra in fact you should n't need to spend more than around
image is good but microphone has a jackhammer noise rendering it useless i only installed it after a few months after purchase or else would have returned it immediately
i purchased this card and the sandisk 512 cf simpletech would n't format in the the sandisk worked like a charm previous experience had this card fail in a week i should have known better i have never had a problem with sandisk but have been bitten twice with simpletech
i have been using since 1999 and have never had as much of a problem with as these sometimes the burn okay but the data verification stage usually fails i use nero to burn cds they seem okay for data cds which i would n't have bought a spindal for data cd use for audio cds i have had a horrible results they burn okay but hardly any of my cd players will read them i have tried brand new dvd players to play the audio cds with the same result sometimes they will play but the tracks will pop his and sound distorted eventually the sound quality drops over time i think i would be better off with an lp record compared to the sound and over all and life span of these as they get older the few that discs cd players can read have tracking problems when you press for instance track 8 it takes a long time to seek to that track and plays the wrong track in the middle of the track too my very first set of bought in 1999 were verbatium when they were still made in japan those original discs were great and they still play like new to this day based on my experience i would not recommend these unless you only need to burn data my last was sony and they worked perfectly i have also used memorex fuji kodak ibm to name a few of the main ones with out a single bad burn or problem i did have issues with audio cds with older imations speed so i will not purchase the imation as well as the verbatium brand ever again
i just got a spindle of these with the same part number from compusabusiness they are not mcc dye they are cmc magnetics corp dye type 6. if you want true discs do n't buy these also note this item ships from office depot not amazon they charge high shipping
i do not know why they named these gumy headphones there is nothing gumy about them except the look they are large in size and as hard as a rock i bought them for my 14 year old daughter and they are too big and uncomfortable i tried them in my ears and agree i recommend spending a little more money and getting something that is comfortable and it will sound better too
i thought because these are gumy '' headphones they would be comfortable but they are not they hurt my ears as much as any other if ear pain is your problem when you wear then do n't get these
portable dvd fits nicely into case it holds the battery and all other materials that came with dvd player i would recommend it for protection and transportatio
it 's clumsy cumbersome not great quality and a bad idea in addition to that mine will no longer work after very limited use wish i could get my money back
bought this speker for my ibook should have save my spealers are not much better than internal ibook speakers
this card died on me after about a year of use my laptop will detect the card but it wo n't power up my reaction good riddance ! i now have an excuse to get a different card as others have stated this card uses its own drivers and they do n't work well everytime i woke my laptop from suspend mode the card would fail to reconnect to the network forcing me to remove and reinsert the card then do a 'repair ' of my connection huge hassle it looks like you get what you pay for with these cards so stay away from the cheap ones !
i tend to break my wireless cards for my laptop i had cisco 's belkins netegars and they all worked flawlessly with the the software will not even install on my windows xp laptop when you double click it it just wo n't come up or comes up for a second only i got it to work by using the native windows drivers for about 15 minutes then it repeatedly caused windows blue screens i talked to tech support but as with all network companies you get some junior person who follows a script no help there at all though the phone was answered quickly i have used many network vendors and consistently dissapoints me i have a wireless printserver that is bad too this was the second and last time i go for the cheap price they just have bad products and if you add shipping and return fees and all the headache you can buy a better product
i was trying to connect this adaptor to my laptop almost for 3 days i was calling 's customer service all the time i was kept on hold for more than one hour after that they did not give me any solution to fix the problem
like other reviewers i 've had nothing but trouble with the revision of this card constantly this card would refuse to connect to my wireless network while other systems with cards from different manufacturers had no issues the installer is terrible and installs three different programs in programs the software that comes the card increases boot time significantly and there is no easy way to remove the icon from the system tray on the upside after attempting to download the latest drivers i ended up downloading the drivers for the revision as they do n't have the listed and these surprisingly worked alot better go figure
i wish i would have read the earlier reviews on this mouse had i done so i would n't have purchased this one no sence in kicking a dead horse but i concur with any and all of the previous complaints frustration is the wor
this mouse works fine on my laptop however it goes through a pack of batteries within weeks i hate it if i still had the packaging for this mouse i would have returned it no wonder it is so cheap
i have n't even been using it for a week before it went bad it is freezing on me right now as i type this review it just does n't work it was n't turning off at all when i would store nor will it turn on when i want it to you would think the maker of swissarmy would do a little better than this mine is going in the trash ! save yourself 25
this would be a great wireless mouse if it were n't for it 's battery usage it runs on dual aaa batteries they need replacing about every weeks i do not recommend this mouse instead of adding to my large collection of aaa batteries i 'm purchasing another mouse that handles battery usage efficiently
yeah the design is great ! it is a nice fit but if only i had n't gone through 4 sets of batteries in one short week 's time ! the last straw is that even that does not keep this mouse going for very long now it keeps freezing '' and it 's gotten to where it does n't even connect now i 'm sick of it and i 'm gon na beg the store to exchange it for something that actually works do n't waste your money
on the surface this is a slick mouse it 's cute small and stowing the receiver in the mouse is great but after using this for a week and a half i 'm ready to throw it out let 's see 1 it refuses to turn back on after being stored i 'll pull it out of my laptop bag the receiver and no juice the mouse does n't turn on even though it 's automatically supposed to turn after you unstow the receiver i have to open the mouse up and reseat the batteries 2 sometimes when i plug the receiver into my laptop it does n't get recognized i try multiple ports and nothing once i reboot it 's 3 the absolutel last straw as of last night the mouse motion will suddenly freeze you 'll be mousing around and the mouse will suddenly lock up the buttons will click the mousewheel will still scroll the page but the cursor will be frozen it only becomes unstuck '' when you scroll the wheel it 's absolutely aggravating to be working on my design work only to get stuck scroll the wheel move the mouse figure out where my cursor has now gone it places it randomly and then go back to work only to repeat the process all over again seconds later i 'm really disappointed i 've bought a few other wenger products and never had a problem i honestly did n't think twice when i was looking for a wireless mobile optical and saw this one with the wenger logo it 's actually more expensive than the one i was originally looking at but i thought hey it 's a wenger '' i 'll be thinking twice from now on piece of crap
tons of static and i have a direct line running from this into my car stereo not fm tuner it chares fine and cuts off ipod when i turn off engine but the amount of static makes it unusable i would have been better off with just a cheap charger for the car
i bought this to connect via '' monster patch cable directly to my cd player there is a ton of static and line noise introduced when using it this way if i could give it zero stars i would ! avoid !
i purchased the backpack and thought the many compartments would be great however there is not as much room for documents and folders and i thought the padding is great for laptop protection the backpack is very heavy and hurts my back when carrying through an style and look is good function is poor
as long as its on it will prevent scratches but its tough to get off and that act can scratch your laptop it scratched my macbook when i pried it off the guy at the apple store who snapped it on a macbook beause i requested a demo '' could n't pry it off and after 10 embarassing minutes he called a colleague over and they pried it off together and to be honest this makes the mb look ugly kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel
i bought one of these when i bought my macbook to keep it in pristine condition just a few months ago i just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my macbook they should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the macbook of a softer material or created a design where it wo n't rub against the laptop really stupid design it may have protected against some very minor scratches but likely i 'm worse off for using this cover scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity i do n't think in the long run it was worth 40 and i feel very misled by the marketing for this cover given the choice again i would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money
i bought 6 of these in a rush as the first picture clearly shows a targus laptop lock or a darn close match i should have looked at the other 2 pictures as only the middle picture is accurate the last one is a key ! ! ! lock with a covered cable i 'm amazed that this vendor would dare show pictures of 3 completely different locks presumably representing what you are buying the one you get smells of machine oil and is cheaply built probably 3.00 in chinatown i 'm extremely disappointed as now i need to return them and repurchase good ones
i purchased this case to store my dvds along with the inner and outer liner notes unfortunately the sleeves are only large enough to hold in the inner notes since most of my dvds only had the outer liner notes this case was pretty useless in general the design of the product left much to be desired if by xtreme '' it means big and bulky then the description is right on
it not transparent cover so its hard to figure out which cd it is i had to put all stickers to recognize cds faster
the dvd covers will not even fit in the sleeves provided realizing i 'm tearing up my covers plus i ca n't see my dvds in the thing it was n't worth using it i find better ones at walmart
not worth the cheap price very cheap materials and i ended up just getting rid of it
folks if you purchased this unit and the plastic band broke call logitech support at once you prove that you have the old model and send it back to logitech they will cross ship you a the new free pulse model which has a high strength carbon headband you will have to pay shipping but you are getting a great pair of headphones to replace the previous defective model
i can not get it to work i have and asked for help with no response so i guess i will be returning it if i get it to work or the seller helps me i will amend this post as it stands though i give it 2 stars they did ship it quickly and it was packaged well
the test i used this longer gold plated cable to replace a shorter plated cable the result i saw a much more grainy '' picture delivered only in black and white i tried several different inputs and outputs but the problems were fixed only when i removed this belkin cable and replaced it with the older generic cable the verdict this cable delivers substandard picture quality and robs you of viewing video in color it does not work 'fine ' as attested by other reviews if you do n't want to shell out the cash for a higher quality cable upwards of ft stick with less expensive cables
this keyboard folds out well and i liked the feel of the keys however the ir connector needs to be in direct connection with the ir port in the pda for the ipaq this port is at the bottom of the handheld the 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area in order to have the proper connectivity you have to turn the handheld on its side this then requires another software program download not freeware that i can find to rotate your screen to the landscape view unless you can read sideways without getting a headache before buying this product check your handheld to see if your ir port is between o'clock if so this may be a difficult keyboard to use
despite not being written on the packaging or website my hp ipaq was compatible with this keyboard unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad clogging my pda making it run very slowely as well as this it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change in terms of hardware i found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem while targus does include all 5 rows of a standard keyboard it shrinks the top row numbers and the bottom row space bar this makes it very difficult to use the space bar which is for some reason split into three parts and the numbers which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way i found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register in terms of key position there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult some keys are also very small the right shift key and backspace making them difficult to use strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards one of the biggest problems i had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen this mouse cursor is useful but needs to be supplemented with normal up down left and right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document using the mouse to do this is very frustrating the final negative thing about this keyboard was the price i paid aud 149.95 for this keyboard doing some research on the internet found better models think outside stowaway ir keyboard available for less than half the price around aud 70 and bluetooth keyboards available for less than aud 190 i think it might be about time targus releases a new model pda keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get no more tiny keys and no more than two space bars
i can not speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about 20 of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo 270. this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i can not determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda
i bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when i replaced my palm with an hp ipaq the combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and i used in nearly every day after my positive experience i expected my new ir keyboard to function the same way what a dissapointment ! i can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me i found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation i usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys the little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the pda at all securely even bumping the table can knock it off and i have taken to using an elastic band to keep my ipaq in place the mouse '' arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard unlike the stowaway i will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search
i am now on my second gaming mouse it is not the battlefield 2142 model with the graphics but still the same mouse the first one refused to work out of the box i spent hours online researching the problem i found another computer to test it on and also another mouse to verify my usb ports were working ok on my computer i finally took it back and got an exchange the second one worked for all of two weeks and then went dead it lights up like the first one but will not move the pointer i would not recommend this mouse to anyone unless they are willing to spend the time and hassle to buy then take it back for a full refund i am sure it must work for some but two in a row is a record for me it does feel and operate very well when it works although i did not get a chance to play with different configurations of weights the weights seem more like a gimmick to me but i could be convinced with experience and feedback from other users
i like this amp but it causes my tv sharp aquos 42 '' lcd to lose synch whenever the video has a sudden white flashes nfl sports transitions war of the worlds blasts drawn together transitions explosions stuff like that the synch loss takes about 5 or so seconds for my particular tv to recover from which is pretty annoying when i had the problem i searched the web and found that numerous others had similar problems with this and other onkyo receiver models but onkyo does n't seem to acknowledge the issue it 's a good receiver but if you buy it save the packing for a few weeks just in case it causes problems for your tv as well given that these problems seem to have been around for a good year or more and onkyo is n't fixing them i can only give this 2 stars
bought 3 for the company the one works great hp dj 9800. the one did n't it sees the printer canon but nothing was printed netgear said that it was n't compatible the printer the one printed only once on hp color laserjet 4550. now the supplied admin program does not see both overall intallation should be simpler the factory default static ip is wrong choice no reset button unplugging the cord will rest the unit to the factory default it means that you have to set it again on every power interruption a in it industry ! ! i expect more professional solution from netgear
i work at a company that has had a many as 10 of these installed at once the problems were few at first but over time you had to turn it off and back on to get it to start printing eventually the ethernet port seemed to wear out you had to jiggle '' the cord to get the link light to turn on the software is great but the device itself is poor quality we have begun phasing these 's out at our company and only have 2 left
apart from the fiddly nature of the charger it does all it says apart from the one main thing if you intend to have it connected to your car whilst driving the charger is not shielded thus a ridiculously loud hum can be heard through the sound system as it charges for the sake of a cheap shielding mechanism to prevent this problem could be easily solved buy at your own peri
overall the helix lives up to being the new generation of xm recievers i especially like the option of being able to store my own on the unit as well as recording xm content either by time frame or on a song by song basis the only problem here is that sometimes the fades are cut off when recording a song those of us familiar with xm know that the units do not work well indoors unless connected to the antenna from the home kit the car antenna seems to work fine on a par with my delphi myfi unit the built in antenna on the helix is marginal i have been able to get a decent signal by positioning the unit however when walking or moving about the reception is definitely intermittent this is where my pre recorded and xm content comes in handy i would have rated the unit higher if the helix were not falsely advertised as being able to transmit to an fm receiver from both the home and the car docks prior to purchase i even went as far as downloading the manual which specifically states that the unit has this feature this is simply not true in that the unit transmits fm from the car dock only i am enjoying the helix but object to having to purchase an fm transmitter for home use
if you 're planning on using this much as a radio think again the reception on trains over land is terrible the reception at work in an interior office is worse xm customer service will tell you that you have to sit next to a window for optimal reception as an player it 's okay as long as you do n't have a vast itunes library it does n't work with itunes at all and the software that samsung provides is for pc only just my opinion
i was so excited for this unit only to find that it was n't the quality i expected first the fm transmitter only works in the car dock not included so if you want to use it at home make sure your stereo has audio jacks or an aux jack second the product was defective my songs on the repeat sometimes and the headphone jack is faulty causing the sound to cut out and sound bad unless you hold the cord into the unit this happens with both the and the xm sat radio so i know it is n't reception samsung offered to repare it but the tech support is awful and unknowledgable we 'll see what happens
reviewing the weather news radio do not buy this radio it is cheap made in china and is a lousy radio you can not tune it into a station it slides all over the tuning capacity is zero reception on any band is terrible the settings are all mixed up again reception lousy weather band too this radio is really the worst not buy it waste of money very overpriced it does not live up to what is written about it rating horrible '' not buy
this player is useless if you own a macintosh you need the safely remove hardware '' wizard in windows to modify the charging status even if you purchase a power adapter sold separately you will not be able to use the software for your player also the buttons are too small for practical use and look cheaply made overall the player looks like a children 's cell phone
i bought this card because i had heard it works well with linux well i did n't get that far with card because when it arrived it was doa and does n't work at all so now i have to either pay shipping to send it back to amazon or contact dlink and try to get them to send me a replacement
i 'm having the same connectivity issues as the other two reviewers noah and casey we have two servers where i installed the cards running windows 2003 standard server with and all updates the servers are connected to gigabit switch the connection starts just fine but it cuts off in about 2 to 4 min of medium file traffic and the servers become inaccessible not even responding to pings the card needs to be reset to restore the connection only to drop it again in the next 3 minutes we tested the switch to ensure it 's working and we tested the cabling as well everything seemed working fine finally we gave up and installed more expensive intel gigabit cards no problems since then
hi i have a similar setup to noah 's i use media center 2005 though and similar issues with my dlink while transferring files between 2 computers with a gigabit the transfer does not complete as the network cuts off the connection beforehand the network will also cut off freeze quite often when i use the windows remote connection '' to access the computer equiped with the dlink card that computer also has based onboard lan which i disable when using the gigabit card which functions perfectly under all eliminating all potential issues with the router and switch i do not believe the card is defective per se another will probably have the same problem but it may be a pci port compatibility problem my motherboard is the asus deluxe which is a fairly recent mb with full updated bios and of course windows xp updates would appreciate any assistance on this matter best case
unlike many people writing reviews of the product i have n't even been able to install the software as it does n't support windows vista
most of the claims made on the description require a service so the service costs a fortune compared to the camera the basic management software that came with it is bad its old and no updates available many features are unavailable and if you actuate the drive space limitation the whole setup is trashed and you have to start over in setting up again some of the features that dont work are the ablilty to name cameras and it sometimes just misses one of the 4 cameras for no apparent reason the hard sold feature '' of emailed info from a motion sensor and being able to check vids from the internet is the service shame on the maker for selling a partly disabled product and then asking a monthly fee to make it work
what an awful product after less than a week of use the camera will no longer connect to my wireless network even when it did it kept causing the wireless router to crash several times a day recording settings for the camera software were lost if the computer was the instruction manual is poorly written and does n't even accurately describe the software interface save your money
i got the camera installed and working with no problems at all the motion detection actually works as advertised image quality is extremely poor though would be hard pressed to recognize a person standing more than 10 feet from camera was unable to configure the remote access service i use a linksys router as well the documentation for proper port and firewall settings is minimal and there is no troubleshooting help to be found anywhere on the web for this product including the linksys web site
i 'm amazed that linksys could put out such a crappy product it 's huge and the picture quality is incredibly poor the only way to use it is with ie or bad utility progra that comes with it firefox messengers and skype wo n't work i wanted to use it to embed the picture in a web site the only way to do it is to pay them to host it for you wow ! i 've asked for an api to write some software for it but linksys refused please save your money
i did not see any picture quality improvement using this high priced monster cable i get the same quality pictures from my 8.00 cable bought from biglots so purchased a hdmi cable but believe me the picture quality from my cheap component cable is still good eventhough hdmi pictures are little better when i compared with the pictures from hdmi cable
if the sound quality that you 're looking for can be equated with an old radio you might be pleased even so you would probably expect to pay around 15 for the product not something in the 40 plus range ! like another reviewer i had very low expectations for such small speakers but apparently not low enough the speakers can not handle bass at all and to avoid complete sound distortion you need to keep the volume very low which essentially forces you to literally be within a foot or two of the unit furthermore there 's no easy way to retreive your ipod once inserted ! i feel i have been deceived by the 5 star reviews i used to make my purchasing decision and felt obligated to respond the miniblaster is a good concept poorly executed and i 'm afraid i wasted my money
i purchased the garmin forerunner 201 from amazon believing i was buying a reliable piece of gear it does n't work properly in any built up area city where most of us live or areas with too many trees where we city dwellers like to go when we leave the city basically it leaves stretches of your running route out but the stop watch carries on ticking so if you 're like me and take satisfaction in turning out runs or what passes for for us amateurs the 201 will only be a source of frustration it 'll time your run perfectly just like any duh ! but then leave out some of the distance you ran so that you get a mile for mile average that in a very suspicious way particularly when you 've put out a steady effort and it 'll miss out bits of your course in different places on a basis you 'll find yourself adapting '' the info the device gives you how 's that for precision the interval training feature is even worst you dial in some mile repeats with a timed interval and set off at full blast the minutes tick by and the mile never ends ! that 's when you find that there are gaps in the mile '' you 're running and you 're killing yourself when you 've actually done the mile and should be in your rest period i kid you not i would n't dare sell a gps device that works 70 of the time and i 'm not speaking of heavily built up areas i run in spaces where the closest buildings are at least feet away but this is not the worst of it i though i was getting a well made piece of equipment i live in brazil so i bought it off amazon and a friend kindly brought it over for me from the us in less than 1 year it started turning by itself in a crazy dysfunctional way rendering it totally unusable currently it does n't stay on for more than 1 minute at a time it now runs it 's battery flat by itself even though i 'd been scrupulously careful it not taking it out in the rain and drying off the moisture sweat after every run religiously some of you may say i should have used the warranty but when you have mailing costs and if the thing 's fixed or replaced 100 customs duty when it gets sent back here you 'd give up just as i did i 'm not paying twice for a piece of gear that never worked properly in the first place my conclusion try some other model or even brand i 'd not lay my cash on this gizmo again
i purchased the garmin forerunner 201 but when i received the watch it would charge so i have not been able to use it and now it is back with the manufacturer garmin warranty is for 1 year so everthing should work out but i have not received it back yet so i do not have too much to say
i can not express how disappointed in the poor design of this item to charge the battery was an incredible hassle at least amazon made it easy to return when we were n't happy
i am extremely disappointed in this product the blue light is obnoxiously bright the alarm comes on at a very high volume everytime regardless of where you set it the feedback from the ipod is unacceptable and the remote barely works to make matters worse i called customer service for the ilive and they wo n't refund my purchase price because it is operating as designed '' apparently they are aware of the fact that the alarm turns on very loud and that there is feedback from the ipod according to them that was how it was originally designed and manufactured therefore operating as designed '' however they assured me that the design team is taking this criticism into account when they design the next model ''
the sound is much better than other ipod satellite speakers i have used but still substandard the blue backlight is way to bright it lights up the whole room it is impossible to read the time from any distance beyond a few inches the unit does not keep good time as well it has gained 8 minutes since i plugged it in two months ago the remote control function is great i love that i can hit snooze with the remote or even set enable the alarm
when docked the ipod just started to make a funny noise or scrolling through a title the radio makes funky noises out of the speakers that are really annoying that 's unnaceptable ! ! ! i returned next day then i got the ihome 5 works great !
awesome product if it worked well i have a generation ipod the ipod video when docked and playing a movie or scrolling through a title the radio makes funky noises out of the speakers that are really annoying i dislike that if i set the volume at 6 and wish that when the alarm goes off in the morning it would stay at volume 6 and not bump up to volume 15 which is quite loud and dont wish to wake everyone else up in the house just gets bad feedback off of all ipod functions and all i got it for christmas and i dont even use it it sits on my desk with a piece of paper covering the extremely bright blue screen with my ipod in it charging i use my cell phone for my alarm in the morning foxwel
this product has a buzzing sound that never goes away audio quality is really poor all of the extras do n't mean anything if the sound is bad
this is the worst thing never buy this one ! ! ! there is serious noise big
i had high hopes for this but three major flaws contributed to it being returned 1 the display is extremely bright i ended up covering it with a just to be able to get to sleep 2 even though bright the display can not be read unless you are close and at the correct angle 3 the sounds quality was surprisingly bad i knew this was n't a fancy expensive model but the sound was unbearably distorted especially at lower volumes you want your ipod music on in the background i though my ipod battery was dead at first but apparently the speakers on this unit are just that bad so it fails as a clock and as an ipod player i never tried the radio function but even if that was excellent it would not have saved the product from being returned
i would never buy this printer again it is great until you run out of ink then you can only use cannon the replacing of the chip only workls sometime to use other brand inks it was not conservative on ink at all and now they want 100 for replacement inks probably will never buy another cannon product agai
this printer produces lovely printouts but as noted above it uses far too much ink from expensive cartridges my biggest problem with it is that there seems to be no way to adjust its automatic feature i bought it to use as a scanner on a regular basis but i can not predict how much of any given document it will decide to chop off there is no apparent way to tell it what you want either i wish i 'd gotten a less expensive machine with a better user interface
very average quality speaker system too much noise even at low volumes even with highest recording quality files the volume is horribly noisy
i tried and tried to convince myself that this sounded good or even acceptable alas the sound was so muddy no matter what i did i set the eq on treble boost and i pressed the '' button on the unit still as muddy and muffled as could be besides that there was a terrible sound between tracks that reminded me of a cd player searching for the next track amazingly i never hear this sound when using the nano with headphones i am returning this and moving up another price point when searching for my next small speaker set
i am 31 years old every game system i ever bought still works and i still regularly use the first ever dvd player and vcr i ever bought my point is i take care of products i purchase so i can get years of use out of them within two weeks of purchasing these headphones the plastic that covers the slide bars broke on each side i dont have a big head and i never pull them apart more than needed within six months of purchase these headphones were broken into two pieces once the plastic covers broke it put stress on them even more until one side completely snapped in two i will say that while they lasted they never were uncomfortable even after 8 hour gaming sessions the sound is good and the mic worked well i had to give these headphones 2 stars for having a 6 month life expectancy
i 've had these for a few months you actually do get reasonable quality surround sound from the unit however as noted by several other reviewers there is constant crackling and hissing in the background and the microphone falls off frequently the noise get 's worse if you use your keyboard or mouse i 'm using a high quality sound card in a well grounded computer i used to put this computer 's sound through a home surround sound amplifier and it was whisper quiet so it 's not an issue on my end to customer support have gone unanswered bottom line it will give you surround sound if you are an audiophile the background noise will really annoy you it works for my purposes but they should cost 29 like the other mid range consumer headphones
i bought this travel alarm at target it was shoddy from the outset but for 10 i managed to use it despite the dim display and tinny alarm for one trip then i realized the battery only lasts a few weeks i would have spent more on batteries than the clock itself in the first year it also began to literally pull apart at the seams i mailed the clock to sharp 's corporate headquarters in nj with my complaint and received a letter back saying it was n't one of their products even though it clearly says sharp '' right on the front so either they are lying and producing terrible products or they are not protecting their trademark and allowing other companies to manufacture shoddy products and market them with the sharp name either way i could never buy a product with the sharp name on it again how could i ever be sure if it would be backed up by sharp or not
i was just called to a new client site last week that has 11 of these cameras installed of the 11 half at any given time will drop off the network lock up he was continually calling his exiting tech guy who performed the install to reset them and eventually called me in because he was n't getting in his own words what he paid for '' i 've used netstumlber and a few other apps to verify the wireless network health which in my opinion is very good at the farthest point i am still receiving 92 signal with a linksys router other devices on his network are problem free the issues are isolated to the cameras short of recommending the client box them and send them back for a refund i 've emailed dlink for any opinions or aftermarket fixes '' they are running the latest firmware i 've tried to pick a few up on to at least test them in a controlled environment but spending 400 per camera when there are obvious problems would not be something i would be willing to invest in it would be something i would be interested in since if they do work as promised i could recommend them to future clients my credentials officer and instructor cissp have a year networking business serving major brokerage houses in manhattan and have a smaller business auditing networks recommending network security and wireless solutions i will if dlink provides an actual solution aim is my username above if anyone has jumped this hurdle
i 'm on my second i sent the first one back because it was locking up all the time the replacement is also locking up i guess i 'll have to send it back too i would avoid this camera at least until they fix the problems when it works video quality and features are ok
camera is easy to set up video is of acceptable quality but sound quality is good however i can not utilize the microphone and sound monitoring feature from my office because my employer only allows http to get through the network i 'd highly recommend this camera however it just stopped panning after about 13 months of very light use that is tilting is still working but panning does not support is terrible because i could hardly understand the english spoken by tech support further tech support could n't help figure out what is wrong it seems that it will have to be sent in for repair and it will cost pretty pennies
the camera locks up many times it is certainly not for those who want this camera to be monitoring all the time the software is messy it goes to full screen mode and never comes back ideally when you are away you would be contrlling the pc through remote it is very difficult to control this from a remote location the software lacks the ability to auto detect the camera at startup the software is poorly written by by someone who has never been in this business dlink has no support at all please do n't waste money in this camera
when i received these slim cases 25 where damaged in shipment some broke when i opened them they are too thin to hold up for very long i will never buy them again
these jewel cases are not very good for music cds if you carry them around as i do they tend to pop out of their center holder and are liable to get scratched perhaps they are meant for storage purposes only
i received a box of these cases and about 20 out of 100 were broken upon arrival because they are so fragile if they are handled carefully they work well but the hinges are easily broken unfortunately not a lot of selection on amazon for this type of clear cd case
jewel cases are diffucult to open and are extremely fragile

as a dumb hard drive this is for more money than you need to spend the cruzersynch '' preloaded application has never been able to transfer the contact list from my outlook express it crashes everytime it 's also better to use synctoy from ms because cruzersynch only synchs deletes files deleted from the hd while synctoy has a contribute '' option that never deletes from the destination drive i contacted support '' i sent them the requested copy of my wab they 've been working '' on it for weeks i never expect to hear from them cruzersynch also without warning deleted my address book contacts from my hd not good
i bought this to use for updating a database inside an airplane the airplane equipment avionics requires that the usb drive be formatted fat '' i downloaded the uninstall app from and windows said the archive was corrupted i downloaded another app from sandisk but it did n't work either if it were bigger i could use it as a
i bought it thinking it will be a sturdy drive and lexar anyway had a good name in flash drives but to my utter dissapointment barely 2 months after use it started behaving funny it wo n't copy data 1 file more than mb while copying back more than data from this drive to my laptop it will hang and then computer will not be able to read it i tried with 3 laptops ! maybe it has bad sectors but its as good as a floppy disk for me now and i 'm using it only for sharing keeping small amount of data highly dissapointed
i have had the lexar sport drive for 2 years and loved it easy to use and worked like a charm until a few months ago when i began to get messages that told me the drive was full deleting files did n't help and i finally realized that instead of 256 mb of memory i had about 32 kb so something happened along the way and the drive is now useless i would not recommend this product
i bought this drive primarily to keep on my keychain and because the cap wrapped around the body and i would not have to worry abut loosing caps this worked well for about 2 months when after the normal wear and tear of taking my keys out of my pocket the cap popped at the point that conects to the key ring i say popped not broke because the cap is made out of material that i now realise is a glorified rubber band sport indeed i had to resort to keeping the drive loose in my pockets have long since lost the fragile thing and am now wishing i had the frustration of loosing caps for a drive that is sucurely attached to my key ring
do not buy this product i got this product as a cheap solution to play my ipod in my car i did n't want to spend 80 on a fm transmitter so i bought this instead worked fine for a few weeks ended up completely screwing up my cassette player it would always click and pop out eventually my radio started not working as a result this thing ended up shorting out my radio and nothing is functionable do n't get this product for a cheap solution you are much better off getting a docking fm transmitter that plugs through the cigarette lighter and charges your ipod make sure you actually spend the money on a good fm transmitter instead of going cheap and buying one of these things
bought this drive in september 2006. now instead of reading cd 's or dvd 's it only makes a clicking noise sony technical support is horrible buy another brand
i installed this drive and the machine recognized it unfortunately it will not read write or recognize any discs put into it it also emits horrible whining noises customer service was n't much help is n't there such a thing as inspecting products before they are packaged anymore
the old koskin design is great i have 5 and just logged on to order one for a friend and am quite disappointed to see the changes so my friend will be getting something else the way the old handle was attached was very cool a selling point plus the mesh in the handle made orderly labeling easy and attractive the old ' koskin material was pretty cool too if all this has changed find something else no reason to stick with case logic for average stuff you can get discount junk everywhere hope case logic reads this
i will admit that hands down case logic is the best cd wallets you can buy they are usually constructed with great quality and you actually feel that you get your money 's worth even the protection it provides for the cd 's that you put it in it is outstanding i 'm a scratch freak and i 've noticed that case logic wallets do not put any scratches on your cd 's or dvd 's not even those little really light ones that you only see in bright light nothing bad to say about them at all it was pretty much everything a cd wallet should be at it 's finest but ! new this year is the redesigned version of these wallets and they are terrible ! the previous models were superior to any other cd wallet out there now they have brown stitching put against black koskin leather the handle looks completely cheap and it comes from inside the wallet letting you know that there is no telling what is holding it in place the mesh screen in the handle is gone so no more labels can be placed in it they are seriously terrible and that 's all you can find when you go out shopping for one i found this out and quickly rushed to my favorite local electronic store and bought the last previous model 320 koskin cd wallet that i was lucky to find in the very back of the shelf the rest were the new ugly and cheaply made ones at the same price i bought that wallet just in case i needed it within the year and good thing i did because i needed it and now need another i 'm now out of space and in desperate need for a new cd wallet but i refuse to buy one of these new ones it does n't matter if you get the koskin leather which is my favorite or the fabric ones they are both repulsive in this years model so now i sit with old spool casings that used to hold all my blank cd 's now holding my real cd 's and dvd 's until case logic comes back into focus and sells a better quality and improved this time for real cd wallet this is pretty much everything that the previous 2 reviews say i just completely agree with everything they say and i 'm hoping that somebody from case logic or word gets out to the people and they notice a huge slump in their sales this year please case logic no more brown stitching poor quality handles and less features in your next model design of these wallets my fingers are crossed
it 's true cl has improved '' this product in the process they ruined it for one thing they removed several features for instance the new version does not have the removable fast file and lacks the slot for a label on the handle also it is about 30 lighter and obviously cheaper '' in many respects the sides are now lightweight nylon i would be surprised if one of these new models holds up for even 30 as long as the old one and it 's ugly brown stitching on black faux leather looks awful ! there is one actual improvement in the new one it was easier to open flat on a table and one possible improvement the attachment of the handle is apparently different but you ca n't really tell if it 's any better because it is hidden on the new one you ca n't blame amazon the new and the old one have the same upc code 8585405012 but they are different part numbers old 60 2233002 new i am disgusted with case logic for this crass and brazen attempt to squeeze a few pennies out of the production cost at the cost of huge loss of quality i 'm not going to touch any of their products again imo they can not be trusted
purchased this antenna to extend the range of my linksys compact wireless router made no difference at all ! tried to return but could not get a return authorization number from the vendor also i was surprised at the size of the antenna it was much bigger than i anticipated and did not fit in the space where i had the router located
i bought the for use with my linksys and at the same time bought the antenna pair for use with my linksys no improvement at all in signal quality and if anything quality has dropped pc is in room on second floor is across the hall behind two normal wooden interior doors prior to new antennas signal was in the mid now with the new ones i 'm in the mid low i was hoping for a rise into the these antennas might work for someone else but so far for my layout they 've been a waste of money i also bought the range extender which is n't here yet so hopefully once that arrives my signal quality will improve
i bought this to extend the range of my access point in my 1500 sq ft flat i had my access point at the far end of the house from where i wanted to connect some of the time this antenna made no difference i ended up moving my access point to resolve the problem
the antenna does not appear to add any range whatsoever to my wireless network i still ca n't get reception more than 40 away what a disappointment
i have owned many radios and purchased this received short wave stations and to get better reception for local stations this radio did neither this radio performed worse than a 10 cheapy radio which received station more easily and much clearer i returned this radio shortly after trying it what a waste ! do not buy this piece of junk
trusting to insightful reviewers here i purchased a grundig with a few clicks i supposed that my dad 's grundig of the 50 's would n't be dupiclated in a but all i wanted was quality reception and a nice sound my radio provides neither yes it 's a nicely finished set and all it 's options work that 's about the best of it my night stand holds a 10 sony clock radio that puts the grundig 's reception and sound quality to shame a standby battery operated radio is a must in south florida and this set will do that job nicely i had hoped for more
this is a poorly designed device and it does not work as advertised gave it 1 star since you can not give it 0 stars items that do not work as advertised 1 document feed chokes at more than 20 pages 2 double sided copying is a joke the lcd coaches you to manually turn over the pages this is not done automatically as is the case with most double sided copying 3 usb connection does not work with windows xp media edition 4 pc fax receive does not work with the network connection 5 tech support will eat hours of your time and produce no constructive results stay away from this product i purchased other brother products that i am satisfied with see my ratings but this is a total i 'm shocked since it was so highly rated by pc mag and cnet watch out ! ! !
in a nutshell if you own a mac do not buy this machine i struggled with brother 's tech support system several times to make it work with my ibook running os 10.4 and still have not been able to scan a thing i 've also begun having problems sending faxes as the machine eats the documents last time i had to send an important document i went to an office depot and paid to send it for fear of it being eaten by this machine buyer beware especially mac users
i bought an ihome along with a remote on amazon a month or two ago i f i had n't wanted the remote i could have payed about 15 or 20 dollars less and gotten one without it but after about a month of use my remote decided to stop first i thought the battery was dead so i tried a new battery did n't work i even used a voltage meter on both batteries and learned that both were completely full and functional i did n't drop the remote in any way that should have broken on it i did n't step on it spill anything on it or throw it across the room so i was rather upset when it stopped working and there no way i can really return it so now i want a remote but i 'm unsure if i should order another
this is the description for this item eforcity 's black aluminum case for apple ipod video models ipod video special edition this is not compactible for the video ipod ''
i have a pioneer inno and expected these to work based on the claim works with all radios '' but the packaging when it arrives says it is for myfi radios and it has different connectors the product page here does n't say delphi myfi it says which inno is sold as the product itself probably works fine for the sets it is designed for the 1 star is actually a complaint about the amazon product description
even though the inno is marketed as an radio and this item claims it works with all '' radios the connector does n't fit
this antenna does not give me any better signal than the one that came with my radio not worth the money
this product is unstable i have spent numerous hours on the phone with belkin tech support to no avail one time they left me on the phone on hold for over three 3 hours i need to pack these items up and mail them back or to belkin gladwin baile
well first off i 'm not sure if it 's the card or the router itself but ever since i installed the new serious wireless in my home i have had nothing but problems and poor connectivity they clam that the has extended range i went back to my pre n wireless and got twice the range and way better reliebility then with the the concept seems good and the descriptions are great but i ca n't say i feel the product is what they say it is
i have windows xp home edition and i installed the wireless adapter software with no problems however after buying both the new belkin n router and adapter at the same time i was unable to connect the adapter to my wireless connection the adapter would n't even recognize my connection the few times it miraculously found the connection and connected the service would last seconds at best i called tech support and after spending 30 minutes on the phone they were unable to help establish a connection and i eventually returned the adapter however as the other reviewers have mentioned the belkin n router works perfectly i have had no problems connecting it to my other older wireless adapter
i bought the belkin wireless router and this notebook card in the hopes of obtaining a usable signal several rooms away from the router the router worked flawlessly and the notebook card gave me a weak intermittent signal where i wanted to use it this was however an improvement over my previous linksys wireless router that gave me no signal at all at this location after about an hour of use i got the 'blue screen of death ' on my new dell dual core laptop that warned that a serious error occurred and windows was halted to prevent further damage it further warned that if i recently installed new hardware i should reboot and uninstall the hardware i rebooted windows came back and i uninstalled the notebook card i called belkin tech service to report the problem but the rep just kept trying to get me to reinstall the card nope too risky i 'll return the card by the way when you install the card windows warns that the product is not windows logo certified belkin 's instructions state that you should ignore this warning and install anyway i hope belkin addresses the issue with a firmware update and gets windows logo certification
i tried my picturemate for the first time last night and it malfunctioned almost immediately it claims that it has a paper jam but it does n't i 've tried pushing ok '' to clear it as suggested but this does nothing it still insists it 's jammmed and refuses to operate i 've tried the suggested troubleshooting '' to no avail so i 'm now on hold for an estimated sixteen minutes with the epson support center all of this hassle for a brand new fussy appliance makes me wish i 'd gone with another brand the few pictures i got out of it looked very good but the macine took a few minutes to print each one so even when it 's working the machine is still flawed i would strongly suggest another brand
upon my first use of this cute little flash drive it broke the yellow cover broke off and would n't go back on i would not recommend it i returned it
i workout regularly and vigorously and thought an armband holder for my mini would be better than the included belt clip i was wrong the neoprine is supposed to keep the moisture out but after three uses my mini was slightly damp also on some machines ab crunch the armband got in my way i went back to the belt clip and am much happier these things are pesonal though so this product may work for others i also want to note that amazon is letting me return the item no shipping cost and no questions asked that 's good customer service
these speakers are barely audible so not worth the money they sound like you 're listening to a speaker out of a soda can i would never but them again
the cover to the slot for the card broke the day very weak hinges and door is in an area that is most likely to get grabbed when using it
simpletech claims that this reader is mac compatible but it freezes up my mac os with every attempt to use it i have two other card readers that work perfectly on my mac with the same sd cards inside them simpletech tech support tells me that they never tested this reader with lexar sd cards because they 're not one of the bigger card makers '' makes me question how serious they are about determining compatibility
cheaper to go to radio shack or most stereo stores and get exactly what you want of equal quality at a lower price
likely discontinued because i bought this on sale at frys for only 4.99 it was worth that price like the other reviewer said it dominates the electrical receptacle even a four plugger becomes hard to use radio sounds very tinny but works it picks up the local am stations i have it on the wall in a workshop where the nicely lit digital clock comes in handy one problem i noticed was that there is a loud hum when i played the radio while it was plugged in nothing else active on the line i got around this by clipping a thin ground wire to the outside antenna this seemed to also boost am reception
i bought this headset for my daughter at christmas they sounded great and she loved them but after about 8 weeks of use she quit using them she showed me that the speaker part pulled out of the band after examining them i see that it is all plastic and the wire rides in a little grove on the inner side of the band when the speaker part pops out the wire become the support and the whole thing just dangles around your neck i was very disappointed with the workmanship of this product and would not recommend them
the website describes the inputs for this speaker as including an lfe input but the speaker i received does not have an lfe input the manual i received with the speaker depicts a separate input labeled lfe in unfiltered '' but there is no such input on the back of the speaker update when i complained about this they sent me another one it too does not have an lfe input so now i have two speakers that do not live up to the description on this website i am reluctant to complain again because these damn things are big and heavy
polk makes great speakers lsi series good speakers rti series ok speakers monitor series and mediocre speakers r series but like most speaker manufacturers their subs are horrible for the money why because they are betting that if you are already buying their speakers you 'll likely want to buy one of their subs too especially if some slimey ignorant salesperson tells you that you must match '' the sub and speakers of course those of us who know something about audio know that aside from a few rare exceptions like magnepan planar speakers which really require a musical subwoofer there is absolutely no such thing as '' get the sub you can afford the best buck subs are made by the two dominant subwoofer specialists hsu and svs this is a prime example if you are in a small room and listening to jazz or rock music it 's not too bad use it while blasting or watching a loaded movie like jurassic park '' or fellowship of the ring '' and you wo n't even know it 's there simply does not go low enough nor loud enough let 's not even talk about if it 's clean enough to do the job the only worse subs i 've ever heard would be the sony and yamaha subs the infinity subs are slightly better for this price range you can do much better looking at the 12 '' dayton subwoofer from partsexpress dot com which goes for under a hundred fifty dollars shipped
i bought these speakers for my emac as an upgrade to the two built in speakers they are in fact much worse than the built in speakers they are about as loud which mind you is pretty low in terms of bass i could not imagine worse speakers i 'm not really sure how creative could even sell these for the price i paid 35 anyway just really dont buy them there guaranteed to be worse than whatever speakers you are currently using
i think this is a very bad wireless mouse it did n't work wireless for me even though i charged the battery for more than 4 hours according to the manual so i had to connect the recharging cable with it all the time that makes it a wired mouse ! ! ! the buttons on the receiver and mouse are so tiny that you have to use a pen or something to press it the battery cover is hard to open this mouse does not have a sensitive signal the motion of the cursor lags behind your mouse terrible mouse ! !
i had to buy a new one and i chose another brand logitech this time there is no button so the batteries run out if you do n't take them out i think the buttons are pressed during transportation now the battery contacts are not functioning properly and i had the same problem described in a recent review i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen ''
mouse movement is extremely slow it literally takes 10 ! seconds to get from one side of the screen to another i just got it from officedepot buttons are too small and hard to control joystick is unresponsive
i wish i read the reviews before i bought this thing unfortunately extremely user unfriendly to connect and disconnects itself often kills batteries even in sleep mode the size and precision is good when it does work but definitely not worth the money i exchanged it for a new one thinking it was just the first unit but still terrible
do not buy this may be the worst product i 've ever bought it has never worked properly i 've kept fresh batteries in it but it 's still no good within 10 feet of the laptop i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen awful product believe the bad reviews it 's worse than they describe the only positive thing i can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy my cat loves the laser pointer
do not buy this mouse ! this mouse has given me nothing but frustration 1. the front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time 2. battery life is horrible like 2 weeks 3. when your mouse is idle for 8 minutes it goes into an automatic sleep mode the manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to revive '' it but when i do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen so i have to reboot my computer absolutely the worst ! !
i own a sony vaio computer in the computer there are no ports to put in this cord ended up buying something for money to convert it to a usb connection then i could n't find a program that would be able to send and receive data to my etrex gps via a usb port was definitely a hassle
the quality of this cable is fine but it does n't give you access to the power pins that are in the garmin interface get the cable that does power and data instead or if you 're a hardware geek then make your own with the stuff from purple open projects
i just gladly replaced this printer this was not a good printer experience for my husband and the plastic parts were cheap and broke easily after a few months the printer display said that there was a paper jam and never stopped saying there was a printer jam for a year and there was not this rendered the faxing function useless do n't buy this printer it is n't good there are many other solid printers on the market that outshine this cheaply made machine
at first i was very pleased with this printer after a few months i kept getting a carriage jam '' error i have no jams buj to reset the printer takes some cumbersome effort i got online and learned that this is a common and known problem with this printer shop around the printer is great except these carriage jams '' appear out of nowhere and for no reason a glitch and it takes up to five minutes to reset the printer to work again good printer until it jams
if you do n't mind an installation taking about an hour and a half the installation was much faster on our xp except that after four tries and a conversation with tech support i could n't get the hp software to run the fax software xp has fax software so there 's a workaround but i 'm not paying over a hundred dollars for software that i ca n't install since our old separate scanner copier and fax were working and we got the old fax to work better with a new answering machine than the 6210 we 'll just return it and yes we also noticed the small ink cartridges
maybe it 's just the one i got but my hdmi port seems to be very unreliable most of the time it will be working fine but once in a while for no reason the screen goes black and stays black for an extended period of time if i switch back to using component cables it works immediately but the picture with component cables always looks noticeably worse i have tried connecting it to my cable box with 2 different hdmi cables and connecting it to two different computers with a dvi to hdmi cable the same thing happened each time so i do n't think it was the cable or the source of the hdmi input that had any problems so basically i 'm stuck watching it with component video which does not look very good
this television performed admirably for 7 months great picture and good sound now it begins to whistle '' more and more loudly after being on for one hour it needs to be shut off allowed to rest then can be used for another short while after 90 days any labor must be paid for out of one 's own pocket and any tv repair person will charge at least 80 to just come take a look you do get what you pay for i got a nice tv for 14 a month for 7 months ! if you can afford something a little better it is worth getting something that is better quality
mono sound how do you get you rca cables from the dvd player to work after about 5 hours of use the edges all around the screen are a green a purple hue for a few inches inward ! thanks god for customer service we 're sending it back and paying almnost twice as much for a tv
my problem is not with the tv it was fantastic when it worked but 36 days into owning it the picture went out completely and the tv has now become a very expensive paperweight what 's the problem well amazon wo n't exchange it because it was 6 days past their policy and sony well they 've sent out an authorized '' repair person who has proceeded to strip half the screws that hold the tv together and despite replacing everything but the panel its still not working sony 's solution keep me on hold and force me to have a new panel installed in a 36 day old tv ! ! ! they refuse to replace the entire tv with a new one and are telling me that i am screwed '' i suggest you buy this tv from a local retailer at least then you have somewhere to go when everyone treats you like 2000 is nothing not really amazon 's fault but they have n't been the most customer friendly '' sony warranty service is not worth the picture quality of this

the cartridge gives you about pages of print the gives you about page of print for only about 4 dollars more in price ! the costs about 33.5 cents per page printed the costs about 12 cents per page printed why would anyone buy the cartridge and pay almost as much per page of print where i work i made sure our supply folks order only the cartridges
i too received the lower capacity instead of the promised four times ! three by amazon and once by target no amount of explanation by me could persuade them to check that large '' on the package see my image above before boxing it and mailing it to me on the fifth attempt by phone amazon simply refused to try again yet as of today the product is still offered for sale at the attractive 71.99 price
i was happy with my original stylus but the replacement does not fit snugly inside the silo turning the pda upside down causes the stylus to fall out i 've dropped the stylus six times in only two days it 's only a matter of time until i lose it i am a very unhappy customer and will seek some other replacement pen my pda was replaced by palm and may be defective i can not be certain that the problem i cite above is due to the stylus rather than the pda itself
the replacement stylus is terrible much lower quality than the original stylus that comes with the ld the replacement telescoping top is too loose and thus wiggles around a lot in your hand and it does n't extend and retract smoothly into the barrel i would rather get a stock ld stylus than get 3 of these replacements
i 've never submitted a review before to amazon but this case annoyed me so much i thought i 'd write to pass on this warning first if you are using the player you ca n't close the case because the area above the headphones jack is not cut out second you have to slide the case out to reach the switch because the fabric hides that switch the case is soldly made and does n't appear cheap it 's just not especially convenient but you would n't know it unless you tried it i did and now i 'm looking for a better one
this is my third dymo labelwriter this time i bought their combo label and tape strips of adhesive labels usually plastic coated printer when my tape printer died big mistake i use some special symbols and fonts the label portion does n't pass my formatting on from office word the tape editor is really hard to use if you have any special symbols something as simple as making the text bold changes everything to symbols not even from the symbol font i was using worse if you labor hard enough to construct a tape and print it you will have all your formatting stripped away when you save if all you do is print labels and tapes it is probably an okay printer the label printer seems okay but tape printer jams now and then but not too often every 25 to 50 print operations since dymo has only offered the most inane support to many requests for aid i will not buy a dymo product again i 'll try brother probably
the one and only reason i purchased this label printer was for the highly touted dymo stamps feature supposedly giving you the ability to print your own postage stamps onto thermal postage labels for no monthly fee only the cost of the printer and the thermal label refills according to the dymo stamps website dymo stamps gives you the ability to print exactly the amount of postage you need '' and eliminate the need for costly postal meters '' what the consumer is not told upfront is that these precise '' amounts of postage can only be in denominations of the dymo stamps software 's choosing not any amount you want in fact the only postage denominations that can be printed are those already available in stamp form at the post office basically just your 0.39 stamps 4.05 priority mail stamps and postcard stamps this software also does not give you the capability to print postage for parcel post media mail or express mail and does n't allow you to add additional postage for services like insurance or certified mail at all how this saves you any trouble over buying stamps from the post office is beyond me conveniently you can only overcome all of these limitations by subscribing to endicia dymo stamps ' backbone provider for a monthly fee heck you ca n't even go to an office supply store to buy the thermal postage label refills that you need to print postage on they can only be ordered online through a link in the dymo stamps software especially given the fact that even the least expensive dymo stamps capable labelwriter model is over 100 this will not save you any money in postage will not save you any time and ordering stamps online from usps or getting them from the local post office is just as convenient if not more convenient than ordering the stupid thermal refills online from dymo and waiting for them to arrive thankfully amazon is great at accepting returns
i never had a chance to use the dymo labelwriter duo becuase it would not install and run with mac osx or help desk personnel were very polite and professional but could not figure out how to get the labelwriter to install
midi uno yamaha keyboard buy the simple mat
i finally got my uno to work with my yamaha keyboard yes that 's right i have a yamaha keyboard here 's how i did it i installed the drivers before i plugged in the usb device strangely the uno was not using drivers even though the hardware wizard looked like it figured everything out correctly i checked device manager to see if the drivers were installed correctly they were not to get into device manager 1. i on my computer then clicked on properties 2. clicked on the hardware tab 3. clicked on the device manager button 4. clicked on the plus sign next to sound video and game controllers 5. on usb audio device '' if you have usb uno driver in the list do n't go any further your drivers are fine though you may want to update them as of it is version 6. clicked on the driver tab then clicked on the update driver button 7. clicked on the install from a list or specific location advanced '' radio button then clicked next 8. clicked on do n't search i will choose the driver to install '' radio button then next 9. the usb uno midi driver should be in the compatible hardware list you will have to select it otherwise it will use microsoft 's generic drivers click next 10. you will get a scary message about the software you are installing has not passed windows logo testing to verify its compatibility with windows xp yada yada just click continue anyway '' 11. if all goes right your usb audio device '' will change to usb uno driver '' or audio usb uno midi driver '' or both yes i got it to work but for to have me go through these steps is unconscionable the drivers should install without fuss this is not a true plug and play '' device not even a plug and pray '' device it 's just stupid giving 2 stars is generous for those who gave 4 or 5 stars maybe you have a mac or maybe you just live right but this is not a great product even though it now works there are some latency problems press a piano key hear the sound a couple of miliseconds later and it sounds a bit muddy i can live with that muddy sound latency issues but a bad install experience does not make me want to purchase an product in the future cheers
this item will not work if you have a yamaha keyboard the people at the company were very nice to deal with but their product just wo n't work with a yamaha keyboard there was a constant low humming noise that showed up at a low note on the music notation software i us
amazon should let us give 0 stars too SMILE i paid 43 for it brand new from a place that will accept returns i 'm returning it it is the only usb device i have ever had that keeps falling asleep the usb green led keeps going out and i have no midi signal i 'm using it in windows 2000. like i said it is the only usb device i have ever had that will not stay alive like it should when it falls asleep i have to do the windows unplug or eject hardware '' thing then unplug the uno 's usb cable and replug it that wakes it up but i never know if it will stay awake for 30 seconds or 2 hours one thing to know about spending money on an item designed this way if you accidentally damage any of these cables attached to this blue circuit box you lose the whole device these cables can not be unplugged repaired or replaced get a box where every cable can be unplugged instead
i could n't tell whether the phones were any good because the housing made the headphones sound like i was listening inside a cardboard box hollow terrible sound i do n't mean terrible compared to top quality headphones i mean terrible compared to what you get with your average walkman
i had a pair of jensen headphones that were similar to these that got worn out and broke on the side wish i remembered the model but they 're long gone in the trash so i thought i 'd get another pair of jensens because the others sounded great boy was i wrong these headphones sound like complete garbage the treble is horrible the bass is horrible everything these are worse than the trashy earbud style headphones i got with my player pay a few extra bucks and buy something else because you 'll end up trashing these and getting something else anyway like i did
do n't know how this could work with on sportrak and not another but it will definately not work with the sportrak color the back of the unit is smaller than the meridan series and is too small to lock into place and even if it were large enough the locking mechanism wo n't match
i made two data dvds and used the hp lightscribe discs i was n't very pleased with the outcome either the pictures were dull and not very clear to the person who gave it 5 stars do n't think i do n't know what i was checked all the color contrast from best to normal picked what i wanted and the print still came out bad i will be trying something else because the hp dvds are n't worth the money
it really is n't worth the extra money to pay for lightscribe cds when you do use lightscribe it does even look good it is very faint and the writing is very small just use a label
here is why it is junk 1. creates a buzz on the line 2. not enough room in back of phone for the cord if you wall mount 3. the lcd is pathetic ca n't see it in a normally lit room this should be back lit and numbers should be bigger 4. all in all a real dissappointment and it is going back
i have to agree with everyone two lines are very nice but the lack of a mute button makes this phone unusable for conference calls unfortunately i am going to have to replace it with another phone that has two lines and a mute button fatal design flaw lack of a lighted message waiting indicator light '' is also a big drawback but there is a faint message waiting indicator on the lcd
no mute button is n't that illegal how about having to drill down menu after menu to just to turn off the ringer otherwise the phone works great and sounds great but these are biggies to me
i bought this guitar about a year ago hoping to just learn the basics of playing when i first brought it home i did n't stop playing for days though it eventually got boring playing i tried to learn how to play from the enclosed book but the book goes to fast and it 's just too hard for any beginner such as me to learn the strings are a fairly big issue the thin strings break often as for any guitar but the thicker ones break more than they should they only give you one extra string so when my second string broke i had to take it to a shop to get some more they asked me if they could look at it i let them after visualizing it they said that it was a crappy guitar so if you are just a beginner or are just looking for some fun then this guitar is okay though if you are serious about playing go to a local kennaly keys or yamaha they have good deals there and quality instruments i 've gotten my drum set there and my brother got his base guitar there and we love em ! please consider what i said
installed it to my nissan xterra first it was working fine but after a few months the channel switching knob stopped working twists free but the channel number remains 1 making the whole thing kompletely useless
my 10 dollar portable panasonic radio has better and clearer reception than this overpriced crap even if the radio is by my window reception is static and horrible do n't fall for the grunding name like i did you can get a high quality shortwave radio for much less panasonic makes one for 40 bucks ! ! ! amazon also carries that awesome panasonic portable for less then 10 bucks i feel ripped off by grundig boycott this crap
the item was not as it was stated to be which was a disappointment for use in any vehicle it does not have a suction cup mount it must be fasten with screws i made use of in one car do to not being sent what i ordered as listed in desrciption most likely not buy another product richar
i bought this cable to connect an hp laptop running xp to an hp laserjet printer xp did not recognize the cable as new hardware i tried to install manually using the install new hardware feature but that did n't work either i finally bought a belkin cable about twice the price and it worked like a charm
this card was very good about 4 years ago if you do n't know much about computers and you 're looking to get a friend a gift or trying to buy a cheap video card listen to this there is no such thing as a good cheap video card the hardware demands for modern games are so high they require constant upgrading of hardware so if you 're looking to keep up with pc games you 're waisting your money unless you invest in the best video card you can can get pricey though it is well worth the investment do n't let this card fool you sure it has 256 mb memory but that 's just bait this card is slower than my old ati 9000 which only has 64 mb of memory
i am not sure what protection an ipod has but difference between standard usb and potential is huge only the ipod cable is useful from all this package and do not be fooled by the low marked price sales will charge handling and shipping '' so the bottom price will not be cheap if anyone in san francisco area wants the wall adapter without the usb cable it is yours for free but you will have to pick it up
i can not review this item since i have not received it so far at the shipping address i gave amazon when i did the purchase i bought four items and i only got two of them by mail what happened to the other two items ipod usb travel kit with car charger travel adapter cable purchased on stereo in ear ear plugs the spark plug purchased on who
i do n't like blueproton because they sent me a defective item and i have to pay the return shipping fee i like amazon because they refund me whole the payment otherwise blueproton would not refund me the shipping fee which is more expensive than the price of item
i am a student in a technology high school and when i saw that this bag would fit my laptop and what looked like room for my books i was in for a shock initially it was fine but after a month or so of use a small hole began to form which recently formed into a large hole now the whole handle part of the bag is coming off it is a good bag but it is poorly designed for any student in my opinion who needs to carry both a laptop and a large number of text books
space and pockets are great but it 's not at all durable my first pack ripped out a seam on my first trip using it i returned it hoping it was just a defect the replacement lasted a couple months i 'll return this one too but not for another wenger
my administrative assistant picked this up for me for use at work the first one never accepted or recognized the ink cartridges so it got sent back the second one started out ok with nice photo prints etc however it started skipping a line on most prints and it began periodically giving an error message and locking up in it got so bad that i would have the error once a day at least and i took to simply sending my prints to a community after having the marginally functional printer on my desk for a few weeks i decided that i will no longer use a canon
straight off when this printer detects that you 've an ink cartridge it refuses to perform any further head alignments even though there is plenty of paper in the tray and you 've been printing ok only seconds before it throws a no paper error when a head is attempted yet if you try and print again it suddenly thinks there is paper in the tray not only that but once it detects a refill it automatically your print heads to teach you a lesson for not using canon ink ! putting it simply if it detects you 're filling up the ink yourself it your print head and refuses to try and realign them that in anyone 's book is a dirty trick you 'll find that most printer manufacturers are now pulling tricks like this as a response to a growing number people choosing to their own cartridges purely for financial reasons they sell the printers cheap enough but my word they make the price of the printer back over and over again with the price they charge for the ink a study has shown that if you actually remove the liquid from the ink which is basically cheap solvent the remaining residue costs the user more than gold weight for weight ! what a con ! appart from that it prints very well indeed
i decided to risk the purchase based on previous reviews i got it and it seemed like it would be fine the vcr portion worked beautifully audio and video the dvd portion 's audio was fine but the video never worked all i saw was jagged lines across the screen would not recommend this product
i purchased this based on the fact that it was n't the most expensive one and it was n't the cheapest either as soon as i took it out of the box i was unhappy it is a featherweight it does not play any of my vhs tapes that i had previously taped on my old vcr the tracking is off and you ca n't fix it manually i dislike the remote the control buttons for which unit you are controlling are hard to find buried in the middle of the all the buttons there is no volume control or easily identifiable tracking buttons on the remote the stop button is also the rewind button and it kept doing the opposite of what i was trying to make it do the channel changing number buttons are small and not easy to use because of their low position on the remote overall i was quite unhappy with my purchase and am taking it back to the store
the previous model the 101 was an excellent pair of headphones that would only set you back about ten dollars sony replaced the 101 with the 110. the 110 has the same good quality sound as the previous model but it is smaller even standing still the headphones slip off of my ears causing me to constantly adjust them i do n't know if it is the smaller size or angle of the headset but the fact that it wo n't stay on my head makes it totally worthless i have many other kinds of headphones and have never run into this problem before so it is a faulty design not the shape of my head i would stay away from this model
these headphones bang into your head with the music i guess that might be cool but the sound fades in and out and you look like a moron with headphones banging into your head you can turn off the brain shaking '' feature but the sound quality is still poor and they are really really uncomfortable
my company communications purchsed 2 's through amazon to provide a to connect two locations via the open internet using a bench setup with the 's connected through a hub the shut down after about 5 minutes requiring me to power cycle both 338 's to restart a web search showed that others have encountered this and related problems the netgear web site suggests a command line procedure to change the timeout values i did as suggested it had no effect i really would like to give it zero stars
overall the product is decent handles load well the main problem is getting support for the vpn portion i have numerous calls in and have bounced around the support queue for some time when i have a few hours free i will try again until then no vpn for me
i would not buy this router as i am on my second one from netgear and it still having issues this router will not stay up and it drops the internet connection every day please buy something else or you 're be sorry like i am
ever wonder how many amazon product reviews are submitted by corporate shills in the case of the i 'm ready to guess it 's about 85 okay i 'm not totally serious serious in that estimate i 'm just disappointed in the product i 'm not a gamer and perhaps that 's why the did n't work for me i like to download tv programs via bittorrent i download whole seasons at a time which runs into the multiple gigabytes as you other bittorrent enthusiasts may know the average home network router has a tendency to freeze when bt pulls too many connections through it i find it very depressing to get up in the morning or come home from work and find that my downloads stopped short many hours ago for some months now i 've been in search of an affordable router to avoid this problem considering what i 've spent so far perhaps i would 've been better off to buy something expensive and capacious from the start in any case it 's difficult to derive any sort of consensus about router efficacy from the web there probably are more than a few lying corporate shills floating around cyberspace but mostly there are people who report good or bad results without taking into account operating system exact router model broadband type bittorrent client or the size of the torrents they download i was mildly excited to find so many positive amazon reviews for the perhaps i thought a router built for gaming would account for connection issues similar to bittorrent 's right about now the cognescenti reading this little tale of woe are probably laughing their butts off let me cut to the chase here after i hooked up the and started two bt downloads one a mere 1.5 g the other 22 g everything looked fine for about three hours then the silly thing froze on me as happened with the linksys and netgear routers wired and wireless i 've tried i obtained the latest firmware for it january 11 2006 installed this and tried again the results were similar except that now i noticed the router freezing on me even during regardless of my bittorrent client azureus utorrent bitcomet or its settings the results did n't improve if you 're a gamer maybe you 'll roll the dice on the if you 're a bittorrent enthusiastic such as myself you should probably keep looking
this is a very nice printer and a good upgrade from an inkjet printer it is fast quiet and produces good results however it lacks a vista driver so it no longer works with my upgraded vista computer hp is really dragging their feet on providing a driver
i like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running vista hp will not be releasing the drivers until july of this year so if you want to print now and not wait six months and you 've already upgraded to vista i recommend getting a different printer hopefully hp will get the message and release some drivers vista has been in beta for a long time so i find this delay to be inexcusable
not a bad printer i like the quality of print but as said elsewhere very expensive to maintain ink cartridges do n't last long and are as far as i can tell more expensive
i got the printer only to find that it does n't come with a cord to connect it to your computer after wasting my time going to three different places the cheapest one was for 50 amazon 's advertisement that this is free '' with the purchase of a camera is misleading to say the least as it 's not honest about the extra you have to spend just for a connecting cord in my opinion this has been very frustrating and a total ripoff !
it was bulky and if needed to be plugged into a computer
i have this printer in my office and am considering replacing it with an epson i has a lot of espcially for the price direct input from a camera or a memory card but it is very slow and noisy the print quality is very as are most ink jet printers in this price range but it is very slow and noisy did i say slow and noisy
i own a brother so of course i have to use this toner cartridge but if i had a choice i 'd try someone else 's the problem is always the same after a few months of great printing and btw i print maybe a couple dozen sheets a week if that a vertical line develops down the left side of every page about of an inch from the paper 's edge do n't bother with tech support they 'll tell you to clean the corona wire and drum which i did a million times to no avail eventually i gave up went out and purchased another cartridge and voil problem solved for another couple of months anyway and then you have to trash the old cartridge which as you 'll be able to tell from shaking it still has a heavy load of toner left in it great little printer lousy little cartridges suppose that 's how they make their money though
this may be a perfectly good phone and i 've had great success with other uniden products but amazon 's specifications for this product describe it as headset compatible '' this phone has no headset jack and is most definitely not headset compatible since i require a headset you can imagine how happy i am with this product
this was the first it what seems to be an endless quest for a good working radio it was hard to get the stations in and those that did come in where kind of fuzzy it did n't seem to work well when joggin like the stations would fade in and out from the bouncing i 'm not sure what the deal was i spent 10 on it but after a while the 10 here and there is making me look foolish
not practical i thought that i would have good fm reception but it is hard to tune
this item was working fine for about one month then it stopped functioning my computer and several others i tried as a double check '' could no longer read from the device very disappointing
four months after purchase the receiver misfunction and shut down it was impossible to contact sherwood electronics which had no service centers in the state of wisconsin therefore the warranty was not worth the piece of paper it was written on check out a sherwood service center in your state prior to purchase
it has been 15 years since i last shopped for a stereo receiver and back then there were certain features that all receivers came with regardless of how basic or inexpensive the model was well i took for granted that they all still came with these basic features and i was wrong i just purchased the sherwood and it does not have the tape monitoring feature it has tape input and output jacks but it does n't have the monitoring feature that lets you listen to the tape deck 's output while you are recording if you press the tape button the receiver switches away from the input source you are trying to record from ! the tape monitor function is also necessary for the use of an equalizer it baffles me that they are still giving you tape in and out jacks but do n't give you the proper switching for monitoring i guess they figured they could save a few pennies by leaving out this function since the demand for tape decks has declined in recent years unfortunately there are those of us who still like to use an eq to customize the sound to our environment even if we are no longer recording on tape i have found it difficult to verify whether or not a receiver has this function since the specs and features list usually never mentions it if they have a good picture of the unit you can look to see if there is a button that says tape monitor '' just looking for tape in and out jacks will not help because as i mentioned above the has these jacks but no monitor function then there are some models that have monitoring even though the switch only says tape '' the best way to know for sure is to try out the unit first but this is not practical when shopping online i have even gone so far as to go to the manufacturer 's website and download the instruction manual if the section on tape connections and recording does n't mention monitoring '' it probably does n't have it also many models no longer have phono input but this is easy to check just by looking at a good picture of the unit the also lacks an auxillary ac jack on the back of the unit not a big deal but a consideration if you have an outlet strip already filled up by other components another thing i noted that is worth mentioning is that many newer models such as this one have volume control knobs that do not have any position indicators or scale markings on them so be sure to turn down the volume before you turn off the unit or you could be in for a surprise when you turn it back on again ! if you do n't intend to use an eq and do n't need phono input the is probably a good inexpensive starter model the sound seemed fine and it had plenty of power for my application the tuner did seem to have a weak sensitivity some local fm stations came in with a lot of static in my research i have found the teac models and as well as onkyo models and all have tape monitoring capabilities as well as phono input
this is the third delphi product i have purchased for use with xm system each delphi product had to be returned because of problems sound card problem antenna connection would not maintain contact with signal etc the sound was very good when the systems were working the purpose of buying the portable units was to use the outside of the home i gave up on the portable systems and now have the home kit for connection to my home stereo system so far so good i have had it and working one week
though i rated it 1 star i 'd give it none if that were an option i really do n't like to write negative reviews but i feel other parents need to be warned when a product is n't worth the price of shipping much less the price itself i thought this would make a fun practice piano for my three year old son he began piano lessons recently and needs to practice the fingering motions on the keyboard i wanted something small with few bells and whistles and thought this little keyboard would be perfect for practicing piano fingering i put 6 fresh batteries in it when it arrived it does not come with the ac adaptor as mentioned in the instruction manual and turned it on for about 3 seconds there is a fairly nice song after that it gets garbled and makes a horrid static sound i poured over the instructions to figure out what i was doing wrong nowhere is it mentioned that it should be making this garbled static no matter what button you press the worst part is it will probably cost me more to ship it back than i 'll get for a refund this is an utter piece of junk and a waste of plastic never again will i buy an item that has n't been reviewed on save your money be willing to spend a bit more and find a better keyboard frankly i ca n't believe would sell this product or not at least test it before selling it
i purchased these batteries to use in my automatic car door locks and they worked for about a day i tried to use them in both of my clickers and had no luck
my son loved making lots of noise on this guitar but the amp no longer works after only a few months and now he ca n't use it all i would not recommend this product
this guitar sucks do n't be mad that 's just what i'v heard in these reveiws but of what i'v heard i would not waste money on this i would more likely get another one i'v seen it 's item number is 638760 and it 's really nice and has good reveiws and read this from from the manufacturer the deluxe electronic guitar is 31 '' in length it has 1 pick guard output jack for external amplifier 2 additional strings 1 single coil pickup amplifier with 5 watt output and strap volume control tone control switch input jack headphone jack dc jack 10 feet cable carrying strap and carrying case and it 's the same price as this one i do n't know if it 's just me but i would not buy this for a and i am a kid so i know what kids like and i really want this other one for christmas so that might be just me but i do n't kno
i purchased this guitar for my young boys the strings do n't stay in tune long enough to tune them all together i put lighter strings and new tuners on it but that did not help i did n't expect much but it should at least be able to be tuned
i think this guitar is horrible i mean it looks so bad also the make looks like its 100 yearss old
parents i teach guitar do not buy this item it is poorly made and if u want your kids to learn guitar you can get reduced size real guitars for the same price as this first off the amps built into the guitar and if your kid turns it up very loud it blows up and youll have nothing but static and more than likely your kid will second off it doesnt stay in tune very well this is the exact same guitar with amp built in nonsense toys r us had 15 years ago u want my advice for 89 bucks u can get your kid a real guitar with a reduced size like the epiphone les paul juniors they sell here on amazon or even get your kid a fullsized kramer focus for 79 dollars also sold here on amazon and u can get practice amps for 20 bucks that wont blowup when u turn it up both the lespaul junior and kramer are light weight but quality built it depends if u want a toy buy this cause this is a toy but if u want your kid to learn guitar this is not the best option and kids really dont need reduced size guitars ive taught 6 year olds and 60 year olds guitar and they were able to use a full size guitar and once they get a little older they can have a guitar they can still use trust me u wont be playing this guitar when u get 13 or 14 and want a band the tiny amp built in is about as loud as a pin dropping i had 1 of these when i was a kid it broke a year later my mom bought me a memphis strat copy for 20 bucks at a garage sale at first its full size intimidated me but i kept at it and now 15 year later im compared to stevie ray vaugn and im a professional guitar instructo
i 've tried this tape on three different makes of vhs decks and they all reject it check your manual about cleaning before purchasing a cleaning tape
the first i owned worked extremely well for about 2 years after it began to fail i purchased 2 more one of the two never worked consistently and failed completely in about a month the other failed in about 4 months of light use even inexpensive remotes should last longer
the remote would be fine except it will not allow you to punch through '' the volume to your receiver only your tv this makes the whole thing pretty useless our home theater like almost everyone 's uses our surround theater for sound why you ca n't punch through the volume controls to it is completely baffling i did a web search and it 's apparently baffling to everyone else as well back to the store it goes ! utterly worthless
i bought this remote with hopes of consolidating down to just one remote initially i was able to get my tv dvr dvd and vcr to all work flawlessly with it i wish the story ended there but this thing just stopped working one day it lost all of its settings and though i was able to reprogram them the learning function seems to be permanently gone i strongly recommend you avoid this product
there are a lot of remote controls on the market from the 999.95 srp philips pronto on down i did n't want anything too fancy but i do need to control several devices the seems to work adequately for my needs with my toshiba tv and mitsubishi vcr i was pleasantly surprised to have it operate at least some of my kenwood box i figure i can program the rest of the controls i need but i have n't gotten around to it yet i was astounded when the remote control failed utterly to get any response from my dvr made by philips the same company that makes the remote ! the story gets worse i 've tried to contact philips customer service both by phone and on the web so far i 've had inordinate delays mechanical voice recognition systems that go on forever been hung up on and spoke to one person who barely spoke english and seemed to have an iq of about 70. needless to say they were n't helpful i do n't expect to spend much money on any philips products in the future ! caveat emptor
quality cover protects all elements of the ipod video my problems are 1 the rubber skin is difficult to pull on and 2 the plastic front difficult to fit correctly 3 the cover for the hold button is not 'raisable ' so the cover has to be pulled back to move the hold button into and out of position 4 the cover is heavy and has to be removed to fit in the bose dock and finally 5 there 's no way to actually carry the ipod with this cover the belt clip is less than effcient for the heavier model in sum the cover is tedious to use and requires constant adjustments
sony premium grade vhs tapes used to be pretty darn days that is not the past few times that i have bought these tapes to record movies from the satellite dish there have been to many flaws with the problem has been a line through the middle of the picture like you sometimes have when you rent a movie thats about 20 years old and also there have been jumping pictures and small audio flaws as use various brands of videotape so i know that the problem lies here with the sony the record about as well as a tape you have recorded on over and over and show too much wear way too maxell tapes instead
i purchased my gigabeat in febuary 2007. the night after i got it it stopped being able to charge and it wouldnt recognize the battery for some reason but i turned the battery on and off over and over and then it started back days after i bought it all the songs magically got removed vanished i was a little nervous but put all my songs back on anyway it was alright during the month of march with no problems then a about a week ago when i finished syncing some songs to it and pulled out the usb plug all the songs vanished again i was annoyed and put them back on which took awhile then today the gigabeat stopped recognizing the battery again i frantically turned the battery on and off nothing when i plugged it into the charger it turned on but then without me doing any thing it turned off so basically it wo n't work when its not in the charger i know your thinking oh that couldnt happen to me '' but it will i garuntee that the gigabeat will dissapoint you cnet do n't know what they 're talking about do not buy it ! get the 80 gig ipod ! ! ! ! ! do not buy ! ! ! !
i was interested in the gigabeat since i did not want to have to conform to ipod the reviews were good first problem is the battery life is advertised at 12 hours try 6. i saw an article that said that 12 would be optimal conditions my battery drains in 24 hrs if not plugged in next problem one day i plugged in and started and all memory seemed to get wiped out after discussing with toshiba phone support very friendly and helpful the firmware was no longer valid sent back to toshiba and all was working less than a week later now i just started up again and now all my info is removed again this is all within a month
i was listening to these headphones for mabye 30 minutes and then the left headphone died and does n't work bad bad bad hopefully skullcandy will replace it
this is the old product meaning that there is n't a crease in the back of the protective side of the tape therefore it takes an immense amount of patience time and fortitude to get your fingenail up under the thin edge somewhere so you can peel if off oh my gawd stay away ! or make sure it is the new '' product
well my computer cabinet is 15 feet away from the monitor in the other room i got this mainly because i wanted to reduce wiring and introduce an cable to my 5.1 receiver instead of 6 audio rca cables all the way to the receiver plus wanted to be able to control individual speaker volumes on the pc couldnt do that in optical or coaxial mode no way ! ! this card can only do stereo mode with digital output so i am using those analog 5.1 outputs to the receiver atleast from the cabinet to my desk its usb so my mission is half accomplished but hey wait one more shocking thing i noticed is that the volume control is in no way which means that as you turn the volume each speaker is unevenly ! ! ! takes place subtle so you dont notice it much but if youre into very listening you will certainly pull your hair over this overall an ok card if you like decent looks if you want something cheaper go for an audigy se instead it does exactly the same thing at half the cost
check it so i got my new headphones i had been waiting 2 weeks free shipping deal for and when i opened the box i was like sweet these look pretty tight then i went to put them on ya know test them out and the darned things would't fit over my big dome i went to adjust them and i was like they ca n't be adjusted ! i went to lift them up and oh snap them things snapped ! ! i got mad and threw them against the wall packaged them up and sent them back i still havent received my
too tight for my head not that big sound average for a 30 dollar headphone a lot smaller and less comfortable then the predecessor hinge broke after 3 months of use dont bother
i bought 2 being stupid and thinking they would surely fit my 7 '' coby dvd players they did not when i went to return them they said that in addition to paying the return shipping i had to pay a 15 restocking fee '' ! so 25 to return 2 items totalling 33 ! also the return policy is very tricky and akin to those we hope you get so frustrated you never fill it out '' rebate cards as to the product i ordered 2 of the same thing and 1 is differnent than the other ! they are shoddy and have a lot of different places where the craftmanship seems poor overall below average product from a company with horrible if you 're going to roll the dice on the low price good luck
this case is too large for general carrying of a dvd player there were too many velcro straps included without instructions or ideas on how to use them pictures were on the package however i could n't figure most of them out
i have n't enjoyed the boom box because the antenna could n't find a signal after moving it to every possible south facing setting to send to the boom box i used this xm receiver in one of my trucks and it worked fine not the case with the indoor
i 've had mine since nov 2006. at first i it ! it charged fast was just the right size was easy to use i have to say that the software kind of sucked but it was n't that bad just do n't expect any marathon sessions of loading music on after i 'd load about albums it 'd crash and i 'd have to restart the software but i only load things once a week if that so i 'm not to concerned now though my player no longer charges unless i hold it in the usb port if i let go of it it disconnects from the computer at first i thought it was my port but 4 ports later it 's the player i think it 's been dropped maybe twice in the past 5 months so i 'm not sure if that was it or some other wierd flaw the case lets dust in so now my display is very hard to read if you 'll be using it outdoors a lot forget reading the display at all sunlight makes anything displayed virtually unreadable all in all i thought i 'd get longer thatn 5 months out of it before something major went wrong with it sony 's tech support was mostly useless they asked if i 'd tried a different usb cord with it to make sure it was n't the cord um my player plugs directly in and this was after i 'd told them the make and model they 'll replace it with a refurb model for 30 but that also means i have to go for god knows how long without any tunes at work or in the gym i have a work around to make it charge right now so pretty much i 'm going to use it until it drops then get an ipod or maybe a sandisk
i was initially impressed with small cool design and digital display of the sony until i received mine unlike every other usb hard drive with the sony drive you ca n't simply drag and drop your existing and wma music files to it you must first load the sony software and then it goes through and converts all of you music files to sony proprietary format now every time you want to add more music you need to download it then convert it the software is not user friendly and converting file formats is simply a waste of time i guess the sony music people got their hands a hold of this and wanted add protection for themselves and avoid losing licensing fees very annoying ! !
the software is freezing the computer i tested it in my desktop and my laptop and you ca n't transfer the files using the windows explorer you have to use the sony 's software
you have to use their lousy sonicstage software to transfer songs to it that is just stupid well not just stupid arrogant also i was attracted to this thing becasue of it 's size battery life which is exaggerated by at least 50 radio tuner and most of all its support of aac encoded files apple 's products have no radio tuners and if you 've chosen aac as your audio codec you have n't been able to get a flash based player which will both play the radio and play your aac files kudos to sony for allowing it to play aac audio files it 's about time someone besides apple implemented this mpeg standardized codec in their '' players but why force poorly written software sonicstage down our throats why force any software down our throats with almost all flash based players you can just drag and drop your music files via your operating system you just connect it as an external hard drive and drag and drop then also you can use them from windows macs linux whatever and why are they still pushing atrac codecs it 's a waste of their time and money and the world does not need sony trying to push its own proprietary codecs it 's by no means superior to the standardized mpeg aac codec or microsoft 's proprietary although basically free wma codecs dear sony your codec is not significant it is not a player in the audio codec world and the world is better off without you trying to push it on us the same can be said about your other proprietary variations on standardized technologies betamax and memory sticks you just make the world more complicated in the end you lose and your market share goes to zero although i did think minidiscs were a good idea it 's a good piece of hardware but in order to use it you have to jump through sony 's hoops just say no
unfortunately my creative zen did not worked with my system i even bought a new pc to see if the creative would work at all but it did n't happened ! please do n't bother to buy this product buy a sansa it much simpler and easy to use ! i end up returning the product back to amazon because it was obviously very defective ! ! ! i hope my review was helpful to you
this product replaces a 5 gig creative micro which had a hard drive and broke at 1 year after a minor drop the zen v is easier to download the 2 gig space allows me to hold up to 5 audiobooks and some music the battery is lasting about 10 hours sound quality is better than the micro i appreciate former comments about the unit will not lose its place if the unit is shut down while playing rather than hitting the button which will start at the beginning of the book or song i had a few encounters with the unit freezing up i can control the frequency of freezes by allowing the unit to think '' after i touched a button or control it 's a little slow to respond to the commands if i 'm pressing a button more than once or hitting the back button command to get into the system controls i wait until the unit gets to the window that i want before telling the unit what to do no freezing
i bought this from antonline this product does not fit all explorists as their advertisement says it is not even close to fitting the explorist xl i returned it in perfect shape i spent nearly 30.00 with shipping both ways and antonline refunded to me 2.43 the extra shipping was their fault and the restocking fees are ridiculous ! i advise you to not throw your money at this poisonous enterprise
this is kinda cheap the case has very little padding it 's too large for the explorist gps batteries fall out of the interior pouch at times not belt clip there are much better products available at this price
i had a pioneer burner that i used for about 7 years prior to buying this piece of junk the pioneer unit worked fine until it finally gave out the sony deck was initially ok once i worked my way through an extremely confusing operator 's manual i succeeded in making several needle drop '' cd 's from older lp sources however after about 90 days everything went wrong i could still make whole cd 's and finalize easily but 4 out of every 5 cd 's i made skip when played back in any other player be that the car my computer or at the office in short all the time and money spent have been for naught i wo n't buy any sony components again
the favorable reviews written elsewhere in here must be plants by sony operatives because my experience sadly replicates to the letter those described in the negative reviews the machine plays cds fine but its recording process is fraught with problems the directions are not only inscrutable from my conversations with sony tech support you have to go online to find the telephone number it 's not included in any of the materials and that tells you something right there i have learned that the directions are incomplete but even with the tips provided by the tech support people the machine hardly works at all a typical problem after about an hour 's worth of recording it often but not always gives you an error message that the medium you are using is somehow inadequate it tells you this even when the medium is a brand new sony disc recommended by sony with which the machine has had no problem until that moment this is fatal to the whole recording process and one hour has gone down the drain this happens repeatedly but not consistently another recurring problem if you manage to make it through the recording process without any error messages the last step finalization '' is also a hit or miss proposition sometimes it works sometimes it does n't use of this device is an extremely frustrating and time wasting proposition purchase of this product is pure foolishness folks this is just a total lemon about as crappy as that mustang i once had but that 's another story you have been warned
i have been a loyal sony product user for over 30 years however their compact disc recorder is the most confusing piece of equipment to operate that i have ever seen it reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone 's tastes for instance why does it need a remote how many people will be cutting cds from their easy chairs i have a call in to two friends who i hope can rescue me from my dilemma
i just bought my unit on ebay it was a refurbished model directly from sony my main only purpose in buying the unit is to transcribe several hundred cassettes onto cds after realizing i did n't have the right blanks i went out and got what should be the right blanks memorex digital audio the unit should accept any commeercial sold blank as long as it is in the right format that got me to where i could see that the disks were being read and appeared to be recording with some problems i was able to finalize '' a disk however it does n't play in either the a or b drive nor on my regular cd player i read where one guy said you have to use sony blanks i 'm going to try that as a last effort if that does n't work i 'm probably gon na return it and just leave my cassettes alone soundwise they are fine it 's a matter of storage and space i tried to record an lp and that did n't even appear that it was recording by way of the sound bars i 'm gon na keep trying for now but this unit has gotten an awful lot of bad press i have a sony dual cassette player that works fine but this item may not fall into that category so to sum up so far i ca n't record and lp to cd i have n't been able to transfer cassette to cd that finalizes and plays and i have n't been able to record a cd to cd that sounds like three strikes and you 're out to me any cds i burn will be done on my computer that 's much faster than what this unit could do and the reproduction quality has been excellent since writing my review i followed the advice of a reviewer to use only sony blanks they must be the digital audio type or they wo n't work i was able to successfully record a cassette to cd and it sounded great i hope my problems with the unit are behind me now and i am encouraged to make further copies
the plastic is really thick and hard to get an ipod mini in and out of if you move your ipod between docking stations and speakers this is too cumbersome to deal with
i have to say that i am extremely disappointed in this product after just a few months with normal usage i noticed small tears beginning to form around the screws attaching the band to the plastic holder also two of the velcro patches used to secure the armband have peeled away rendering my arm band useless this product is not very durable and for 25 to 30 dollars is expensive to have to replace every 8 months or so i do not recommend this product to anyone
ran fine for just over a year pointedly this took it just beyond the warranty period then the converter in the ac power cord failed mearly bursting into flames unfortunately the failure mode also took out the modem itself so instead of a 15 power cord i got to replace the whole modem i bought a different brand this time with a warranty ominously however both modems were made in china
it worked fine first month then it get slower and slower sometimes i could only get 20 turn it off and back on again performance get much better for couple hours and then it slow down again faulty product ! downloading from the same website my sister got i got max 200 after turn off and back on disapointed ! ! !
good price for portable hard drive you do n't have to use this as a sync it can be for storage do n't know what other reviewers were smoking loved it as a backup and pc toolkit i put all software i need to fix others machines and for business software and 40 gig itunes backup seriously used it times and now it is dead light goes on but must have been a bad hard drive to begin with started rma process and am waiting on replacement wd have had some serious reliability issues for years so it did not surprise me nice package if it still worked hoping my one will be a good one also i suggest using this for on the road backups not as your main backup as it may not be reliable enough for that purpose
i purchased this item thinking that i could manipulate files and make room on my laptop hard drive by transferring them to the portable but this product will not accomplish that it allows you to share the same files between two computers but will not allow you to view the files move them or have files stored on the portable without having them on your there was no indication of this synchronization '' process on the package or inserts i needed to search the wd website to learn what this item is intended for the website emphatically tells you to not use this to your files i have not doubt that you use it to synchronize files it will work well
basically the comes with very few instructions and you have to go on the internet to find any manuals and so on even with the online help it is very confusing and i have not been able to get it to work at all the instructions you do get assume that you have used other midi devices in the past and so that just getting a hint written in computer jargon is enough
this was one of the biggest mistakes i 've made concerning the installation of my plasma tv on the wall i only intended to use two of the three shelves and then i only had a dvd player and a hd satellite receiver the shelves were more than adaquate to hold what i wanted to put on them but the channel in the back was useless for my two items i used a hdmi cable for one component and a composite video 5 wires for the dvd player the power cords for each would n't fit into the channel and the pin was n't able to be placed at the top i wasted the money i spent on it and finally just screwed two of the shelf supports that came with it to studs in the wall and purchased wiremold surface mounted plastic raceways to cover the wires i 'm happy with my solution and it looks good if the channer were large enough then this system would be good the channel is only big enough for a power cord and speaker wires and nothing else a big disappointment of course once you get it mounted you ca n't return it because it 's used so you 're stuck good luc
purchased this for use during travel but screen is not viewable outdoors and barely viewable indoors reception is poor unless outfitted with the xium antenna the only positives include rugged handsome case and jacks for external devices including external antenna this would have been a much better product if they had included a cowling for the screen not sure how it can be packaged and advertised for use outdoors when it performs so shabbily under those circumstances
i bought this product from amazon i have tried it all over the place and the device simply does not work do not be impressed by its looks a worthless buy pass on this one
i bought this dvd wishing to improve the picture quality of my old dvd collection i did n't notice anything when compare to my old 33 dvd i do n't understand any review made on this item the image is not even close to hd so why is this dvd called upconverter hd the upconvertion might be because it has a hdmi output but nothing else the images displayed are comparable to any other dvd player i 'm going to keep it anyway because it is very flat and it fits my cabinet but if you are looking to upconvert your old dvd collection to hd forget it the only way to watch hd is with the blueray dvd or the hd dvd in other hand i believe that if you have a hdtv they come with internal upconverters that wo n't let you notice any difference when comparing this product to any other dvd keep your money for ! speakers !
i bought these to replace a pair of sony fontopias i had i loved the sonys but was trying to save some money and most of the reviews seemed favorable while they are ok earphones i was dissapointed with the sound range and quality they really dont block out much ambient noise and the fit is not very comfortable for 20.00 they work but i wouldnt order them again
the time starts ticking when the item is purchased not when it ships ! the gps that i bought will not ship for another couple of months and i agreed to purchase it a month ago so with the one year manufacturer 's warranty or whatever and the three months or more one is actually being delivered less than expected
i bought this and within ten minutes it failed i was completely dissappointed with this purchase i loved the concept but the product is cheap and will not hold up to normal use lesson learned
just the first time i used it the signal was little bit noisy even with the adjustemnts but then i pluged it out for the nigth next morning i pluged in again and it symply never worked again
i was looking for an inexpensive way to store homemade cd 's so i chose this item i would estimate that at least 40 of the cases arrived damaged or broken and they are so cheaply constructed that on the ones that were n't broken the plastic tabs break on the first or second use spend a little more and get something of higher quality
what can you say about cd cases these would be adequate they had n't arrived damaged whoever does the packing for amazon should learn that a single sheet of brown paper will not prevent shipping damage a little bubble wrap may be more expensive but it would have prevented my returning this order for a refund
if apple makes everthing works as it advertized then it 's worth it
a horid thing thats incompatable with anything unless you know how to change its subnet which is impossable
i bought this to upgrade my wireless connection to my xbox 360. the wireless connectivity was passable not great but what ultimately made me return this was after multiple tests i determined that the router had cut my connection speed to a third of its original speed i tried to linksys tech support to no avail
i have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with 3 of these at the office each one is plagued with the activity lights flashing constantly when there are no other wireless devices in range flashed to the latest firmware i tried multiple locations even going as far to bring one home and see what happened i live the middle of no where so i am sure there are not any wireless devices around also the fact that neither or would keep a constant connect sitting the laptop 1 foot from the router and the speed would fall back to lower connect speeds constantly after trying multiple wireless lan cards and multiple laptops i can honestly say this ap is a piece of garbage and i would not recommend it at all
zero stars is more like it no matter what i did in the way of configuration it would not work i have wasted nearly a week of my time trying to get this piece of junk to hold a configuration to no avail finally my frustration with it grew so intense that i took it to my garage and fixed '' it with a mallet i can assure you it will not be giving anyone else problems avoid at all costs
i contacted linksys to determine the best product to purchase to improve signal coverage in home network first tried extender and should have listened to others who rated it poorly on amazon it was worthless then purchased the at linksys advice i set up fine but could not get access to the internet once i connected to the wap support basically just said it wo n't work with the router this company is the worst i would not purchase linksys in the future
if you use either the or satellite modems and do n't have a telephone do not buy tivo ! despite what their website advertises tivo series 2 dvrs can not get programming updates over satellite internet tivo blames hughesnet and tivo customer support is so bad i would put it in the same category with calling is a waste of your time they do not care tivo would n't offer me a refund after advanced technical support promised to extend my warranty until their engineering dept could provided an upcoming patch when the patch failed to fix anything they told me to change my internet provider like i could if i wanted to or that i was simply out of luck they offered to cancel my tivo service but no refund amazing ineptitude when dvrs work they are really cool but buyer beware there must be better dvrs out there i sure hope so
this dvr works but when it is recording forget about changing channels it is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks broadband feature is nice but usb does n't come cheap its like
i paid 250 for a voice recorder and could n't find the cd when i replaced my laptop you 'd think sony would offer a download or replacement through but no you have to buy the software all over again the 250 recorder is now useless because of their proprietary format but i 'll be darned if they are getting another penny of my money and they should n't get a penny of yours
pros cheap cons unit grounding in high end system with amps you will likely get alternator whine plate dont attach firmly in place makes pressing buttons move the whole plate the cd brings the motorized plate down but dont allways eject the cd are very small and hard to press especially the track foward and back buttons are hard to press is horrible allthough rms is not listed it sounded horrible worse than my old deck panasonic 1303 rated at yes this is a very cheap unit and cheaply priced what i looked at was the retail price listed for this unit at 299 amazon claims with a savings of over 155 honestly it was a waste of time is way overrated they are selling at 74 cause its barely worth that first installing it in an exsisting system that was flawlessly working i started to get a very bad alternator whine from the engine i rechecked everything redoing all the grounds with no effect took to a professional shop where they told me it was the deck causing the problem they told me the deck could be defective but very likely any replacement would do the same since boss sells low quality problems not only that i noticed many other problems with the deck for one the cd eject button would bring the panel down but not eject the cd about 80 of the time i noticed playing cds that the unit would totaly mess up playing fast at times loud chirps and squeaks cds i had and used before in other decks and players track foward and back buttons are very small and hard to press often moving the poorly fastended plate the remote design was the same way very hard to press buttons overall i have to say this decks sound quality was less than my panasonic deck i upgraded because i wanted the extra and the input for my ipod i am returning this and getting an alpine deck i wouldnt waste your time with deck if you have any need for a good quality deck and dont plan to upgrade anything more than factory speakers in your car
com'on folks let 's be real here the coby headphones may have decent sound for a pair of cheap headphones but com'on they 're only 5 or less i 've tried them on a computer monitior at work and they sound decent the bass is average at best if these have a driver then i 'd hate to hear what a smaller one in a coby set would sound like i 've also tried them on my 5.1 amplified pc and they distort way too easily the bass distorts at almost the slightest bit of bass and i concur with those who say that it 's a roll of the dice to get a good working pair as the in my set is a bit weak i mean let 's face it these are some pretty cheap headphones if you want a cheap but great sounding pair of headphones you better look to a set in the range take for instance the koss 1 titaniums for 18 here on amazon they 're sold for upwards of 45 at retailers like radio shack and from all the glowing reviews they 're a hellava set of headphones i gave this set only because they 're decent for a cheap pair but for audiophiles stear clear
do not buy this one i bought this because i had to compensate for a few dollars to be eligible for free shipping this product did not work at all i threw away the headphones as i could n't get it replaced
yes it 's cheap that does n't mean it 's worth buying i ordered two of these one seems to work fine the other only had one working earpiece i had to send it back for a replacement pain in the but and i have to hope the replacement does n't fail too dave says be forewarned
nice little it only worked for 2 days when it lost half of the screen contacted company j r and they said it was within 30 day warranty so i sent it not received new replacement that they and see
the picture is really nice but playback time did not last long first time charge lasted less than 1 hour and playback time indicated low battery before the end of a movie less than hours long still need to recharge and try again and see if playback lasts longer this time around really like the slim design and really good picture quality but not happy with battery life
i bought this player for viewing movies while camping fortunately we usually sleep in our suv so we have access to a dc power outlet this player does come with a cord that plugs into a cigarette lighter outlet otherwise it would be totally useless because the fully charged battery only lasts about 45 minutes the picture is ok but colors are not at all bright or vibrant the sound is barely loud enough even when you 're sitting two feet from the unit i 've only watched two movies on it so far and it froze up once requiring a restart from the beggining of the movie but it does have a scene skip that allowed us to get back to where we left off pretty quickly if it keeps working i 'd say it was worth the 50 i paid for it at cvs
when i first got the portable dvd player i charged the battery and when i inserted a dvd and after a few minutes it would freeze and skip certain parts of the movie i tried to restart it and tried other dvds and it kept saying wrong disc '' so anyone who is looking to get this portable dvd player i advice you not to becuase it will cause a lot of problems and its just going to be a waste of money
i bought this unit to use in beverly hills the house has a direct line of sight from mt wilson where the over the air transmitters are located i used it inside the house it could barely get a signal it was so bad i removed it then i decided to take it to my house in the san fernando valley again line of sight from the transmitters i took it up to my floor media room with the antenna inside the house on the wall facing the transmitters again it barely gets a signal i would get better reception with rabbit ears or a wire strung on the wall do not buy this it is a total waste of money
this has been a bit disappointing in regard to the signal quality i get for my home theater pc i got nearly the same signal strength from the free antenna that came with my tuner card
spent more time moving it to different locations than watching its a joke
i could not get this unit to work wirelessly with the sony locationfree and an apple airport extreme router i was able to use the buffalo technology airstation turbo g high power wireless ethernet to stream tv to psp wirelessly and across the internet tech support was fine the device was just incompatible with my apple router
this thing gets very hot and requires reboots quite often jsut like others have said no firmware updates for it either get it together
product is was used as a wireless bridge to allow a pc eventually several pcs and a printer using a hub or router to connect to my linksys a great unit and through the linksys to my firewall router and then my dsl modem the wireless gaming adapter firmware ver 1.0 is the latest as of this writing was very painful to configure and would lose settings during its reboot after finally getting the configurations to it connected to the network but very slow cycling power fixed whatever problem it had the was in the same room as my for testing and i was able to achieve full internet surfing download speed which for me is 1.1 using online broadband testing i did not test overall speed btw the instructions are totally not adequate for even a simple secured network and if you set the unit to a dynamic ip address you need to know how to figure out its ip address on your network before you can into the unit i had to reset the unit to a static ip that is compatible in my network instructions seem to be written assuming wireless access point set to its defaults more or less the feedback as to network connection was very it was not clear from the unit when it was the or the quality of the link after taking 3 hours to get working it failed the next day like others reported the unit runs very hot generally i dig into hardware problems and call support and fight the good fight so your mileage may if you call however this product seems so poor just tossing this thing in the trash use this product at your own risk and recommend you have a good handle on wireless networking to attempt using this unit
this game adapter does not work with the but works perfectly with a router how strange is that
do not buy this for your xbox it sucks the unit was functional well not defective and by 'dialing in ' to the unit it was able to communicate with and wires with my computer the first red flag was when the xbox did not recognize the as a wireless adapter this is normal it has to be configured with an ip address which is ridiculous because the wired router connection is normally plug and play however no amount of configuration in the xbox dashboard would allow the xbox to connect wirelessly this was even with the assistance of tech support which is spotty at best the folks are nice enough but getting through can take a very long time i 'm okay with networks all of my other stuff works great but definitely not an expert and i could go on and on about the changes i made i wo n't though if you prefer painless it 's probably best to match brands when designing a wireless network i 'll give the benefit of the doubt and admit i was using a router of a different brand but with all of the configuration options on both ends this should not matter oh and i read some of the earlier reviews and i agree that this thing runs real hot who knows what that 'll do for the product 's longevity because i do n't plan to keep it if i ever got it to function properly and i had small children then i 'd probably mount it out of their reach
being a huge fan of xm i was excited when i saw this product sure it looked bulky but i was n't going to be moving around much while i used it and i was going to use it only outside the first unit i received worked fine but the frequency selector toggle '' snapped off within the first few hours leaving me unable to adjust either this appeared to be a design flaw and as such i promptly returned it without incident i did get a second one and am mindful of this toggle switch i do note that even with careful use the headphones age very quickly and i do not think they will last too long the bottom line is that the product works as advertised but does so at great expense bulk and does not appear to be durable if you can get a much lower price go for it !
loud hiss all the time the sound comes and goes all the time works 10 mins then stops have to turn volume up loud to get it back when working sounds but will not continue working i have a pretty new sony tv and am only 12 feet away but the unit just does not work shame i liked it when it worked
do n't be confuse by amazon 's slick pictures the transmitter for the sony wireless speaker is not included misleading advertising could n't tell you if the speakers any good
horrible is the only word i can think of to describe this product i 'll preface my comments by saying that i do not consider myself to be an audiophile i am an average guy who wanted to be able to listen to my sirius sat radio or ipod throughout my house and in my backyard while relaxing or entertaining here was my experience with these speakers i received them on friday they were very easy to setup and connected easily to my sirius receiver in my office the first thing i did n't like about the speakers was that even when connected to the power supply they were not very loud at max volume in a quiet office they were at a decent volume but not what i consider to be loud more of a background ambience level not a pure listening volume i then took the speakers into my backyard i set them on my patio roughly 20 feet from the transmitter but outside of my brick house the sound quality was horrible lots of popping hissing and drop outs while only 15 feet from the transmitter i opened my windows in my office tried all 3 of the avaialble channels nothing improved the reception when i could hear these speakers at full volume they were barely loud enough to hear about 10 feet away from the speakers it was impossible to hear them at all in the furthest corner of my yard i tried moving the speakers to that corner of the yard and completely lost the signal from the transmitter about 50 feet from my house nothing but static at that point this morning i took the speakers into my kitchen roughly 40 feet from the transmitter with 2 walls between the only place i could get a signal on the speakers was sitting them on top of my fridge while there was no popping while in the kitchen the hissing was considerably more pronounced in the house the volume was good while in the kitchen and could be heard anywhere within that area but that also includes hearing the hissing throughout the entire space this morning i contacted amazon to return these speakers since they did not meet my expectations to add insult to injury amazon will be charging me to return the speakers as well as the shipping to send them to me since they were over 25 i got the free '' super saver shipping i guess it 's only free '' if you keep the item if you return it amazon will charge you therefore it 's going to cost me about 20 to find out these speakers are horrible ! as a solution for all of you who are looking for the ability to hear your music in every room of your house do an amazon search for whole house fm transmitter gold '' for less than these speakers you can buy a whole house fm transmitter and pick up your sat radio ipod tv etc off of a crystal clear fm signal i received one of these units yesterday as well and i am keeping this it produced a signal i could pick up on every radio inside and outside of my house including my basement i will replace these sony wireless speakers with an under cabinet radio for my kitchen and a boombox for my backyard my recommendation is to avoid these horrible speakers
received garmin navigator package card product without card in clear blister package package opened and data card removed amazon immediately issued credit to account when empty package was returned and issued a coupon for my inconvenience
i had this phone for 3 days before sending it back it added some very slight static to the calls to make sure it was not my line causing it i plugged it directly into the wall at various points around the house and i could hear the static even when it was not plugged into the phone jack i think some people may not hear this or be this picky but it was not that good for outgoing quality either people on the other end told me i sounded a bit metallic when i switched between old and new phone and let them do an comparison
i bought this phone since because if the available features and the looks big mistake the sound quality on this phone is horrible also people have complained about not being able to hear my voice clearly i packed up the phone the next day and returned it trust me when i say this do not buy this phone '' if you do you 'll just be wasting time taking it back to the store
i brought this peice two months ago it never worked this is a peice of junk to through in garbage if you want to through your money like that just donate your money to somebody may be 1 in 10000 will work better products than this you can buy
this is a very cheap player i bought one for my wife and 1 for myself the faceplates of both broke within a few weeks in both cases my wife and i just had them in our pockets and our keys i guess broke the faceplates also if you listen to longer podcasts or ebooks and turn the player off it does not start where you stopped it at the navigation is difficult another problem is that the microphone button is in a bad location and i constantly hit it and it is difficult to get it to stop and change back to the player overall avoid this playe
as others have written in their reviews the radio reception on this is simply horrible the manual and their website suggest extending the power cord to improve reception however nothing we did made it tolerable to listen any station on the dial the static and noise were simply not acceptable we have three or four other radios in the house that all pull in the stations just fine so it must be this unit we picked it up for 50 at target and even at that price it 's not worth it we 're returning the item
quickly fm reception stinks as others have noted it is truly horrible if you live near an fm transmitter as i do the 6 or so stations broadcasting from that tower come in all across the dial totally washing out all weaker ones and all of the weatherband channels as well i 've since learned that the fix for this is an intermodulation filter '' clearly this sony unit does not have one even my 15 manual dial fm radio does a far superior job how stupid of sony to not get this right ! cd sound quality is ok no mechanical probs so far 2 years old tv and am bands are timer is countdown only no alarm daylight savings button to quickly adjust clock twice a year is convenient clock is accurate looks good
i ordered double density diskettes which you initially acknowledged you shipped high density diskettes i have no use for the 100 high desnity diskettes and would appreciate your correcting your error robert seabright 2950 kane rd leland ill 60531 if you will send my correct order i will return the incorrect item by return mail
i bought this tv to pick up armed forces network signals at my base in iraq transmitted from on the base btw and all i get is a very poor picture and sound i can barely hear the reception is worthless in my opinion so i packaged it up and sent it to my son back home thanks axion i had to go out and buy a regular tv for 99 which works perfectly with the enclosed rabbit ears
it the creative zen player is plugged with the charger and play at the same time in the car it gives out squeaky sound
this is an okay product however the cds have a tendency to fall out of the case every time you open them would not purchase again it 's too bad i like the colors just not the quality
i bought this for my wife for christmas it has a nice look and matched our kitchen installed it and it failed right away it took several times just to play a cd then the cd draw got stuck then the right speaker failed i returned and bought a better one
first to start off i would give it a -5 if i could ! 1 star was the only lowest i can select ! i would never recommend this brand to anyone ! you get what you pay for and that 's understandable after i bought a nature sound alarm clock and the tuning nobs broke after 1 week after another week the nature sound of the night crickets froze and you hear high pitch noises and the battery started leaking very dangerous i was using duracell ! i thought buying this will help me relax and go to sleep with the sweet sound of nature ! no ! i got woken up from the annoying pitch noises as if the crickets are crying ! i wasted 10 also i asked for a shower clock cd and radio with mirror for christmas and i received a jwin brand i guess my last experience with the barnd would change nope radio went dead after 2 weeks and the cd player stoped playing after 2 more week it never touch water and it says showerproof i left it out the shower hanging instead this unit took 6 c batteries ! waste of my time money and frustration remember jwin never wins dont blow your money and take the risk it through you see many people reported problems with this item it seems like jwin do n't know how to make a cd player work you get what you pay for and read the review people may have it working for a longer time ! dont drill holes in your cabinet for nothing ! just sharing my
after a couple of months the cd player does not work any more the radio still works but i am very disappointed with my purchase not to mention the holes i had to drill in the bottom of my cabinet for nothing
the day i got it i was so excited to mount this and start using it attaching the item was very easy to do if you can read which i was in luck there so i got that done as soon as i used it it was n't working correctly to start with i opened the slot to put the cd into it and the cd tray would n't close i had to turn the power off and then back on to get the tray to go back into the unit by this time it was easier to just do that then to remove the unit and send it back so to this day i have it in the kitchen but between the cd tray and the poor sound quality i dont use it as much as i thought i would
just a warning after 1 week of very light use the cd player is unable to play any cds the radio still works but the cd player is not working not impressed with the quality
i bought one of these at christmas for my wife it died silently in 3 months now it displays the time but no backlight it will not play the ipod nor will it charge it you know i 've had clock radios that lasted 10 years and more and the cost far less than this worthless piece of junk i 'm sure they do n't all fail this rapidly but given that some do i would stay far away from this product
i bought the white ihome from apple along with a nano the directions say you must use the proper insert for your ipod and it includes 5 inserts none of the inserts support the current nano nor the mini apples best selling model the directions helpfully suggest that you may inserts for your ipod what a crock ! i plan to confront ihome and apple if they do not give me the inserts for my ipods i will return the and move on why is buying consumer goods always such a pain
i always read costomer reviews before buying anything i did just that with the pixma and was confident in my purchase 14 months after purchase the thing cant print black now when revisiting the reviews there seems to be a comon complaint canon pixma wont print black keep in mind when buying an all in one printer that without black printing what good will it do wish i would have seen this complaint before maybe i did and thought it wont happen to me '' seems like its happening to over 30 of these currently reviews
i bought my pixma 780 in july within 1 yr the print head failed black would n't print but it was under warranty and they replaced it 9 months later the same problem ! now it 's not under warranty and the replacement is 50 ! it was good while it worked but 2 failures of the print head in less than 2 years and i am using canon cartridges too ! never again hp or epson from here on out now it serves as a glorified scanner and fax machine '' that ca n't receive because it wo n't print
i purchased this mp 780 printer in may 2006 6 months later the problem began the only color that the printer was able to print was basically black all the other colors were barely visible i contacted canon and they sent me a replacement print head i had to wait 3 weeks to receive it instead of the promised days because it was on back order anyway it worked fine after that now 2 months later after replacing the print head the same problem has returned i bought this printer because it got such good ratings i will not be buying another canon printer again i have an old hp inkjet printer that i bought in 2000 and have never had a problem with it
i have had nothing but problems out of mine first off the screen went out due to a factory defect only 3 months after buying got it fixed and went out agian i just took the piece of junk nad threw it away i wouldnt waist my time with it
i received this player as a gift and although i tried to not be too judgmental the first view of the player was nothing other than repulsive the minute you see the player the first thing that draws your attention is not in fact the screen but rather the large thick black bar that houses the speakers directly under the screen these speakers are so awkwardly placed they make the average screen size seem even smaller than it would if the speakers were placed somewhere more aesthetically pleasing after turning it on for a test another thing that bothered me was the extremely obnoxiously whirring the player makes whenever it plays anything it overpowers and distracts from the volume of movies or music and makes it hard to concentrate much like the white noise you hear when wearing headphones on an airplane the player although covered in a sleek metal is actually quite flimsy and my personal screen was quite loose overall i would absolutely not recommend this piece of garbage for anyone save your money for something that 's worth it
i love the way this product looked it was slim and sexy the reality was that it was a battery hog the media pad was basically useless there were frequent bluetooth disconnections and i actually had to return it once because the keys stopped working i am not a gorilla typist i eventually gave up on it i give it 2 stars it was a nice design but it just did n't deliver
it looks great but the media pad makes it too wide the battery on the media pad does n't last very long so i ended up not wanting to replace the batteries again just not using it i usually use the number pad so this was a real inconvenience the mouse is also too heavy for my liking i 'm buying something else !
the included receiver has very limited range if you already have another receiver i did you might be able to live with this set there is no back lighting on the keys or mediapad lcd the media pad is somewhat useful to use as remote control for itunes and windows media player however the useless lcd ca n't navigate song titles it simply displays the currently playing title would be great if you could scroll down a list of and tag for play
with the dinovo cordless media bluetooth desktop logitech has produced a product with a sleek appearance the product looks sharp and the mouse has a nice the mouse has a rechargeable battery and comes with a recharging cradle so the disappointment of finding a dead battery in your cordless mouse has been relegated to the old days '' when the product works there is a noticeable lag between keyboard entry or mouse movement and a response on the screen surprisingly the lag time seems to be greater for this bluetooth device than my older cordless desktop but it is not so long as to make the product unusable however this product has two fatal flaws first as other reviewers have found my experience with the dinovo is that it crashes constantly secondly logitech is no help whatsoever with this product a keyboard and mouse that work less than 50 of the time is simply not acceptable for my needs bottom line is this product did n't even help my clutter problem on my desk because my corded keyboard and corded mouse have to sit right next to the computer for rapid access whenever this product decides to stop working this product is troublesome unreliable and decidedly not recommended
this light is very weak for a led light consider the coast digitac ii if you are looking for a high quality flashlight that uses a single aa battery if you do n't mind using 3 aaa 's the coast tactical power chip 7736 is the best there is for a small flashlight if you want rechargable get the coast digi tac focus rechargeable
i guess i 'm one of the few people who did n't already know this but if you use wireless internet and other wireless connections wireless keyboard wireless mouse wireless printer etc you can not use 5.8 ghz phones without having horrible interference on the phone in fact even 2.4 ghz phones get some '' loss around wireless internet connections apparently after calling uniden customer support i found out that if you want to use a wireless phone around a wireless internet connection you must use a less advanced '' 900 mhz phone i returned this phone and bought a 900 mhz phone that works perfect sad that a more advanced more expensive phone is worse than a cheaper less advanced cordless phone if you do n't have wireless internet and none of your neighbors have wireless internet then i 'm sure this phone is fine
at first glance the comprehensive feature set for these phone is impressive including such perks as wall mountable room monitor mode if you have more than one handset different ringtones and 2.4 and 5.8 ghz these same features turn out to be inaccessable or compromised to the point of uselessness only the main unit is wall mountable the satellites are not if your phone jack is not near the wall you want to mount on you have no options this is important if you use voip do n't expect to mount the kitchen handset on the wall room monitor or baby monitor is frankly idiotic it 's suggested to monitor a sleeping baby the batteries grant perhaps half an hour of eavesdropping if you 're lucky enough to activate that mode in the first place you need to negotiate menu after menu and dig it up after which one phone emits a very loud tone the second phone then rings loudly as well and when you confirm it you have them beep at the same time believe me baby is not sleeping any more there are many ringtones packaged with the phone and are all uniformly and universally irritating the best sounds tinny and cheap the worst makes you scramble for the phone just to end its metallic shriek 2.4 ghz grants very little range i 've lost contact with a thin intervening wall and twenty feet of space my old and cheaper panasonic allowed me to stroll to the mailbox without static on the call you can not dial your voicemail in speakerphone mode the phonebook and speaker buttons are tiny and the talk button which also hangs up the call is huge and placed dead center on the phone cough and you 've hung up callers need identify themselves now as you can be confident you will no longer recognize their voices i have already mistaken a friend 's voice for his sister 's and embarassed them both for that mistake and embarassed myself that i normally a careful shopper purchased such a techno dud i was warned against uniden products and should have heeded those warnings when these phones expire i go back to panasonic unfortunately i must grant these phones an extra star because they do seem to be built well although not very rugged heavy and uncomfortable to hold they will probably withstand impact well enough that i will not be able to justify purchasing new phones anytime soon update spoke too soon first one broke this morning from a fall on to a wood floor and the other one managed to drop a call five feet from the base two cans and a string would be better i suspect that the rave reviews this phone received are because other reviewers have n't tried better phones this phone ultimately suffers from lack of uncomfortable unintelligible and inaccessible skip it for something else
much like the previous reviewer i urge you not to spend lots of money on hdmi cables hdmi specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost therefore there is no reason no matter what the cable is made of to spend money on hdmi cables search the internet you can find plenty of good hdmi cables for 10 or less digital is zeroes and ones in hdmi 's case either the cable is connected or it isn't
these do work great for organizing cds and dvds and i do still use them but i found that the two inside can become scratched by a small plastic ridge that runs down the middle of the page i kept my tv dvds in these pages for awhile and discovered that all the discs on the inside of the pages had been scratched along this ridge a few of my simpsons discs still wo n't play certain episodes so i keep all the discs on the outside slots only and i 've never had another problem with them i use the inside slots for liner lists though i usually have to trim them to make them fit right
if i had three arms maybe four this would have been easy to put up as i have only two it was a nightmare each section warps as the screws are tightened so getting each subsequent section level and nested neatly inside the previously mounted section is very difficult on second thought even if i had more arms than a hindu deity i would still dislike this product the inside of the channel has ledges in it to hold the screws in place these ledges catch on cables which the user adds or removes after the unit is mounted i gave up on trying to remove an rca cable from the unit and just cut the darned thing rather than trying to feed it through the channel i wish i could recommend a better cable management unit if i find one i 'll amend this review to include it save your money buy something else
i purchase quite a bit of equipment for my company and i have to say this was one of the more disappointing ones the deficiencies in this printer are only exaggerated by epson 's non english speaking technical people and on top of that epson agrees there are issues that reduce the unit 's capabilities wait until you have to replace all 8 cartriges when all you need is black the drivers do n't let you specify there is an after market driver available but get ready to put out 600 then you have to usually special order those 8 cartriges i could go on and on but it would just take less time to buy a different printer
i made the mistake of ordering one of these i took it out of the box and laminated one page that came out with a bent corner luckily it was n't an important document or anything so i printed another page and tried to laminate it the machine would not feed at all i called the manufacturer who stated i would need to mail it in at my expense and they would take a week or two to fix it so i exchanged it instead on amazon and got a new one it worked for about three weeks still often have problems with corners being bent and then it got stuck with a page half way through needless to say do n't waste your time and money getting aggravated with this machine it 's too late for me to return this to amazon so i 'm basically throwing this away and buying a real laminating machine
i finally realize why they do n't include this with the pro sling box because the value it adds is practically 0. the resulting picture is actually worse than the component output i have an hd cable box that outputs converted signals and downsampled picture was actually better than the straight resampled hd signal that this cable outputs the picture is small and it is not noticably better than the component output in hindsight the pro box is really not necessary since the hd cable does not add its advertised value
having grown up with rand mcnally maps on seemingly all my classroom walls in the family atlas etc i was predisposed to like the magellan gps system however the lack of even the slightest intention to support the lonely but from what i can gather creative and 2.5 of us that use mac 's back it went i guess those guys are still living in the world of the classroom wall despite their venture in gps land tom tom garmin here i come
this product is not for users with nforce chipsets i see users complaining that this product hangs and the keyboard acts up you have an nforce chipset on your motherboard if you are a fan of amd and use their processors hence a likely nforce chipset stay away from this product because it will not work right ! aside from having to install a separate usb card to get it to work which i can not do for my laptop it has performed quite well i read many reviews about the audio quality and i tend to agree the audio will clip if i turn my pc volume up over the halfway mark this is easily resolved by keeping the volume low and turning your powered speakers up i would hesitate to buy another iogear product in the future without extensive compatability research before hand
pleasant to the eye pretty sturdy construction small but only uses 4 out of 5 shelves if you want to use it for dvds ! i like the rack but think it is overpriced ! with shipping it was way too much money for what it is
even when i realized that it were merely a storage device not a reader disk stakka still seemed interesting but then within 5 minutes i realized it could n't eject any disc i inserted after calling they suggested an automatic calibration '' probably because the plate must have been misaligned with the ejecting slot '' it worked at first but started to fail after another 5 minutes surprisingly '' the device again a 10 minutes process worked for the next 2 ejects afterwards it refused to eject unless you calibrate it '' again i asked for a replacement unit to and they said that since i 've bought it online on ebay it was sealed and brand new mind this they could n't do anything to help me by the way they do n't offer any kind of repair service on this product even if you 're willing to pay like me if it breaks on you you 're on your own
i purchased 4 of these units and 3 were either doa or had to be returned because of assorted defects i replaced them with the media carousels by ziotek the software from ziotek is not as sophisticated as disc stakka 's but ziotek 's units are a higher quality product and hold more dvds
it gets stuck just when you need a disk stay away from this device missed ejected disk references you will feel really pissed off in front of a such piece of junk with no way to get your disks a hammer is an smart option as a recovery tool
stay away from these devices ! i bought 6 of them and 3 of them are already having problems 1 unit alone has logged over 92 errors and i ca n't get imation to do anything about it they come with a 1 year warranty you must email them for support i have emailed 20 times with no response if you call the imation hq in missouri they will not accept support calls for this product you must go though the email website so in my option i wasted over 600 on this product it ai n't worth
the cable failed after a month no idea why but could be because it cost ten dollars oh well back to analog
this was the worst electronics puchase i 've ever made when i first got the mini it was great looked nice and sounded great within about 6 months battery life started to go way down after a year it was down to nothing did n't work properly would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes if you 're going to take a chance on an ipod definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one
i had my pink ipod mini since 2005. it was fine until it died the next year on the exact day i got it and the warranty ran out i got it repaired at an apple reseller and then it died again on the warranty expiration date what is it with the ipods it 's like they have a self destruct inside !
i am not the first person to have this problem what i received was in fact a which is not at all the same as a because it does not have linux drivers then i had to go to the trouble of calling haupauge to get them to switch it out had to pay shipping to send them the 150. more than a week went by before i was able to build my mythtv box
no it 's not amazon amazon sent me what they thought was a real since hauppauge says so on the box however it has another card in the box fine it 's a better card but not what i need so i send it back to hauppauge to get a real that was like 3 weeks ago where is my damn card ! !
when you view the technical details for this product it indicates that a battery box is included with the mic even shows the weight of the battery box that 's supposed to come in the mic this information is incorrect the battery box only comes with the more expensive models not this one please make sure not to buy this product unless you have a source that can power this mic because without the battery box or a source that can power it the mic is useless
i read most of the reviews of this phone and agree with them i would never buy another ge phone in fact i am waiting for my new uniden cordless phone to arrive from amazon in the meantime i tried this experiment yesterday i took the battery out of the phone then sprayed the keys and talk button in front with 409 orange power i really doused it good after that i blasted the phone with steaming hot water so much so that the screen fogged up now after that i shook the excess water out and duct taped the phone to a fan with the buttons facing the fan today i hooked the battery back up put everything back together and tried it it worked fine even without a charge i did n't have to keep pressing the same number 3 times to get it to register it worked similar to when it was new i 've done this with stereo receivers by taking the cover off putting them in the bathtub squirting them with a spray cleaner and blasting them with a hot shower then i put them in between two fans for three days after that they work fine i 'm sure i 'm not the first person to do this just make sure you do n't have the unit plugged in when you do this or you 'll get shocking results try it ! what have you got to lose
bought one of these phones like everyone else followed all instructions exactly after less than 1 year battery wo n't hold charge and phone keys have to be pressed numerous times to dial just bought brand new battery and followed charging recommendations before attempting use it does n't work headed for the garbage do n't buy this and waste your money
this phone is a total piece of junk and a waste of money as others have described the battery holds maybe 5 minutes of a charge forget about it if you do n't set it back on the charger when you hang up the next time you dial it 'll be dead i 'm talking within minutes the beeps are indeed annoying as is the ring and the overall volume i ca n't get a new cordless fast
this phone sucks the battery does n't hold the charge resulting in dropped calls and major aggravation ge should be embarrased to offer such a piece of junk do not fall for this phone because it is inexpensive as i did you 'll end up spending a ton of money on new battery packs or having to buy a new phone in just a few months as i am about to do today this time i 'm going panasonic ! fyi my ge refridgerator is also a piece of cra
the product description says '' includes drivers for mac os 9.1 and later and for windows this is a lie once you get the product set it up fail to install and go to the web site it says does not support windows 98 '' who knows what they do support do n't buy it
the top half of this spool were terrible i ended up throwing every one of them away it kept reading bad media
i just got these dvd 's today and none of them work i have 2 memorex dvd drive witl the firmwere up to date a 2.4 and and the 2.4 burn error and the burns but the disk never reads i have tryed all speed be got no results i already wasted 5 out of 100 dvdr and i know none of them will work
i chose the belkin tunebase because reviews rated its sound quality as the best of the bunch i do n't dispute that but it 's by no means great think typical fm quality minus 25 every s '' or ting is replaced by static so more like 'fm as your driving out of the station 's range ' quality and that 's once you scour every frequency for the clearest i tried this with factory and expensive aftemarket car stereos in a variety of environments and was consistently disappointed but to clarify i 'm disappointed in the technology as a whole not just the brand belkin 's product has a great design and good user interface but it 's a solution if sound quality is remotely important to you
omg i got these headphones and they suck ! ! ! i am not even kidding they are probably the worst headphones in the world and the worst headphones i 've had in my life first of all when you listen to music there is a loud hissssss noise in the backround second these do n't even fit over your freakin ears haha also they are tooo bulky you ca n't do anything with them the sound quality is ok but if your looking for noise cancelling headphones i dont recommend these i recommend the sony fontopia headphones or the 120 dollar sony noise cancelling headphones that are ear buds and not too bulky availible at brookstones now those are what you call great these panasonic earfones are just horrible compared to these it only takes out like a little of the noise but the sony 120 dollar ones at brookstone takes out 70 of the noise ! that 's amazing it is probably why they are so expensive well i have to leave but this is my advice to you do n't ever ever buy these headphones in your life ! ! ! they are horrible ! ! ! hope this helped
i just purchased these headphones and i 'm not at all happy they have a cheap plastic look feel the sound is worse than what would be included with a 20 walkman the noise cancellation feature works as long as you do n't mind replacing ambient noise with the annoying hiss of white noise that the headphones produce i 'm not a negative person and have no gripe with panasonic i 'm just calling it as i see it
despues de una semana de uso el tv presento una falla y hasta la fecha ha sido imposible obtener el manual tecnico de sharp para proporcionarselo al tecnico por cuanto solo se lo venden a los tecnicos en venezuela no existe un tecnico autorizado
after owning a 20 '' aquos for over a year i decided on another purchase from this quality to my dismay after setting up this 32 '' i discovered the screen was damaged figuring this was an error in handling during transit i placed a replacement order pleased with the speed of turnaround i was horrified to then this one up and be unable to get a picture after troubleshooting until blue in the face ! i will continue to use amazon as they 've always been reliable in the past i just now hope that i get both refunds in a timely fashion
i went online to amazaon a site i trusted to locate an hd radio for my desk at work this was listed as an hd radio only after i received it opened it and plugged it in did i discover it is not an hd radio both the party vendor and amazon claim i have no right to a refund the fcc calls this fraud and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation
i ordered two of these coolers because they have the long lasting ball bearing fans they shipped the wrong model the cheaper one with the sleeve bearings tiger accepted my return but what a hassle because some warehouse goof ca n't read directions i still want drive coolers but i 'll try and get them from a more reliable source now
i bought my in europe and enjoyed it very much until time came to upgrade it the upgrade that i bought and paid 75 for will not work with my unit even though the people at garmin say it will i am being bounced back and forth between tech support in europe and north america to add insult to injury the last rep that i talked to in america was very rude this purchase was not worth the hassle and the ripoff that ensued
i 've owned this unit for about one year this unit suffers from 5 problems 1. the unit gives poor directions on a route from long island close to an entrance ramp onto the lie to a destination close to a different exit ramp off of the lie it told me to take local roads that 's 100 traffic lights i would hit over local roads i did not have any avoidances set in the settings this is not an isolated circumstance but it happens all the time in nyc in addition it 's constantly trying to take me over toll roads even though i set an avoidance to toll roads i get the feeling that the unit does not really know what toll roads are it also likes to take me over roads with lots traffic lights see previous paragraph although they might be the most direct this device does not take into account time wasted at traffic lights oy vey ! ! ! ! 2. the maps are not updated i tried to go to home depot through the business search function unfortunately when i arrived at the destination '' home depot was no where to be found 3. speech directions are often given too late to actually make the turn the unit also gives me turn directions after i 've already made the turn moreover the screen updates slowly after you 've made the turn you look at the unit and it still displays your position prior to making the turn 4. the unit processes so slow searching for businesses by is completely useless it literally takes 10 minutes to find an business by name its faster if i text google for the addresses with my treo and manually enter them into the 5. the input device is really cumbersome you really need a keyboard or touchscreen scrolling back and forth through numbers is a giant pain in addition this unit does not speak street names only left right turn bear i want to spend time looking at the road not trying to decipher directions on a tiny screen to figure out where to make the turn this unit is really useless at least in nyc where there are many roads i 've wanted to hurl this thing out my window on several occasions do n't waste your money on this buy something nicer that actually works or buy it from a store with a liberal return policy
what has happened to monster 's quality in i had a discount on monster cable through my employer and purchased close to 1000 retail prices worth of their cables for wiring up my home theater i have been using the gamelink with for my and that works great here it is 3 years later and i buy these gamelink 400 for use with my new hdtv with component inputs when i tried to install them i thought i was going to snap the connections off my tv because of the amount of force i had to exert with much determination i got them to connect i switched on the and experienced no video just sound i had even a harder time removing them when comparing these cables to my older gamelinks the differences are the new wires are lighter rigid and the connectors are definately too small in diameter in hand they feel cheaper compared to the heavier more pliable older wires i will no longer buy monster cables and i do not recommend these to anyone audioquest is much better too bad they do n't make gaming cables
they really do suck with many portable speakers in the range that sound pretty good these should fall in the five dollar range dont bother
the product could not be used with my rather standard setup ie macosx on apple with a pioneer burner i was told by the vendor that i might get it to work by downloading software from the web it turned out that the download was not a simple everyday variety but required a sophistication beyond my modest abilities my local apple vendor and repair facility advised me not to use the download they did not want to try it as well the product vendor was reluctant to provide a refund i might add that they dragged their feet for over about a two month period eventually they said they would provide a refund less a restocking fee i put the issue in dispute with mc
bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced scientific calculator apparently ti has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes i will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at ti 's website however the calculator is complicated to use and you almost need a course to learn how to use it furthermore the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you at the high price for these ti calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out but let me assure you they are definitely there and you would be better served to get a casio or hp graphing calculator instead
i have had a 256 mb 512 mb and a 1 gb jump drive sport i love these sturdy and reliable drives i was very dissapointed when i first used the 2 gb model the data transfer rate seems to be extremely slow its slow even when saving a plain text document ! i would buy again only if they improve the speed of this drive
i dont know if i like it because i never recieved i
i know that everyone else seems to love this so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini pink is a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge and my current playing time per charge no changing settings not backlighting nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies is about 2 hours apple will gladly sell me a new 70 battery but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products i 'm not saying do n't buy it there are n't realistically any better choices out there than the ipod but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me i think i 'm going to dig out my old discman
poor sound quality few features not too easy to program do n't waste your money
i had been using philips adapter that i got from walmart and was quite satisfied with it until the wire broke when it got entangled i bought this one just because it was maxell and i had to make 25 in order to qualify for free shipping but the moment i inserted it in my stereo i realized my mistake it sounded terrible the very same day i went to walmart and picked up philips adapter once again you can try others as well but dont even think about this one
i have n't listened to these yet and i 'm sure the sound quality is great however trying to get the grilles to fit on the speakers after installing them in the ceiling has just been the most frustrating job of my entire kitchen rehab
to be on an first come first serve order and they go fast
when they advertised big button '' i believed that they meant it but this is not i repeat not a big button phone if you are buying for a visully impaired person or even just because you do n't see as well as you used to you 're making a mistake
the screen is the most easily scratched part but this skin just has a big hole for the screen to show through nothing to protect it i do n't see the point in having this at all and will return it tomorrow a disappointment if anyone knows where to get the other type of skin that actually does have a clear plastic cover for the screen please be kind enough to share with the rest of us
i purchased this skin primarily to protect my ipod 's screen i 've seen other skins with clear plastic shields to cover the delicate screen area and assumed that this one would have something similar it doesn't
i used an 880 to hook up my equipment a tv dvd player vcr amplifier and an xbox there was a power outage in my community after power was restored the vcr and xbox would not power up everything else connected to the 880 worked fine i had my vcr and xbox checked out and both were fried by the power surge i submitted a warranty to cyberpower and got a new 880 in the mail immediately the warranty process was very smooth and very quick cyberpower paid me 50 of what i originally paid for the vcr and xbox their warranty clearly states that they will only pay fair market value of the damaged equipment on one hand i ca n't recommend cyberpower because i got a defective surge suppressor but on the other hand the warranty claim process was pretty smooth i was lucky i kept the receipts for the 880 my vcr and my xbox i definitely would n't recommend connecting your most valuable electronics with this surge suppressor you should consider a ups even if it 's just for surge suppression the circuitry in ups is much better than surge suppressor outlets
i have the same code set for my county but the alert only goes off about half the time also before you go to sleep you must determine if the weather is threatening enough to justify setting the audible alarm i hate to woken up for every thunderstorm warning
the micro has some excellent features at the right price but it fails to work all the time first it was the firmware then it would n't connect to my pc now the hardware has failed i am going to buy an i pod despite apple 's refusal to allow other forms of downloads
i 've had my micro for over a year now and when it worked i loved it ! however i 'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue the sound is output in layers and i am constantly trying to reposition '' my headphones to get full sound my husband called creative labs for assistance and he was told that it would cost him per month for a customer service subscription '' after reading these reviews it seems we 'd be paying creative labs so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can or will do next brand please
this item did n't help my toshiba laptop but that 's probably more the laptop 's fault the fans are faulty and overheat like in every toshiba laptop but the notebook cooler did n't help at all
to be sure this arm would fit i visited the manufacturers website and chose my exact lcd model number in their menu system my tv model number supposedly matched this arm and the correct mount adapter was supposed to be included as well the manufacturers website stated that this mount came with the adapter plate for a x vesa compliant tv it did not it came only with a x on top of that luckily before we tried to get the manufacturer to send us the plate for free considering their false claims we noticed that the screws meant for the plate also do not work they are too small and can be inserted into the back of the tv with your hand i am very frustrated one would think that going to the manufacturers website would safeguard against this sort of thing i will never buy from this company again
this unit is easy to set up and get running initially it 's the perpetual irritation and disfunctionality that occur afterwords that make this such a useless piece of i bought this upon the recommendation of a friend he warned me however to have a backup like a cd player because this thing was irritating '' i had mine hooked up to my wireless network for about a week before i finally took it for a very rough but long overdue final trip to the trash the only thing i 'm still wondering about is why my friend a notably intelligent mechanical engineer felt that this irritation was worthwhile during the aforementioned week of audiophilic agony i can honestly say that this device functioned on demand less than 30 of the time i ca n't even begin to desribe all of the irritating episodes that occurred bizarre inexplicable conflicts with other previously installed devices on my network saying it 's doing one thing like playing a song while actually doing another not playing a song etc this gadget will surely put your wireless network enginnering skills to the test do n't really have any oh well sorry for your bad luck i could easily waste the next hour of your time telling more horror stories i 'd prefer not to do that however in this case i 'd rather think of myself as the robin hood of the technologically skeptical crowd '' i personally listen to music for relaxation not irritation i 've not tried other wireless music streaming devices but do yourself a favor skip this one and find an alternative it 's hard to imagine one does n't exist even if it means reverting to your single cd player if you find reloading a 5 cd changer to be too much of a pain in the just try to remember the good 'ole days when you 'd glady flip and dust that scratchy lp every minutes just to enjoy the other side
with serious sirius reception problems in my office and no option to mount outside i looked to this antenna to help solve the problem adverstised dimensions as 11.1 x 2.4 x 6.0 inches 10.7 ounces i thought i was ordering a huge monster antenna the dimensions must be the size of the package it 's actually about the same size as the sirius stock antenna with no appreciable improvement in signal reception not worth the price and falsely advertised by amazon
i bought this product as a gift for some friends following the directions carefully they were only able to get one of the speakers to work and that intermittantly after i got the speaker system back from them i gave it a try bad results worse this time only static from one speaker i double checked to make sure that i had installed everything correctly including making sure that the correct power adapters were attached to the speakers no go and then when i went to return it to the company from whom i bought it in canada i got the royal run around finally after lots of phone calls and mail issues do n't get me started on customs '' issues i returned the product and got the price of the speakers back however no refund on shipping either way which amounted to about 89 total so two things 1 the product is shabby and not worth the price go to sharper image and buy theirs better product cheaper price and 2 never buy anything from that is not from an american supplier
the transmitter light when connected to the transmitter adapter and then plugged into the power will not stay on it fades out and then nothing is possible i spent a lot of time trying to get them to work going to radio shack and finally returned them the replacement was exactly the same problem there will not be a third time ! bad bad bad
much like the description in most of the other reviews for this product my experience with these wireless speakers was dismal initially they worked in an acceptable manner though the sound quality was only a couple of steps above poor with lots of buzz and muddiness i chalked that up to interference as i 've had some problems with other wireless signals in my house and to the fact that i decided to go for the budget price rather than search for quality it was n't a major issue though as i was using them in my garage and not very often i could live with the poor sound quality then my wife asked if we could try them in our upstairs bedroom so that we could listen to our christmas music at night they worked fairly well there too at first though when the phone rang while i was setting them up i discovered that the cordless phone totally destroys the signal and you get nothing but incredibly annoying static to be fair the product documentation does state that other wireless signals might interfere '' we were able to listen to them for two days then the signal stopped at first i thought it was the cable box shutting off automatically we were listening to the cable music channel but there was still no signal after i turned it back on then i checked the rca transmitter no power light i checked the plug yep plugged in i checked the power cord connection to the transmitter yep seated properly i disconnected it and reconnected it ! the power light came back on ! ! ! and then it faded out no power i tried it again several times if you keep doing it it will eventually fix itself right same result each time so i took the transmitter apart figuring there must be a loose connection inside nope everything solid as a rock okay so it must be the power cord ! the wire probably got damaged in shipping and it just took being moved around a few times before it gave out completely '' i thought i 'll just pop over to radio shack and get a new one '' radio shack man dc transformer never seen anything like that ! we do n't even have anything close ca n't help you call rca '' me thanks '' rca support website that part number is not in our database '' reply to my to rca support sorry you 're having trouble please call our 800 number '' support that part number is not in our database oh it 's an advent product ! you have to go to advent support '' me but it says rca on the product '' them yessir but it 's an advent product i 'll give you their support number '' me to rca support thanks '' me to myself forget this ! i 'm going to amazon to look for something else ! ! ! ! '' too bad i did n't check the reviews here first
i purchased these speakers about a year ago if you 'd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example i 'm on amazon right now buying replacements another brand for these that have completely failed they worked fine at first then got fuzzier one quit completely tonight no the other still works '' with lots of fuzz i find myself the signal a lot time for a replacement if you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand i 'm trying the acoustic research now they supposedly have better range do n't settle for cheap unless you have to you 'll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long ! do n't say we did n't warn you
great design but unfortunately would n't stay stuck in cold temperatures i have a saturn and the vent clip was not an option for me
loved the idea of being able to clip the ipod mount to the dash vents unfortunately the execution of this concept was lacking in this product the clips held to the vents but they fell off the back of the mount we have gone with plan b '' and used the self adhesive mount directly on the dash sticks well but ca n't see the ipod once it is in the mount well at least we can keep out eyes on the road with one less distraction
i did n't like it first i asked for a nano ipod holder and when i send the sellers a mail asking if my nano will fit they never answer now i have it and of course is to big to hold my ipod nano it is n't for all ipods '' like the web said and it is n't a solid item also it brokes easily
i received the cartridge however it was a bad one they said they would send postage to send it back and when they received it they would send a new one i still have not received a new one and i have not heard from the company it has been quite a while i will not be buying products from this company again
great idea that does n't live up to it 's hype two issues it steals the usb ports completely and often causes problems with one 's computer more importantly it does n't cool down drinks or even maintain them they usually warm up to room temperature within an hour whether on the coolit or not disappointing performance
the coolit usb beverage chiller is a great idea with execution it only keeps the bottom part of the beverage cold and not so much that you would notice a difference the fan is loud an unimpressive product i 'm sending mine back
the chiller doesnt get it a bit cold feels like a fan blowing air at it wish they made it better as it is a great idea
i was excited about this product and could n't wait to get it got one on christmas and well hmmm after trying it out a couple days i 'm pretty dissapointed i use it in a usb 2.0 and while the plate is pretty cold the beverage is not i tried it in a glass then in a can thinking the aluminum would conduct the cold better the difference is almost negligible it barely keeps an already cold beverage cool and certainly does n't cool a room temperature beverage even after sitting on the unit for an hour it will be somewhat cool if the volume of liquid is very low an inch or less a rather neat idea that just did n't totally come to fruition you 're better off just using a beverage cozy
unfortunately i never got to use it as the ipod would not charge looked very cute but never got to use it returning for a
i order online from there company they send me broken box i want to return but they say if you return they will charge you for the money i pay for 500 dollars for this then i go home i use that speaker website say it can connect to muvo player i try but it not work they send me problem speaker ! !
total waste of money unless the only thing you want to do with this system is connect it to another creative labs product like one of their pc cards this system can not be connected with anything else be warned
the amazon compatibility block says it works with sportrak color but the online magellan site for getting an unlock code does n't provide an option other than for sd cards which the sportrak does n't use go with garmin i have run into more weird documentation and support issues with magellan than i can name
lost my color merridian overboard and had to replace the gps when i recieved the new gps i called magellan to get a new unlock code so i could load the charts on my replacement gps i was informed i would have to purchase a new bluenav cd since they only issue one unlock code with no exceptions well my exception is i will never buy another magellan product hardware software as for the replacement color merridian it is being returned today in the future i will purchase garmin
the map is old and there is no way to update the information annually with published changes obtaining an unlock code is an involved process with a long wait for technical support by phone
pros good weight easy to use top port useful for flash drives etc cons mine died after a month of use super skinny usb cable looks fragile if the cable wears out the hub becomes useless ! i did n't care for how much the ports on the back flared out
i 'll begin by saying that i definitely do not recommend this hub after about 2 months it completely malfunctioned my pc no longer recognized devices that were connected via the hub the indicators also stopped illuminating i replaced it promptly with a and have not had any problems the has been in service for about 7 months i 'll end by saying that i definitely do not recommend this hub ! ! ! ! good luck with your
i did not see any picture quality improvement using this high priced monster cable i get the same quality pictures from my 8.00 cable bought from biglots so purchased a hdmi cable but believe me the picture quality from my cheap component cable is still good eventhough hdmi pictures are little better when i compared with the pictures from hdmi cable
i bought this card only and only for chess game and there is none on it
although the games on the card are good most of the itmes on it like klondike and slots are outdated the games can not be moved off the card and can not be updated to the current version s you would be better off buying the games seperately
i bought this hp ipaq 2795 pda few weeks ago initially it intermittently started to freeze and also could n't work with bluetooth so i called hp 's customer service they asked to upgrade the rom through some online instructions that upgrade deleted all the data that i saved on the device and i got a fresh start again it worked fine again for couple of days and it froze again while i was in the middle of a meeting this time i tried doing a hard reset and it did n't work so after the meeting it plugged it again to the cradle with ac power and the pda rebooted again and started working fine again it worked fine for another day and the screen froze again this time nothing is getting it out of this freezing i tried hard reset clean power reset described in the instructions book plugged it on the cradle and applied the ac power it 's not coming out of this freezing it 's in this state for the last 4 5 days now i 'm highly disappointed with the quality of this pda i bought one of the high end model from hp and i though it 'll work fine for me it 's embarrassing that a 470 pda is behaving like this one of my friend has a cheap palm tero and it never behaved this way i do n't want to go through that rom upgrade all the time and loose all my data and
now i see why this thing was only 20 retail its a piece of junk it takes forever to connect to a router that is only 10 feet away the highest download speed i achieved was 53 and i am on a 6 network the latest drivers at the site are 2 years old now i see why there was a big stack of them at the retail store they are trying to dump all the obselete junk on the consumers i took it back to exchange for a linksy
if you do n't like seeing the message unable to connect to preferred wireless network '' then do n't waste your time with this piece of crap i lose my internet connection once or twice every single time i 'm online the other computer in my network is a dell with a netgear card and i have not once lost my connection on it and the internet is much faster my computer is a new emachines but with this junky card and the internet is barely usable also the two computers are in adjacent rooms so range is not a factor at all they are both running off a linksys router i have had problems with other products as well i had a network bridge which i returned because after following all the instructions and calling tech support it just did n't work also before the linksys router i had a one for about two weeks before i returned it because of its very slow speeds and inability to maintain a connection do n't waste your time with if you are starting a network from scratch i would recommend getting all linksys components
purchased to do a full backup of my hard drive seemed to install just fine but backup procedure produces nothing but error messages wish i had tried the trial version first do n't buy this until you know for sure it will work with your system
tried acronis for about 6 weeks and finally went back to using xp pro 's prog the more than several problems i had with acronis making i spent a good part of 4 weeks following their tech support guidlines reinstalled the product at least 3 times it never was able to provide a backup with out an error message coming up finally the computer crashed and acronis would not let me access any files on the backup drive or my computer i had to xp pro been using xp pro 's backup program now for 3 weeks full backup and incremental backups and it has offered no errors
please be very careful when reading reviews of this product i have been using the home edition for months with all the latest patches installed and everything appears to work great it does it backups without any glitches most reviewers are talking about this part of the software a few days ago my windows installed got corrupted after a bios upgrade no worries i thought just restore my backup first the rescue cd did not work i just hangs on a black screen so i reinstalled windows and the acronis software i asked it to restore my latest backup and it said it was good to go it asked if it was ok to format my hard disk and reboot the machine i clicked ok and about 10 minutes later i get a message saying that the archive is corrupted i now lost all data on my hard disk and my backup is completely useless for months it has been doing backups without hinting at any problems but as soon as it formats your hard disk it does realize there is an issue many people have the same issue when i got some of my system installed again i did a test full backup then i did a check archive and it then did tell me that it was corrupted so it can not even backup a few gig and restore it just a few minutes later please do not buy this software it does not work i have spoken to their support department and they told me that the problem was with my machine and that i should take it to the nearest service centre i have 2 windows xp machines with completely different hardware and it is failing on both this is the only software that is having a problem on either machine
my wife bought one of these the cord was only a few feet long and ca n't be replaced it is into the phone with no connector the cord is so short it 's so inconvenient you wo n't want to use the phone at all do not buy this phone ! ! !
sounds except the phone has a permant cord that allows you to move about 2 feet from the wall it probably would never work on a this is not worth the trouble that it takes to unpack it and not to mention to add the batteries not included
i bought two of these phones mostly for the caller caller is hard to read unless you are in a well lit area and they have no light to help read the these phones also lack a call waiting feature so if your on the phone you ca n't tell who else is calling big problem i have with these phones is the fact that they have a permanently attached cord between the headset and the base so if you want to use a longer phone cord on the headset you ca n't change it the cord you plug into the phone jack on the wall is also permanently attached and ca n't be base on this phone is also very very light so if you use it as a table phone it is very easy to pull it off the table due to the short actual call clarity is pretty good but other than that your getting what you paid for a cheap phone
i bought this bose system thinking it would sound like a bose system i had befor but it does not i hooked this up to my 52 inch big screen to get the bose sound that did not happen my tv has a better sound than this bose i took it off the next day and put it in my room on my little tv it sounds better than my tv speakers but having a 500.00 sound system on a 200.00 dollar tv shoud sound better the base has no sound at all there is no adjustments for the treble or base if you going to buy bose get the complete 6 speaker sound system as this bose is no way worth the money i spent
for 500 bose sells an extremely pair of tv speakers that sound no better than your tv the acoustimass '' unit is apparently trying to be a subwoofer but maybe only dogs can hear it seriously i unplugged the two main speakers to hear what that big thing was supposed to do and all i heard was some muffled noise trust me i had it hooked up right i fell for the bose cinemate at the target demo wall where it sounded pretty good but once i hooked it up at home and compared it with my tv samsung 50 inch dlp speakers i realized it was a joke i took the advice of reviewer th below and bought the combination he recommends for the same price much much more value including better sound and the ability to play other audio sources like cds can you believe that this bose unit has absolutely no sound output controls you ca n't even adjust bass and treble i will admit however that the universal remote they provide worked great even emulating my motorola moxi dvr controls but that was the only thing i was sorry to send back
i bought it and used it for two days returned it on the third day very expensive for what you get the system does not come with an amplifier where you can adjust the sound the surround sound is and for 499 you do n't get that much returned it and changed for a sony which totally rocks ! ! do n't buy this you will be very dissapointed
bose cinemate experience first of all i have never purchased a bose product in my life lets just say that i always felt that bose products are overpriced well we just moved to a new house and i am about 80 done with completing a room in my basement for my main home theater samsung 56 '' dlp onkyo 700 series receiver polk and rbh speakers in the meantime we are watching a 32 '' lcd tv polaroid 3232 in our living room when i bought the polaroid for a ridiculously low price i knew it had a few expected shortcomings the major shortcoming is the horrible sound from the internal speakers think clock radio sound so on somewhat of a whim i did a little research here and cc i picked up a bose cinemate system for 499 tax i liked the bose for its small form factor clean look and sound let me mention that my wife is totally against having large speakers in the room that is what the basement is for and our vaulted ceilings really make it tough to have any type of large sound my wife does not want speaker wire running everywhere and is against having speakers in the room i really thought the bose would do the pros great form factor and size very easy setup good sound when watching dvd 's and cranking the volume cons no digital or component hookups only rca ! no ability to control individual sound settings treble bass etc lack of depth at low and mid ranges little to no bass through the subwoofer unless the tv volume is cranked up dvd 's sounded good when the volume was cranked but there was little improvement to listening to the tv at normal volume settings contrary to what bose claims we had a hard time hearing dialogue during tv shows and kept missing conversations when characters talked low or whispered the lack of digital inputs should have been a warning sign and the subwoofer '' is anything but unless you have the volume cranked i was really disappointed with the sound at normal volume levels as a test i hooked up my hk computer speakers 50 speakers directly to my tv and the sound quality was only slightly worse than the bose which cost over 450 more ! needless to say i packed up and returned the bose system for a full refund based on my budget i decided to go with onkyo 5.1 receiver polk audio bookshelf speakers sony powered 8 '' subwoofer i hooked that system up last night and it completely blows the bose away the polk speakers coupled with the subwoofer have a very clean crisp sound and have much more overall depth and range we no longer have to crank the volume to hear dialogue and there is much more in the process of getting a better system i saved about 150 my advice is to shop around you can do much better for 500
this system is very expensive but bose did n't even bother to put an optical input so that you can get the optimal sound from your dvd player i strongly think that bose likes to rip off consumers i say so because if they had placed an optical input then there would be very little difference between this system and their system a system that bose retails for twice as much money
i really wanted to love this little player and for the first 40 days or so i did i like the ipod too but i 'm a big emusic fan and i wanted a very portable player for my workouts that i could play my music with absolutely no digital rights management with the exception of the always klunky creative software i loved this player great form factor good sound and pretty easy to navigate now the really bad news while hooked up to my computer one day it simply stopped working i could not turn it on a completely dead unit days or so after purchase i contacted creative and that is when i started to feel like i was hooked up to a machine that repeatedly kicked me in the groin first i had to undergo about a week of back and forth emails trying to get me to fix what i knew was an unfixable problem they strongly suggested i return it to the reatiler but amazon said it was not returnable finally i recieved an rma number then i packaged up and shipped at my expense their defective product after another week they contacted me and now it is time for me to pay a 25 rma fee that is what you have to pay them for their defect so they give you a number to call toll free i think not unless you live in stillwater open on weekends to process their excessive fee think twice so that is where i am right now in the creative customer service jail certainly the detainees at guatanamo bay are getting better treatment hopefully they will ship me a new player that does n't break again immediately these guys will never be able to compete by treating their customers with such disregard
i have a 2 gb player which i like i wanted a player with more capacity so i ordered the 8 gb model i tried charging the device but it never seemed to take a full charge when i attached the device to my computer i got a message about invalid drivers for the device i looked at their online support and tried their suggestions but it did n't help i talked to creative zen phone support many times they seemed to be more interested in getting rid of me rather than helping me they would send me emails suggesting solutions and hang up as quickly as they could i updated windows motherboard drivers changed registry settings cleaned the drive and reset the device all to no avail i returned one device and got another just to see if the first device was defective it did n't help i tried the phone support again and they sent me the same emails i got before i finally gave up and am now looking at other higher capacity devices
uh somehow i ended up thinking this would be compatible with my canon when amazon was out of the regular cyan a little while back vaguely recall it even turning up when i searched amazon for the printer 's inks just found out the wo n't work as a substitute nope zero not compatible a couple printers like the only looks like amazon 's cleaned up whatever made the come up prior for those searching for the and particular printer 's inks now if canon could put an explicit warning in listings not to be silly and think photo cyan '' can be substituted for cyan '' and oh when i 'm printing 95 black text why the heck do all my expensive color inks get drained too i thought i had the cartridge dedicated to that use alone but that 's another story does make me even more darn unhappy with buying this unnecessarily in the first place though
almost the same name as the except for photos right no this will not work in the pixma printer be careful when you order this is for the pixma or pixma only
there is no problem with the card or capacity but when i compare my results with lexar card there is no difference in the time it takes to store the image once you click the camera ! ! ! yes restoring images from the card to computer is very fast compared to my card but while snapping photos there is no difference in speed this could be because of the camera or some other reason but my main reason to buy a card was to snap photos as fast as possible by the way i am using this card in nikon 5700 camera make sure that your camera supports the write acceleration technology he cf card will work there was no increase in speed over other cards
this device sums both channels and creates a mono version of whatever you are listening to sending this new mono version to the two pairs of headphones stereo separation is lost if that does n't bother you buy it to me it is essentially worthless due to this limitation
is there some reason we ca n't buy an isight anymore
i gave a one star to this item only because i could n't give a lower rating than that the image quality is very very bad we decided to return it in just the first half hour we started using it it does n't work properly with yahoo messenger and the image quality is very bad in skype
to the reviewer who was n't able to see his own image i recommend turning on the light in the room o pic is fine on my ibook running ox 4 but camera crashes yahoo msg constantly even with the downloaded driver from macally ! manual is useless only tells you that you can have other people view your image online duh ! what a shockingly innovative feature for a webcam op next time i will probably spend a little more and get a cam that will work properly with mac
it 's probably a great product but beware this is a kit not a kit as is implied by the listing and picture crucial 's website is more accurate showing a photo of 2 pieces as well as listing the item as if like me you want a single piece do not order this item
the usb and power cords come out very easily which ends up being dangerous for the hard drive file system the power cord kind of sags in the socket
this is a usb speakerphone of the worst quality i 've ever seen the sound quality is bad my partner can hardly hear what i said it is not the loudness but the echo i will not recommend this speakerphone to anyone
this locking system is garbage i have 20 of these for a set of 20 laptops that we use as a training lab 1 these locks are difficult to operate as all parts of the lock turn 2 the mechanism is difficult to work and prone to problems because of the way the on the back of the lock sits 3 we have had 3 of these locks freeze up no combination will open them 4 2 times i have had to use a hack saw to remove them from the laptop i recommend that you do not buy this lock ! !
this product needs serious help what use is it if the first time you try it your computer is locked and wo n't open no matter what you do do n't buy this product it 's too unreliable fortunately the thing was locked to my desk and not to a library table hopefully i can spend twice what i paid for it to get the damn thing back to where i started
the main problem was the filthy condition of the travel kit the outside was caked with a layer of dirt as if it had been sitting out in an open warehouse for a year or more no attempt had been made to clean up the product before it was shipped i notified amazon about the poor condition upon receipt in december 06 but received no reply
my purchase of bose headphones was the biggest waste of 100 since i was in vegas ! ! while the quality of the sound may be good the stupid rubber ear buds are worthless they will not i repeat not stay connected to the actual headphone you get three sizes the largest would perhaps work for shriek the smallest for alfred neuman after them falling off for the time i superglued them on to the headphone and sure enough after a couple of days of in and out of my pocket they too fell off ! whoever designed these probably drives a ford pinto one star is much much too generous for this product save you money
i like bose products i also think they are a good company overall but these phones are simply mediocre in sonics put them on and they sound good enough but they are inefficient and give the impression of clarity via softness they do not compare to 25 philips sonically the philips are incredible once you get the right sized ear bud on of course the same goes for the bose it is essential to find the bud for you '' or you 'll never see the merits to phones if you do n't think that finding the right sized bud is important try carefully using without any buds on and you 'll get tinny nothingness you can tell the difference between these two makes by hooking them up via a large headphone adapter to a regular stereo system no comparison the philips are truly premium at 25 against the near 100 you serve up for the bose again these phones are good at 25 they 'd be a fair value even so at just under 50 still they would not be as good as the philips at nearly 100 the bose are overpriced and in my opinion you are paying for all the tv advertising they do if you have money to burn you ca n't go too wrong with the bose but you can do better two stars because they do work but since i now have five pairs of philips i doubt i will ever use the bose again they are not a value for that look to the philips
these headphones sound terrible they have muddy and dull highs flat mids and over compensated lows they do not block any outside noise from coworkers or the train or airplane do not buy these if you can tell the difference between good products and bad if you drive a toyota or listen to pop music or think your ipod and its stock white headphones sound ok '' then by all means buy them otherwise look elsewhere i also own the shure and they are twice the price and 100 times better but not as easy to drop in and out
type it up print it out and all you get is a blank label could n't see the prin
this gps only work when you make no on the route you set before you start driving suppose it would work on marine but did n't test it yet this gps is for my friend i 've use others for 4 years and i do the testing on this one i never expect it would be sooooooooo slow to when you lost or miss a turn it just frozen there and doing nothing for you lost when you manually push it to sometime it 's working sometime it does n't seems all depend on if it happy and you do n't trouble it too smart with temper is n't it it may lead you to totally wrong direction my friend drive out from atlantic city to philadelphia set the destination to niagara falls but he was confused on the toll bridge then gps lead him back to atlantic city he drove on atlantic express way for a circle till he realize by himself it 's totally wrong way to his destination it took so long to start and in my testing 60 of the poi is out of date couple of restaurant is closeout and one of it closeout 5 years ago well seems it did a good job on record the history probably i lost the patient to do more testing at least it does n't working properly as my old navmin even the map of it is also out of date but i 'm very satisfy for the speed to load up and
disappointed it works great in the suburbs if there are n't a lot of streets close together way too slow in larger towns and cities also my unit 's antenna stopped working after a month i bought an external antenna and it works fine but i bought this unit for the compact size i wish i bought something else
it is small and light weight probably perfect for hikers i think the battery is supposed to last away from the car the software is pretty versatile and it lets you do a lot my biggest complaint is that it is very slow i 'll be typing in a name to help filter my destination choices and if it is more than miles away it takes forever for it to show up i end up not knowing if the destination say mcdonalds does n't exist nearby or if i just spelled it wrong additionally when i pass up a turn i do n't want to make it goes into recalculating '' then it finishes in time to tell me to turn right just as i 'm driving through the intersection '' recalculating '' again i think she does it on purpose this product would probably be fine for anyone who drives at half the speed limit
i used these headphones once after that the base would not stay powered on for more than 30 seconds i verified that i had the right ac adapter verified everything was turned on according to the manual and i still could n't keep it powered on tried switching to different outlets around the the computer and that did n't help there 's a reason these headphones are cheap they do n't work
ca n't evaluate ups could not access our area due to snow road closures so apparently the ups mailed '' the original headphones by regular mail they arrived the headphones busted the trouble to file a claim under the apparent curcumstances seems more than the paper to file a claim so i am just out the cost
the sound quality of these headphones is there was a pretty constant buzz or hum in the background i like the feature of using regular batteries no dying and waiting for them to recharge the headphones are very uncomfortable ! the strap is constantly pushing down on my head and pulling up on my ears i could n't wear them for very long without them giving me a headache
these are rca headphones what happened to the quality products that they used to put out i can tell you right now these are n't it many letdowns and very few if any advantages in these earphones spend your money and get something else the first problem with these earphone is how they fit and feel on your head since the phones do not feature a swiveling feature like seen in most other headphone sets you put them on your head and they feel like they 're going to fall off you have to constantly adjust the tuning dials to achieve a constant and clear signal the signal becomes distorted or ca n't be recieved at all if you go as far as an upstairs bedroom which is directly above the transmitter or anywhere in range other problems with reception include popping noises and static within a very short distance from the transmitter the automatic turn off is another feature which makes this model a poor choice if the sound source is too low such as a certain scene in a movie or something the headphones will shut off within seconds this will usually come as a big surprise to you when the volume level changes and you hear loud static coming from the speakers which will cause most people to jump and fall out of their chair from the surprise the last problem with these headphones is that the battery cover is very hard to get off and back on again after replacing the batteries due to the way the headphones are attached so tightly to the band you have to fight with the cover to get it up and through the band save your money and go for something else
i bought these at a local store but i took them back because when you wear them there is a strap that hugs tightly to your head and actually presses down against your head considerably this is uncomfortable and would really suck for someone like me since i 'm prone to getting headaches i did n't even bother seeing how well these headphones worked because even if they worked perfectly i would n't have wanted to keep them
i purchased these headphones a couple of months ago even after reading the negative feedback i wish i would have listened the headphones really do automatically when the music stops or when the audio is at a low level such as a very quite scene in a movie there is also a constant low level hiss in the background i know it is tempting to buy these because of the cheap price but it really is worth it to spend a little more money on a higher quality set of wireless headphones
ok i was ecstatic when i first thought about getting wireless headphones i mean the idea is perfect is it not you get to walk around your home and do anything you like while listening to anything from any source without being tied down by wires ! it 's like a dream come true so i looked online and found this rca model i went out and purchased it and i was very disappointed the reviews here all have compliments about the headphones but i live in san francisco where it 's very crowded and most houses are attached to one another so there 's alot of interference i did n't hear any of the loud static noise everyone keeps talking about that resulted from the auto shut off feature what i did hear was a spanish radio station and just some static strange huh as for the reception i hooked up the phones to my stereo played a cd and the sound was awful i could barely hear the music with all the static i tried using the channel wheel which helped but as i moved around i had to keep turning that stupid channel wheel which is very fustrating i recommend that you look for models with automatic channel tuning so you wo n't have to deal with this when i did stay still and had a good signal the sound quality was n't very good anyways my sony earbuds are way more superior than these full sized headphones it 's very noticeable the phones sounds on par with cordless telephones but with much more static and if you 're wondering the phones can be connected to your tv yes it can it has an included cable that connects to the audio output on your but i was disappointed here too the reason i wanted to get wireless headphones were so i can use them to watch tv or movies very loudly while not disturbing anyone i thought the phones would cut off the tv speakers and only play the sound through the phones but no it played in both and since i could barely hear any sound from the phones i had to turn the volume up on the tv so it got loud enough that i could hear it throughout the house so that feature goes down the toilet if you really want wireless headphones i think waiting a few years would be best the technology will provide much better models than these and will probably be cheaper too the only good thing i can say about the rca ones is that they look nice and are comfortable to wear mine 's had a silver casing which stood out from the black models but even that has its flaws the base unit feels so light and weightless that you just wonder if it 's doing anything at all and sometimes one little tug would send the base falling to the ground from wherever it is thank you for reading my review and i hope you find better models out there good luck
this looked like the perfect solution for using my ipod video in my car for extended periods however this was not to be the case the first problem i had was that as a few other people have mentioned the plug was too large to fit firmly into the ipod when it was in the case that i have for it i could manage to get it in but only with some jiggling the second problem i had was that the sound quality from this thing is awful there is a substantial amount of buzzing and hissing caused by interference from the vehicle i ended up returning this item for a refund and purchasing the dlo autopod car charger which works just fine the dlo is just a charger and does n't have the plug
i was so disappointed in the fact that the guitar did n't come with any picks or a i did n't realize it when ordering or i would have ordered that too my son had trouble holding it without the strap when i finally got around to buying those items i showed the guitar to my brother who has been playing for 30 years and he said it did n't stay tuned once you play a chord it goes out of tune i 'm not thrilled to say the least
i purchased the backpack and thought the many compartments would be great however there is not as much room for documents and folders and i thought the padding is great for laptop protection the backpack is very heavy and hurts my back when carrying through an style and look is good function is poor
as a test to make sure of the range for recording a meetng i did the following the recorder failed completely i turned the to a normal level at eight feet away the only playback was static the recorders did not pick up the sound until i was six feet away the only way it might be used in a meeting is if you only wanted to record one person and you placed the recorder immediately next to that speaker also it does not automatically stop at the end of rewind
the only possible attraction to this gizmo is the price with that said it is still over priced i purchased my coby player from a local sporting goods store because i did n't want to pay a lot for a new player i just had a really good one that i spent maybe 49 dollars for stolen and when i went to buy a new one they were priced around 80 90 and up i went with this cheapo item and paid about 36 hoping that if i lose it or get it stolen again it would n't be a big deal now i 'm begging someone please take it i used it for a few days and did not like the difficult screen menus you have to scroll with a toggle switch several times just to get to a menu that enables you to play music the toggling is not intuitive and you have to jar it several times before it actually moves once the view is less that an inch tall and so you really ca n't see what your playing long story short before anyone got a chance to steal this one it stopped working completely in a couple of weeks i just took it back to the store for a refund of my money it is well worth it to spend another 10 or 20 dollars and get a decent player
this item was great for the few months that it worked i liked how i could just plug it straight into a usb port to transfer music i had just started using its voice recording function when it stopped working i was able to record a lecture and do an interview with it it seemed to me to have a good range and playback i typically did n't use the earphones but rather plugged it into my tape player in my vehicle a drawback perhaps is that songs are listed sequentially so it is not possible to select a menu choose your favorite artist and then choose a specific song from that artist but i did n't mind that so much the major flaw was that it stopped working the coby screen flashes on and off never getting to the point where i can play any music i can still use it as a thumb drive to store media if i want but it 's a bit bulkier than my other ones when i contacted coby about doing a reboot i was told how to reboot it but that it was out of the short warranty period i know that no device is going to last forever but i think that i 'd like an player to last longer than 4 months
alright first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing it started off when i 'd just walk around that it would turn off but now sometimes i barely touch it and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off it is not easy to use if you 're a hold button person if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer it will not let you delete or add music which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist also the headphones that come with it are really not worth it they are really really bad so go buy some nice sony ones and the song switcher thinger is a little defective it 's neat but you can push it down and it 'll hit something inside of the player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my player whenever its in my pocket or something i think thats about it i would n't recommend it unless you want a cheap piece of
while i enjoyed this little light weight gizmo while it lasted it did n't last very long within the span of a month it was pushing up daisies not playing not responding not acessable through any computer pc or mac i used it mostly during my mile walks to and from work and trips to the grocery store neither could be considered extream environments
i 've been using this radio for about six months now i do n't actually use it very often because of the poor reception i have an old cassette walkman that gets better fm reception and gets used more often the good points on this radio are 1 simple to use 2 small and light 3 only uses one aaa battery which lasts a long time and 4 has weather band however the fm reception is very poor signal separation is very poor even when listening to powerful local stations reception quality varies greatly with minor movement of the headphone cord in general acceptable reception is only possible in sites with careful positioning of the radio and headphone cord and while remaining immobile i plan to discard this unit and buy a sangean
while this radio has several cool features including vhf channels tv reception it disappoints when the listener is trying to tune into weaker fm stations it loses the signal or is overwhelmed by stronger stations when the wearer walks just a few yards if you only listen to stations with strong signals this is a good buy unfortunately i listen to the bay area npr station for which this radio is relatively useless it also does a poorer job indoors
the mouse works fine the keypad is pretty much crap the rubber things on the bottom came off the first time i used it and the plus and minus keys no longer work i have n't even tried all of the keypads functions yet to see if they work as i 've only had it about 2 weeks i 'm returning it i do like however that both the mouse and keypad have an auto off feature after a short period of not being used
i bought a sony digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor '' sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor services think twice before making your buying decision
ripped off by sony just purchased this for my daughter at college it records for less than a hour with the included card all higher capacity cards are incomatible and all compatible cards are out of production
the transaction went fine the product is comparatively far over priced i was almost drummed out '' of an organization where i am the secretary for spending that much on this item we have a competitor 's product for half the price that rivals this sony recorder do n't buy it !
what 's annoying about this solid recorder is that sony has n't elected to make it compatible with mac it records in a proprietary format which you ca n't convert out of or even play in mac and it 's not exactly easy to convert out of the msw format in windows either requiring multiple different downloads or an initial conversion to aiff with the provided software for a while i had to run virtual pc to get my recordings and that is just way too much hassle i used to love sony 's products but now i just wish they would work with other technologies in my workstream sony should look to how apple learned its lesson with interoperability
started to order this item at the listed price of 299 on checkout the price was 320 plus 22 more for handling and shipping
i have an unusual setup i have a laptop and a dell tower both hooked up to 2 evoluent vertical mice one left handed one right handed a microsoft ergo keyboard 4000 and a wacom intuous 3. the tablet simply does not work when connected through the kvm one of the mice consistently dies when connected through input 1. periodically the other mouse will die and the dead one will revive when switching un plugging and re plugging brings them back my mac ca n't recognise the microsoft keyboard through input 1 even though there is a driver installed for it and it recognizes it when it is directly connected ocaisionally the screen corrupts switching back and forth fixes it if you have a fancy setup like mine with lots of sensitive input devices splurge for something a little nicer
i was hoping some of the folks on this list could help me i hooked up the teac receiver to my cd player and speakers and it came on for about 5 seconds then the word protect '' appeared on the front panel and it just went off i tried it again after unplugging and same thing happened nothing in the manual 's troubleshooting section explains what this might mean has this happened to anyone else i 've replaced all the wires to my speakers and cd and bought a new surge protector but still no luck any ideas
the teac could use some improvements even considering its budget price i have several complaints from the moment i turn on the unit there is an ever present background hiss coming through the speakers it is especially noticeable during quiet passages in music or when listening at low volume levels the tuner sensitivity is very weak only the strongest local stations come in good one thing i find extremely annoying on this model is that some of the settings will always return to their default settings no matter where you put them for instance when you select fm mono it will return to stereo as soon as you change stations another is the tuning mode when you select manual tuning mode '' it will keep returning to preset tuning mode ! '' speaking of presets there are no numeric buttons for direct preset access on the unit or the remote so you have to scroll through them all to get to your station the volume control is another major issue it tends to jump around '' if you are trying to make fine adjustments to the volume it like most models today has the type where digital numbers appear on the display when you turn it i will have it set to 10 and want to go up just one or two as soon as i grab the knob it jumps '' down to 8 first i even had it jump to max volume while listening with headphones i almost threw my headphones across the room ! i prefer the older style volume control where you had a pointer on the knob with a numeric scale around it oh and while we 're on the subject of knobs here 's a neat trick make the control buttons round so that in your frontal product photos they will look like conventional knobs even though they are actually buttons ! to adjust the you must press the button then turn the volume knob to make the adjustments i hate this ! i like to just grab a single knob and tweak my settings not go through a two step process every time i want to make an adjustment another peculiarity is the sleep timer setup the scale counts down instead of up in other words if you want to set it for 20 minutes you have to press the button to go from 90 80 70 all the way down to 20. if the timer has counted down to 10 minutes and you want to add another 10 you must count down to 0 first and start over at 90 and count down until you get to 20 again ! i have never seen a sleep timer on any other device that works in reverse like this one they usually count up so if you want to add time you just press once or twice the functionality of the sleep timer is not usually a major consideration when i shop for gear but it just seems a little strange that they would design it that way another thing that is worth mentioning is that the phono input sensitivity seems a bit low i have to turn the volume control up to a fairly high level before getting a decent sound level when using my turntable and i have a phono cartridge with a high output level i originally purchased the sherwood but i returned it because it did not have phono input or tape monitoring see my review of the as far as sound quality goes i think the sherwood was a little better due to the hiss i mentioned on the teac however the tuner was just as weak on the sherwood i went with these models because my old receiver gave out and i was looking for an inexpensive model to tide me over until i could save some money for a more expensive model the teac fills the bill to some degree but i wish i had spent a little bit more and got one of the onkyo models at least they have numeric preset buttons and conventional knobs this review may be too much useless information for some people but i know the product specs and features list does n't always tell the whole story
in a word disappointing on phono input the treble is fine but if you 're looking for any kind of bass two dixie cups and a string would work as well if you 're thinking of purchasing this item set your expectations low
the jumpdrive worked fine for me for about a month and then it started acting weird it was recognized by the device manager as working properly but it did not show in my computer and was therefore inaccessible so was the jumpdrive there or not lexar live chat support attempted to help me but later resorted to sending me a resurrection tool via email with instructions after executing the tool and consequently losing my data it happened all over again five minutes later ! this is a little disappointing since this is the first usb drive i 've purchased and used i thought it would help with moving and storing files but it 's turning out to be more trouble than it 's worth
let me start out by saying that i love tivoli radios i have a model two with a model in my living room and truly love the warm rich sound along with the simple design and good looks i liked the model two so much that i decided to buy the model three for the bedroom even in mono mode the sound is rich and exceptional and the tuner truly does pull in and lock onto fm stations as advertised it looks beautiful and i had planned to order the companion speaker and have the ultimate clock radio the problem i have is that as at least one other reviewer has stated the back light for the clock dial is so bright that i have not been able to sleep since i got the radio four days ago i mean it is bright you can make shadow figures on the wall from the light it puts out i had to put a sock over the dial just to get some sleep now i feel foolish to have a 200.00 clock radio that i have to cover with a sock at night also the leds for the sleep and alarm function are bright enough alone to keep you awake if you use the sleep function the led stays on after the radio shuts off until you depress the button again and of course the alarm led stays on all the time the alarm is set since tivoli designed this to be a bedroom radio '' it is an inexcusable design flaw to not have include a means of toning down or disabling the back light for users that would prefer darkness while sleeping i have n't tried the snooze function yet so have n't experienced the snooze flaw '' other reviewers have but it sounds pretty scary one other clock flaw i experienced is that if i get home from work and go through my routine of getting everything ready for the next day before i settle in for the evening i discoverd that the 12 hour clock will sound the alarm if you try to set it for the next day within it seems a 2 hour window after the time you want to set the clock for the next day in other words if you have the alarm set to wake up at you ca n't activate the alarm until after this bothers me because i personally have over slept more often by simply forgetting to set the alarm in conclusion i can not recommend buying this clock radio until tivoli takes it back to the drawing board
i purchased a model 3 about two years ago i loved the wood finish and like the look of the controls and the sound quality of the radio is very good that said i have been remarkably unhappy with the product overall this is my first ever review on amazon because i felt so strongly about this product the initial and less significant complaint is that the grey on brown printed numbers on the control panel are basically illegible in all but very bright and direct light not what you typically have on your nightstand i 'm a guy in his early 30 's with good vision so this is not your grandpa complaining about this detail next the light in the clock was so bright that we kept a hanky on the nightstand to cover it at night however the real and totally unexpected failure of this product is the alarm clock itself 1. the alarm itself must be set by rotating a bezel ring that is pretty stiff and requires a good deal of force to turn my girlfriend hates it 2. the alarm is on a cycle so it will go off twice a day if you do n't remember to disable it by one of a couple of different knob twists required to the alarm 3. and the clincher the snooze does n't work like any other alarm i 've ever used if the alarm goes off whether waking to music or to an alarm tone and you press the snooze button after more than minutes of music the snooze will not work ! and you will actually be shutting off the alarm altogether often if i have a very early flight for example i will wake to music which will take a few minutes to really wake me up at which point i may want to snooze once for 10 minutes before getting up going to my knowledge this is pretty common alarm clock usage i discovered this flaw when i missed an early morning flight from sf to nyc because i did just that i pressed the snooze button once after what could not have been more than 2 minutes of music i had really done was shut the alarm down altogether needless to say after scrambling to get a later flight and rearrange meetings in nyc i called tivoli to tell them my radio was flawed i 'd bought direct the girl in customer service told me the radio was behaving normally that the snooze would actually serve only as an alarm shut off '' button if i waited more than about 3 minutes '' her words into the alarm to press it she also told me that this was normal and it 's the way all alarm clocks work '' i 've owned at least a half dozen alarm clocks in my life and have stayed in at least a hundred hotel rooms never have i seen a snooze button that really just shuts the alarm down and let 's you oversleep tivoli touts themselves as a manufacturer they acknowledge that this bizarre snooze system is in fact the way it works '' and go on to claim that this is normal for alarm clocks in general i can scarcely express how unimpressed i am with this company this product i 've now moved the tivoli model 3 to the kitchen and purchased a boston acoustics recepter for the nightstand the recepter 's alarm tuning controls are truly excellent especially the preset functions and aside from the audio being slightly we love the receptor ! ! ! oh and the snooze works great ! !
for me the main drawback of this unit as a clock radio lies in the primitive interaction between the radio and clock it is basically a clock attached to a time switch the radio has to be switched off by hand and the alarm set to go each night unlike a wall time switch but just like the traditional alarm clock you ca n't reset the alarm when turning the radio off in the morning because there is no distinction this might all be fine if you have never had a clock radio before but for the last 30 years or so the canonical design that works very well has been automatic switch on every morning with usually an hour or so of run time before automatic switch off set and forget the clock itself is rather small and difficult to tell the time from when i found the sound quality unremarkable for current table radios higher frequencies a bit too quickly and bass tended toward boxiness perhaps because of the bass port being tuned in an attempt to reach too low frequencies for the driver and cabinet combination in comparison with the boston acoustics recepter the latter had greater clarity and presence and a more pleasing bass though suffered slightly from bass boominess doubtless also from pushing the bass port tuning a bit far for functionality as a clock radio it wins hands down and the tivoli i 'm afraid has to go back
the radio is great the alarm problem seems to be fixed but the clock light is way too bright turning it toward the wall makes the wall too bright it 's more like a dim anyway if you 're handy like opening things up and willing to void the warrantee you can open it the tivoli model three and dim the light by physically covering up the bulb you need a standard phillips and a small screwdriver pliers can be helpful unplug and unscrew the six screws in back do the visible two first as they hold the computer board in place the front and back can now come out unplug the clock 's connection from the back of the unit it 's a standard power plug but you have to remove or cut some of the gummy holding material first remove the smaller cord snooze button from the clock that comes from the clock unscrew the three screws holding in the clock and maybe rotate slightly i do n't know if rotating is necessary but that 's how i did it pry out the clock toward the internal side of the clock with a little careful force there are plastic parts than seem pretty strong but be careful things will unclick and release under light force make sure the screw holders do n't get caught in the wires fm antenna wrapping around the clock now you can work on the clock unattached from the radio be careful with the unprotected clock arms you can hold the clock for the remainder of this procedure if you hit the hour hand it may come loose swing freely i did this do n't despair you can press it back down to lock it back in just be sure to synch it with the alarm and minute hand peel back a little of the foam insulating material around the whole edge of the back of the clock and a little more at 9 and 3 o'clock literally to reveal two screws unscrew and remove the back the clock by the way is a cheap guangzhou fuda 2039 '' without the electric motor and light it 's just like the kind of travel clock you buy from street vendors for 5 and it does run from the single battery shame on tivoli usually they 're so classy almost there remove the 4 small screws on the top of the back of the clock and remove that little part the light is on the front side of this part cover the light with electrical tape i would n't use black tape as it may cut all light or maybe some nail polish or or anything really the bulb is small so nimble fingers come in handy i covered the bulb with 2 small pieces of red electrical tape one of the top of the bulb and the other wrapping around holding the first in place works great reassemble everything the only tricky part is pressing the clock back into the front plate make sure the small useless wire is accessable be careful to line up the groves of the clear alarm face when pressing it back in and keep 12 high press gently and turn gentle until everything is lined up and then press the clock back in until it clicks make sure the three screw holes do n't get caught on the fm antenna wires plug the small wire back in the clock reconnect the clock power supply in the the back back and front together plug in and make sure everything works it should there 's nothing too hard especially if you 've ever opened up another electronic product and if you think this is crazy and expect your 200 clock radio to be great well you 're right but with a dimmer clock light a purchase becomes a clock radio ! but i 'd wait for the next generation when they 'll undoubtedly put in a better clock to match of quality to match their sound
i purchased this item a a reputable retailer in new york ny b h photo you could n't beat the price of 139.95 plus tax for a player with fm tuner and speakers i had a problem with the set up i was not able to install the music management program to get my music onto the player the player did not come with any cd so i installed the software as instructed by virgin 's customer support '' and as per the quick start manual i also updated the player with the latest firmware as per the instructions of customer support i still could not transfer my songs i 've them twice within 24 hours detailing my situation but all they wrote back was to do the same thing all over again as i explained abve they kept referring me to the web site but there is no link for the management software it only have the firmware updates and the player desktop update which does not contain the music management software the only thing that works is the fm tuner the player along with the speakers is a great deal for the money however given the fact that i can not put my music on it does n't make it worth it
please save yourself from this crap this is not worth even a penny i recvd it a couple of days back and opened the box today for the first use connected to the pc completed that really tough installation and started transferring the files and guess what it crashes all of a sudden ! ! ! i follow all the instructions in the faq section of virgin electronics but none works all the time it has only this piece of info to display oh dear ! this hard drive is n't working properly ! ! ! decided to return it do not even for a second think of taking this product save your hard earned money for some other worthy product ! ! !
i bought two one for me one for my son he is so disappointed and i 'm very upset i 'm happy i only opened one i guess you really have to be computer saavy to use this thing the instructions are useless the software did n't upload and i have windows xp so i know that was n't the issue unless you are a computer whiz save your money i wanted one for the both of us guess my son will only have one because now i have to go find a more expensive and user friendly one
the gps works great ! having said that i 'm disappointed with the 5919 overall i could not get the free map updates from tomtom because hp does not include the navigator 6 product code with the 5915. hp 's support promised they 'd get the maps and post them for 5915 users but that has n't happened after several months of promises the wireless worked only with networks and even then only for 1 day i have to perform a at least three times a day because the system hangs play fine it will play video albeit they are very choppy usb connections to the computer seem to work only after loading the very latest ms activesync and only after a even then having the computer recognize the device is very iffy '' the unit is a great idea if you travel maps email internet music contacts appointments but if it does n't work it becomes a paperweight i 've read dozens of forums with others complaining of the same issues hp support so far has been nothing but lip service my recommendation do n't fall for the marketing hype this unit still has to have a lot of bugs worked out
i used these batteries in a camera flash and they exploded leaving me with a paper weight try duracell a much more durable product
my friend bought these dvd 's so i could burn her wedding video not one of these dvd 's were recognized by my toshiba dvd burner i use velocity 's with no problem go figure
i bought these disks investing money and trust into the sony name i am sorely dissapointed in this purchase one out of every 4 or 5 disks actually shows up as a disk to be burned meaning that while i spent money on a 50 pack i actually got a 10 or 15 pack absolute trash do not buy this
right now i ca n't even get my burner to open because one of these dvd 's is in it caused an error while burning now stuck i thought for a few days that my burner was broken but figured out that it is the sony dvd 's i do n't get it either because my dvd burner is also sony you would think they would be compatible i am so annoyed that i bought two big stacks of these
i have used hp tdk fujifilm and jvc blank dvd 's and have had no problems but when i tried these sony dvd 's all i got were problems they suck a lot of other people seem to say that these are good but for me i 'm using an hp lightscribe dvd burner and these dvd 's suck they do not work do n't waste your money on these if i could give this product 0 stars i would
recently bought a spindle of a 50 pack of sony and all had errors i noticed other reviewers are using dvd identifier to see the real manufacture of black disks i downloaded dvd identifier and scanned a sony and what came up was sony recording media these blank disks are terrible all the disks had errors and half way through the burn process would produce errors stay away from these blank disks i recommend fuji disks whick scanned through dvd identifier is taiyo yuden and burn excellent and verbatim disks whick scanned through dvd identifier is mitsubishi chemical and these too burn excellently hope all this helps
was truly impressed by the quality of the pictures was less impresed by the software in the printer to manage pictures and print a bit confusing and slow the ultimate disappointment was seeing how at times the paper gets jammed which makes you lose precious ink and paper altogether i do n't think i would recommend
at first i was thrilled then i found that color matching was so the pics look washed out i tried to download the latest driver from epson 's site only to discover that it was mistakenly a scanner driver after i wrestled with the fact that the archive would n't extract after i contacted epson no less than six times a tech confirmed that she could n't extract it either and escalated me to a level one tech who said that that file extension needed to be changed to '' which did work why does epson not change it if they know it is a problem this last time it turned out to be the latest printer driver the nail in the coffin for this printer is that for no reason that epson can explain it started to crop all of the pics evenly on each side nothing i did would prevent it epson suggested using photoshop to increase the size of the pic a small percentage which is not exactly a pleasant thing to do with the hundreds of pics i print at bottom i think the problem is that mac functionality and support is an afterthought for epson
do n't buy this i bought it and it died within months just like the factory buy the new replacement it has now lasted me 2 years at least i did n't have the option when i bought this so i guess i ca n't fault them for selling it but now the option is here so do n't buy this
i have four panasonic phones with this dreadful battery everyone has been replaced at least once and two of these have failed again but no more ! there is good news and it does n't require you to build your own battery i bought the energizer replacement battery which is has much better amperage the panasonic 's and uses better battery technology nimh nicad and nicad is notorious for memory effect problems i will post a review of the energizer on its page but a quick result is that i now have two phones using the energizer and both work longer on a charge and a surprising difference is that the phone seems to work better at longer distances from the base ! not sure why perhaps the extra amperage but where i always have had some static using the same phone in the same room i now have clear reception ! i had been considering ditching these phones altogether but maybe the new energizer batteries will forestall that expense
this is just an awful battery it came as the oem battery on my panasonic phone the appears to have been used to power a host of other panasonic cordless phones as well the battery quickly stopped holding a charge i looked for alternatives and got an eveready nimh battery which at 1200 mah is a slight improvement but hey most nimh aa batteries are way better than that these days ! so i decided to make my own battery out of some 2500 mah eveready energizer nimh aa batteries it 's not that hard here 's how you do it first of all save the original battery that came with your phone study it the battery is essentially made of three aa batteries linked together in series linking batteries in series just requires that the minus pole of one battery contact the positive pole of the next battery and so on these links can be made by using wires or strips of metal take an exacto knife or something similar and away the outer plastic wrap of the battery the bottom part of this old battery will have a hard plastic frame that holds the three aa batteries together save this plastic frame for next note how the original three aa batteries are linked together the alignment of the three batteries is such that the one on the left will have the minus pole down the one in the middle will also have the minus pole down and the one on the right will have the positive pole down the plastic holder has two holes one in the middle and one on the right side to allow the middle battery 's minus pole to contact the handset 's spring leads and the right side battery 's positive pole to contact the handset 's spring leads ok so now all you 've got to do is figure out how to hook up the batteries in series so that these two battery poles end up at each end of this daisy chain series take heavy duty packing tape and some heavy duty aluminum foil the kind that comes in the large heavy duty lengths work fine and cut small inch strips tape the end of one such aluminum strip to the minus pole of what will be the left hand battery run this aluminum strip flush along the body of the left battery to the other end of the battery and tape the other end of the aluminum strip to the positive pole of the middle battery next tape these two batteries to the plastic frame holder and cover up the aluminum foil generously with some of the packing tape the next aluminum strip needs to run directly over the positive pole of the middle battery without making any electrical contact with it so the positive pole of this middle battery needs to be well covered with tape and insulated so tape down one end of a strip of aluminum foil to the top minus pole of the right hand battery and run the foil strip across the top of the middle battery and make contact with the bare positive pole of the left hand battery tape dowm the aluminum foil to the top of the left hand battery tape the right hand battery to the other two batteries and the frame and then wrap the whole group of three batteries in tape again just to make sure the whole thing stays together voila ! you 've made your own battery !
this transcend cf card was purchased along with a and they have not failed yet but the transcend cf card that i purchased a month earlier failed and i lost some very important images i was using it in my canon i tried several different software recovery programs to retreive the images and none of them worked i have tried to contact transcend technical support through their website but they failed to respond i do not recommend transcend cf cards this experience has taught me to pay a little more and stick with the proven brands sandisk lexar and kingston
my card started with 10 corrupt pictures from nikon after a few months it is no longer recognized in the camera or card readers emails to transcend have gone unanswered
i considered this card to shoot a wedding because being short on cash it seemed like a good value i researched a few websites and found some encouraging comments so i went ahead and purchased it what a mistake ! ! i filled up the whole with photos i use a canon eos and when i transferred the photos to the computer used 2 computers and 2 card readers i started getting hardware failure errors after errors and lost over a dozen precious photos needless to say i was majorly furious thankfully i like to be prepared and also carried my old and trustworthy 5 full stars sandisk ultra ii from now on i will stick to sandisk cards i 'll pay more but i know my photos will be safe
amazon shipped the wrong size notebook no problem returned the product amazon is a great merchant will buy from them again
phone broke after minimal use not a good shop phone the other reviews say it all stay away
i got one of these the sears craftsman version as a gift so the price was otherwise i 'd say it 's overpriced the maximum volume is much too low to be used in a noisy environment the handset is thick so if you hang it from your belt upside down because of how the belt clip is attached then you 're going to scrape it off and have it fall to the floor the keypad numbers are sealed but the buttons themselves are very small if this is really a shop phone then why is n't there some sort of bright flashing light that lets you know visually when a call is coming in if you 're wearing ear plugs or running a noisy tool you 'll never hear the ring i have n't found the extra battery to be necessary or usefull i think it 's just a gimmick to appeal to the cordless tool '' crowd i 'm sure that the spare '' battery wo n't last any longer than the one you leave permanently attached to the phone one supposed selling point for this phone is that you can put in a garage or shop where you have no phone line installed you can do this because it comes with a unit that you can plug in anywhere in the house there 's a phone jack do n't try to use this phone very far from the unit because its range is pretty low i 'm giving this phone only one star because it has some useless features is missing several other necessary features costs too much for what you get and does n't perform very well especially considering it 's billed as a specialized shop phone
this antenna does not fit the timex xm antenna port therefore you must guess which xm radios it might fit
been using the product for 6 months now battery time isnt great i constantly need to recharge the battery people always complain of an echo
i bought this product for my husband for christmas because he talks on the phone a lot with work the instructions say 8 hours of talk time however it only has 3 hours of talk time before it needs to be recharged so its a good product if you do n't need more than 3 hours of talk time but bad if you need it all day
heavy short battery life rechargeable batteries last a couple of months then need replacing i do not recommend this product
i work on a helpdesk where our employer purchased a set of along with a set of lifters for which i can not find a model number to allow us to move freely about the office while taking support calls while generally very functional they exhibit a few severe problems we have gone through a total of nine of them without resolving these issues the units will seemingly at random produce incredibly loud feedback to both sides of the connection this seems to be related to the phono jack on the remote unit but also depends on physical location some areas experience this more frequently than others so far air conditioning seems a likely cause the units will periodically bleed across channels changing channel on the remote unit or range on the base unit does not affect this you will be treated to static and the combined calls of all other units in the area typically until you replace the remote unit although the remote units appear to correct themselves after time they also exhibit frustratingly poor lifter response even after replacing our older lifters with this appears to be a duplexing problem when placing an outgoing call the lifter responds fine but if a call is being received then the signal used to ring the remote unit even if ringing is turned off appears to block the lift signal not only failing to answer the call but also preventing you from using the talk button for seconds afterward when this happens multiple times in a row it becomes entirely impossible to answer the phone at all i am very surprised to read so many favorable reviews after having replaced every single unit at least once we still find them to be barely adequate for our operations i do not believe that we have received defective units every single time nor that our environment is unusual in how we use them i recommend all potential buyers approach this product with caution
i found that the headset volume for this phone was low even when i adjusted the volume all the way up perhaps i could buy a better headset to fix this problem but why should i have to
i loved this cordless headset until i found another that was under fifty bucks which was just as good
it is to hard to set up with other tvs other then sony tv
this product will not program any tv or cable box in the house i have been using universal remotes for many years so i know what i 'm doing beware
well i 'm certainly disappointed i bought this for my mom who has advanced parkinson 's and ca n't control her hands easily when we received it my brother tried to set it up for her now my brother is a mechanical engineer who also works with computers and with four kids he has a lot of experience following obscure electronics directions as well ! after a number of wasted hours he was unable to program the item or make it work he tried it on three different televisions by three different manufacturers tried various types of batteries nothing would make the unit operate it 's not worth it for me to exchange it at this point so it is now in a remote '' location at the bottom of the trash can
i was so happy with the first dvd i played then the second and every next dvd would not load the player has never left my kitchen table no chance for abuse i sure hope i can return it it was expensice
do n't buy this case before reading this message this is a terrible waterproof case i used it once and for 5 minutes only ! ! ! ! i took it for my swimming lesson and in less than 5 minutes it drowned my ipod nano ! ! ! i complained at the otterbox web site but they did n't bother to answer me do n't buy this item you will be waisting your money
this phone system is now in a box where all my old and failed electronics go you could be 2 feet from the base and all handsets still sounded scratchy like an old cell phone i have a and a phone in the house and they work like a champ and have been where the uniden base was its not the location if i could give this product a zero star i would !
yes it is quick to pick up signal but has one major problem and i guess it is with drivers that it comes with i am using windows xp and it does not come out of hibernation if you hibernated the windows with this gps receiver connected i contacted holux support also and after number of emails back and forth they said that i have to ship the unit to them but i guess that this is a universal problem with this unit so if you want to hibernated and want to successfully resume from hibernation then disconnect this unit from the laptop first and then hibernated it if somebody comes across any solution please post here
how can they get away with selling this stuff first and foremost it does not work secondly it can make your disc worse look elsewhere do not buy this junk
do n't buy this item ! ! it does n't fix anything at all i followed the directions exactly did nothin what so ever to fix the scratches the only thing that one might be able to use is the blue stuff in the 2 bottle that can be used to wipe smudges off of cds besides that avoid at all costs !
i bought this repair kit so i could watch a rental movie it had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts after i was done i had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before
after reading the reviews on here i was hesitant to use the product i had just purchased but i figured what could i lose it was already skipping and if this did n't work i 'd just buy a new copy well i 'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important forget it the cd was left with more scratches than before the protective '' pad actually makes scratches worse than a paper towel and it 's just a horrible product i followed the directions to a thanks maxell for wasting my money and my time
this kit is absolutely horrible first off the cloths it comes with are n't at all they totally scratch the cd the step 1 scratch removal '' is not scratch removal at all it is supposed to sit for 5 minutes then you wipe it i let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there after you apply that junk the instructions say to apply step 2 cleaner polisher and sealer '' this stuff is practically water it does n't work at all after you do that the cd should be like new i do n't think so ! the holder that you put the cd on while you 're cleaning it is too flimsy the only good thing that i use the scratch remover '' for is small scratches on my digital camera cell phone psp and other electronics do not buy this unless you like ruining cd 's last word i hate maxell
it works and plays well but not made great some buttons you have to press twice to make it work call id works fine
this is a good phone except it has one major flaw which makes it unusable first off a minor flaw is that it is hard to pick up the reciever as it is locked in there i do n't like that another flaw is that while you are picking up and putting back the phone it makes a very high and loud screaming pitch this makes it almost deafening for someone on another phone in the house this phone will be going back asap because it is unusable stay away from this phone at all costs
its just worthless u cant hear your voice u have to shout and even wen u do the sound is veryy poor in quality the micrphones that come on any cheap headphones are muchhhhhhhhhhhh betteeerrrr dnt think about buying i
do n't buy this there are deaf toddlers who can record my voice better than this microphone
my husband bought me this microphone to replace a broken mike for my audiostream as 222 karaoke machine it works badly so i give it one star you ca n't hear anything out of this mike it 's going back to whence it came from buh bye
i had got this earlier and thought the piece was defective and so i did not hear any sound could not return as i had the receipt drycleaned ! so i got another one and the sound is audible only if i cup my hand and shout into it ! why on earth would sony design and sell this product this time i have the receipt and surely will return it
we just purchased this from a different vendor thank goodness we do n't have to deal with return shipping ! ! my husband plugged it in to a 350 boombox we also just purchased and we could n't hear his voice unless the volume was turned all the way up it also does n't have an switch with the boombox volume at a decent level nothing came through the microphone perhaps ours is defective but i think we 're going to spend a few more dollars and get one that actually works and has an switch yes it 's a microphone but we can do better with voice lessons
i bought this gigabeat last september i have n't used it that much but from the very beginning battery life was just annoying it does n't last more than 4 to 6 hours even though toshiba assures that it lasts 12 hours this is a terrible investment because i travel a lot and i want to listen to music for several hours i sent it back to toshiba for fixing but it is now exactly as it was so it 's not a problem of my specific device but of this product i chose toshiba because i trusted the brand name but i regret very much not having acquired an ipod instead
i bough this product after reading several reviews from other people pros toshiba gigabeat is really nice from the design perspective the look and feel is pleasant the software is well designed and pretty intutive though it does n't have the click wheel like ipod but i didnt find any problem using it and going through the various menus they are all well designed and are visually much more better than the or other similar players it takes some time to get use to the buttons and other controls but once you get accustomed then its a zip cons i returned this player after one week because the biggest killer to it is the battery life it hardly lasts for 6 hours you cant expect a player to last just 6 hour if i am outta my house i should be able to play it for at least 12 hours thats the only problem which i find with this which undid all its goodness overall a good player if you can live with a short battery life
i have only used this product for 3 days the power suddenly turned off and can never be turned on again i have to return it to amazon the bad thing is that i have loaded some my son 's video into it now i can not delete the files before the return
warning i received my hanns monitor over a month ago as of this date i am unable to get the 1440 x 900 resolution after searching several forum for information and doing as suggested downloading the driver directly from hanns it still will not convert to that resolution additionally adjusting the screen is on the side and very confusing with no directions included whatsoever to which buttons do what or how to use them in what order finally a forum suggested upgrading the bios which i will do in the next few days this is an extra unforseen cost and hazardous manuever if it goes wrong it destroys the functionality of my computer you can never use it again it 's buy a computer time mine is not a junk computer it 's a pentium 3 but 933 mhz 100 ghd and 1 gb memory frankly as i write this i 'm wondering why i have not returned it a few bucks more for an easier functioning monitor would be worth the trouble
the philips magnavox name is for good products but this is n't one of them ! the remote is easy to program and the light up feature makes channel surfing in the dark a breeze however i have only had my remote for six months and it already does n't work i found that the channel keys and volume keys were not responding when i pressed them i have found that this is a common problem with universal remotes as i have tried three or four different brands i also have to reprogram the control a lot for some reason if it is n't used in a while it loses the code that was programmed i also did n't like that the power button was right below the channel down button i often would turn the tv off by mistake when i just wanted to go back a channel ! spend a little more and order a new remote from the company who made your tv it will save you a lot of hassle and money in the end
these headphones are just plain horrible looks are very deceptive they look great out of the box but peformance is horrible when there is no audio and the switch is on it creates humming and is really unfcomfortable
reading erik mann 's review above was just like living my own experience i bought these headphones for their noise canceling ability attractive price small package and easy folding capability all these features definitely get a big thumbs up from me the sound however is very disappointing i used these with my ipod and took a good lot of time to try and adjust the sound various ways so i can enjoy it but to no avail the ipod stock earphones sound a lot better even on a plane if you lock them into your ear by twisting them so the pieces of wire shooting out of the ear buds points up towards your temples i guess i will just keep looking for better cans
i 've got a roadmate 800 something the gps is great when it works the suction cup mount and cradle it comes with likes to fall off the windshield therefore the gps unit hits the floor with the power cord still attached eventually the power end must have broken the small pin inside the unit that supplies power i bought the replacement and the unit works again magellan has a superior gps technology but design and durability is not that great i also have a tomtom unit that is easly upgradable and pretty stable on the windshield but the software does n't give me the same directions as the magellan but this is a review about the cradle what can i say if your cradle is broken you must buy this one but that does n't make it better just necessary
item was received bad not able to use and you refused to accept it back the response from amazon was to resell it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i also contacted the shipper and they also refused accepting the cradle back i have contacted magelan and so far nothing either credit my account or send me a working part ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i think i 've screwed over ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! dale nova
i received this tablet and it looked real good i loved it i pluged it in to the computer and put cd 's in and nothing the cd 's did nothing the wacom tablet does n't work so here i am with the tablet the mouse and the pen sitting by my computer and out the money wondering why i even bothered buying this thing in the first place n't try it because you might just get i did a wacom tablet that does n't work and then you are out the money plus figuring out how to get your money back or how to get in touch with the sellers ! ! i have tried and there are no answers anywhere there are no phone numbers to call for help numbers for trouble shooting you are on your own no return numbers or adresses you are left with this so think again before you waste your mone
this is an extremely cheap product poor grade of plastic and sound quality is for the lack of a better word gross ! the earbuds that came with my ipod are 10 times better ! it 's on it 's way back ! stay away
i previously had a black version and i lost them they were pretty much what everyone else says about them this pair was a joke everything sounded like a transistor radio no bass at all ! i tried them on all types of music and devices and finally gave up and returned them i have purchased another pair hopefully i 'll be back to the first set
i 've owned two pairs of these for over 4 years and used them in different environments house apartment and have to concur with others that it is nearly impossible to get a clean signal static popping cordless phone conversations from other houses apartments etc is the norm i 've also tried tuning across the variable spectrum with the same failed results they work for my purposes but i ca n't honestly recommend these to anyone
i 've had these speakers for about 3 years now and i 'm really not happy them there is some hissing but that is to be expected with wireless speakers the most annoying thing is the popping noises i have tried moving the speakers closer to the transmitter only to find that the distance makes no difference i thought the popping noise was some kind of local interference so i actually walked all around the yard but the noise stayed the same i got a warranty replacement of the transmitter because when i moved the attached antenna it caused static in the speakers and i thought perhaps the antenna was somehow not properly connected inside the housing but the popping noise persisted i ca n't recommend these speakers best to consider others
i agree with the previous reviewer there is a lot of static and interference with these things we actually hardly ever use them for that reason our house is small enough that we can hear the music from the other room through walls and doorways and at least it does n't sound like an am radio on a stormy day also they do have huge wall warts '' the big converters on the cords finding an inconspicuous place to plug them in is impossible since all the inconspicuous places are behind furniture which ca n't be put close to the wall anymore for the size of the things on the plugs i guess you get what you pay for i would have paid more if i had known how bad these would be
one month after purchase one speaker power supply burnt out the support company recton is bankrupt thomsen has taken over support but you need to return everything just to get a power supply cheaper to buy a power supply at radio shack i 'd suggest taking your money elsewhere
like others here i bought these to replace my ipod 's headphones after they got damaged i am completely unhappy with them here 's why 1. poor uneven sound quality in order for the sound to come through clearly they have to fit precisely in your ears although you get three different sizes of ear plugs it 's still a challenge to get them nestled in properly and they have a tendency to shift around and push themselves out of your ear 2. poor design the ear plugs that fit on the end of the earphones the translucent rubber pieces in the picture fall off at the slightest provocation although i 've only had these for three weeks i 'm already on my last of three sets of ear buds because they keep falling off and getting lost also the ear plugs have a tendency to fold inside out when you take them out of your ear which means that you have to flip them back before you put them back on 3. useless volume control the volume control will only play sound through both earphones if it is turned up the whole way if i turn it down any lower there is a sharp decrease in volume and sound cuts completely out of the left ear in summary these are poorly designed headphones that are more of a frustration than anything else look elsewhere for more comfortable better sounding headphones honestly apple 's ipod replacement earbuds are head and shoulders above these also the name is ridiculous smokin buds '' please
i recommend the type h for usage in cameras instead of type m as h is the high speed version a higher speed is more usefull when you try to take a couple of pictures in a short time or when you review the pictures already taken
this devise was defective it got very hot when plugged in to lighter i was lucky to discover this problem before there was a fire i threw it away ! ! i just can not take a chance on a product that fails in this manner a three dollar item just about took out my fifty thousand dollar navigator ! ! i went to fry 's ! becare with these low cost devices that may stay plugged in while you are not in your vehicle do risk a fire
i wore these yesterday for the first and last time i bought these headphones in hopes that they would stay in or at least near my ears when running they did n't last one minute they are very light but at the same time very flimsy the design does nothing in the way of supporting the buds in you ears like i had hoped the buds are set at an awkward angle and found myself having a hard time even when stationary keeping them in or on my ears as far as sound holding them on my ears they sounded terrific albeit very uncomfortable holding them in place also pretty much defeats the purpose of having headphones another thing to be noted the volume control on the cord is a terrible idea the volume pod itself probably weighs as much as the headphones unless the volume control is secured somehow it is very problematic doing any sort of activity these are probably what to expect out of a 10 set of headphones comfort sound design
these earphones are well put together and at the price they could be outstanding the volume control alone make them a steal the problem is that being behind the neck there is no adjustment for size you ca n't wear them while relaxing in a chair because when you lay your head back the earphones try to rip through the front of your ears add to this that there is no foam cushioning to the phones themselves and they are hard plastic circles than insert into your ears and it makes for pain unless your ears are large enough to accomodate inch discs inserted into them sideways like inserting dimes into your ears edgewise you will not like the feeling add to this the fact that the speakers face forward instead of into the ears and you have the problem of having to raise the volume higher than necessary so instead of a well designed product you have one that is badly designed from every aspect these could be great earphones if koss would make them adjustable reduce the size of the speakers and turn them 90 degrees so they direct the sound down the ear canal and finally add some foam padding to cushion the speakers the quality is excellent and the volume control is substantial and well made not flimsy like most that i have seen a company like koss should know better
i have about 200 live concerts that i burned onto tdk discs about 3 years ago none of them are playable now going forward i will only use mitsui gold cds
i too am experiencing the problems of the original post i purchased the tdk 50 disc spindle i was sent a spindle so far no matter the speed about 5 of 25 have successfully burned using nero i use the much less lauded verbatims i have that are over two years old no problems i do not know what to make of it previous to this purchase i had nothing but glowing reviews for tdk media
this card is nothing more than a multimediacard mmc there are many options out there for purchasing mmc also securedigital sd cards are fully compliant with the palm pilots for which this memory card is being marketed at the time of writing this review this was among the most expensive of comparable cards in fact yesterday at a local retailer i saw a the capacity for five dollars more so my advice is that you do purchase expansion cards to take full advantage of the power of your palm i have purchased many and am able to use my palm as an player using realone a video player using kinoma an atlas using mapopolis and a video game system using palmone sega classic cards and downloaded games all at the same time do buy sd or mmc cards to expand but i would encourage you to comparison shop looking for better prices hantl
well to start off the positive about this product the material its made out of is really durable and i like it it really does protect your nano they were easy to put on and the screen protecters are great but the negative and why i gave this product one star but if i had to give it no stars for being such than i would it doenst fit the nano right it doesnt cover a great portion of the bottom of the nano you really have to fight to get to the hold button part of the cover hangs over on the screen so its hard to see what your looking at and since its too small for the nano the cover also hangs over on your selector which causes it to push the buttons on it so u could be listening to a song and then it shuts off because the cover is pushing the button ! honestly i will be returning this item it is durable to make it thu a year in in iraq but the bottom half of my nano will be ruined ! dont waste your money on this produc
i 'm a tenor who use pc to record my vocal this mic is just slightly better than a my major complaint about it is that it apparently does not have a 'pop ' filter that reduces explosive noise due to proximity and breathing if you 're serious about getting your vocal performance recorded nicely this mic is not for you
i purchased this microphone i am returning it the same day i was looking for a microphone that would work with my pc had a little better quality than the standard ones you get with a new computer sound coming from this was so lo windows could n't even detect a voice being transmitted ca n't complain too much it was less than 10 i have not tried this product with other devices i use my pc for all of my recording
i am very dissapointed with this router it has slowed down my connection speed to a snails pace i downloaded the firmware upgrade and changed the propety settings as suggested by linksys but this router still lags i can not use it to play online games or logon to my company citrix server without experiencing long delays when communcating i have a aircard on my laptop and it has a faster connection speed than this unit ! i had a belkin 4 router that i was using for 3 years and never had problems like this the amount of time i wasted and frustration i have experienced trying to get this unit to work properly doesnt make it a deal at any price they are asking maybe it works ok for basic email or chatrooms but good luck getting it to reliably transfer data at high speed if you rely on your router i give it 1 star because it did connect to the internet
i had an old linksys 8 port router and it was a fairly decent router as it got old it became quirky and i replaced it with a new the was a piece of junk it was unstable and unusable i took it back for a refund how disappointing that the new product is so much worse than the old one
i built a new house and set up a computer network i purchased the linksys router and when i connected it i was only able to get a 56 kps connection the firmware upgrade failed i spent hours on the phone with their support to no avail i hooked my old linksys router up and i got 3350 kps speed to every computer i had connected i returned it to radio shack where i purchased it and they replaced it the new one came and i got the same result linksys asked me to return it to them directly and they would replace it i did and the one i got from them was the worst of all it only got a 33 kps connection the one linksys sent me had no upc code so i was unable to return it and they would not return my calls i wrote to the ceo at linksys and received no reply radio shack finally allowed me to return it for a refund i am disappointed with linksys 's attitude on this matter i decided to use my router with a switch and i received outstanding results to all of my machines without any problems i would not receommend this product or returning anything to linksys get a refund if it does n't work
this was my first player which i bought specifically for listening to while running i carried the player in its holster '' to a reflective waist belt often in a bag after about 15 months of use times each week for minutes each time it simply died blank lcd screen reset button does nothing my pc does n't even detect it anymore now with the conveniently for cowon out of warranty i 'm forced to shop for another player my impression of this device based on the manufacturer 's website and reviews of similar players is that they are designed to be disposable i do n't see myself ever spending over 50.00 for another player if do the 2 year replacement plan would be of benefit
poor quality little buds i just bought them for the rubber earhugger '' piece to be used with other phones
well i totally agree with previous reviewer as far as the quality of this earhugger i have only one thing to say about buy especially if you wear eye glasses like myself using earhugger would be horribly uncomfortable for you i did n't expect best performence when i bought it at its price but i certainly did n't expect it would be that bad ! when a person with a pair of glasses wear the earhugger he or she would n't be able to use it without having to constantly adjust its position around the ear because it does n't stay fixed longer than 5 minutes unless you really like the price i recommend you not to buy this earhugger especially if you wear glasses
they may sound good and look good but look somewhere else for earhuggers aside from being uncomfortable they 're unsteady and in two plastic wraps that easily come loose from your ears as well as the actual earbuds dropping from their holders and apart from all of that the sound quality is horrific you would be best doing a search again and finding a new pair
i dont know about the installation on this thing tryed to install this with the bluetooth card supplied and my new hp pavilion with bluetooth built in you would think it would be easy no way ! ! after two hours on my own then two hours to a guy in india who did not know anything i gave up boxed it up and sent it back its also bigger then you would expect its not something you can put in a brief case with a laptop its way too big your better off bring a cheap lexmark printer with a usb cable
this is the worst fax machine i 've ever had the paper gets jammed and you have to put the pages once at the time the quality of the printed page is really bad
despite being advertised otherwise on sony 's site as well as many vendors this unit is power only it does not come with a battery clip to permit operation with non power devices i purchased and had to return
while the specs above say power supply offers power with selected sony or aiwa portable recorders battery power for use with all other recorders this is not true there is no battery unit shipped with this device you can see it in the instructions but it is n't in the package so unless you are using it with a selected sony or aiwa '' device do n't buy this it wo n't work btw i am a slow learner when i bought the first one of these i thought it was defective because it did n't have the battery pack i returned it and got another one which was absolutely unopened guess what ! there is no battery pack in the blisterpack
i 've been using sony 's for more than 5 years now and have loved it so two weeks ago i ordered the sony to use for audio journal keeping while on the road when it arrived just a few days ago i compared the audio quality of its recordings to that of my existing sony microphone in spite of its pleasing aesthetics i found it to be a sad disappointment ! ! ! the is a very noisy microphone with an audio quality far inferior of what i would expect from a sony mic i wonder whether this is because it is a mic frankly i think i 'm probably going to return it and look for something else i 've purchased a number of microphones on ebay and have only been satisfied with one other type of compact mic microsound makes it and its a mic with a cable lead about three inches long i 'm not in any way affiliated with them but i would recommend their product with all of this said i think i still might spring for sony 's lapel microphone just to see whether it 's any good
i had read other reviews regarding the keys getting stuck i bought for christmas anyway and my son loved it the keys threatened to stick on many occasions and the instrument finally broke on march 7. six of the seven keys on one side only blow air i 'm not sure what to do because he wants another one
i usually never buy any electronics without reading a review first on cnet i had previously bought the harman and kardon home theatre speaker system in a box hkts 14 i loved the system so much as the shelf speakers were great and the sub was incredible well my wife was dusting one day and accidently turned the knob in the back all the way up and to make a long story short the sub was fried it was going to cost to fix it and i only paid like 370 all together for the system so i decided i would try a jbl subwoofer note to people buying subwoofers if there are no meaningful '' reviews on a subwoofer do n't get it it was hard to come by any reviews negative or positive for this subwoofer the few reviews out there were all positive but stated little about the product i bought the sub for about 250.00 or so i have been so very unhappy with it thus far first off it is a direct firing subwoofer unlike the harman kardon which was a down firing the would shake me my walls and my neighbors walls everytime i watched a movie with the jbl i have to stick my hand in front of the subwoofer to make sure it is on one of the reasons i bought this sub is because it boasts a 250 watts rms with 500 watt peak since my was only 200 watts i figured this would be a great step up sorry to say it was a horrible step down i even wrote the technicians at jbl and stated by frustrations to them in so little words they basically told me that the harman and kardon subwoofer i previously owned was better than this one if i had to do it all over again i would have bought the polk audio this was one of the only speakers i was able to listen to at fry 's and absolutely loved was just out of my price range i am now wishing that i would have just saved the money and bought that subwoofer as it would blow this one out of the water with half the volume i predict i will be putting this subwoofer on sale on ebay very soon sorry for the long very frustrated and i told jbl that i would get on every sight that i could to show my displeasure with this subwoofer !
deceptive advertising it should say fhss if you want dsss do n't get this
i purchased the panasonic to replace a 8 year old sony phone the sony would allow me to go about 400 feet from the base before the signal became unusable the new panasonic has a usable range on the order of 60 feet i have a one story 20 year old 3000 sq ft brick home relocating the phone did not help i returned the phone for credit and bought a panasonic which is the same phone but with three color handsets thinking the first unit may have been bad not the case the replacement is just as poor in range all the other features of the phone are good and work as advertised if range is a concern for you you would do well to look at some other system
returned it the phone kept dropping calls from the other side of the house and some times from the next room no reception at all in the yard we used to have an old years old phone that had a really good range could go all over the house and outside even across the street and still get crystal clear reception but that phone was dropped too many times and stopped working however even the replacement i got uniden was not much better as far as range and we are returning that one too so the search for a phone with a good range continues i wish someone would make a simple phone with a decent range i really do not care for all the new bells and whistles such as color screen calendars ring tones etc all i need is a basic phone that wont drop calls from the other side of the house with a speaker on both handset and base keypad on base so i can make calls without the handset and an answering machine with 30 minutes of recording time and decent quality so i can understand the messages left on it long battery life and auto redial phone book is nice but not mandatory
great price but that does n't make a difference if you 're sent the wrong merchandise i received button cells instead of the which are useless to me i tried to get this corrected and decided it is cheaper and less time consuming to just let it go and order elsewhere
the design is perfect for the magellan 's but the suction cup will not adhere to todays car dashes the only place it will stick is to the windows i 'm now in the process of ordering a piece of sheet metal to stick to the dash and then mount it to the metal it is not going to be an easy project because of the weight of the magellan i will not resort to 'screws ' in my dashboard ai n't gon na happen a better idea for dash mount is needed dashboards are rippled plastics or a nonpourus material it just 'wo n't ' work
i attached this antenna to a wireless router to try to expand the range then all of the wired ethernet ports started dropping connectivity and i was getting hardware error '' reports from the network monitor took the antenna off and it all worked fine again you would think would have at least tested this with their own product
i replaced the antenna on my router i am able to extend the antenna ft from the base but i do n't see any signal improvement on my laptop or desktop that's on wifi
the price was okay but the unit was not very good from a mounting standpoint i had to replace it with a ram unit i can not recommed this product
i purchased this mounting kit to quickly attach my gps to my harley davidson for travel the kit is misleading as a mounting kit '' it does hold the unit somewhat securely although i have added extra protection to prevent detachment from the bracket during travel it does not have the hardware needed to attach to the handle bars therefore additional products must be purchased what is called a ram kit '' which is sold at other vendors online is required costs are about 35 to 50 bucks i felt deceived when i purchased it as a mounting kit '' and was unable to initially mount it to my bike
this is just a mounting kit it needs a party cell phone '' mount to actually attach to your motorcycle very disappointed that i have to order something in addition to this kit '' after getting a ram mount from somewhere else i do n't think amazon sells them this did mount easily and quickly to my bike just be aware that you need a ram mount in addition to this kit which is really just a connection from a ram mount to the garmin devic
the cord is too short and the mouse is made of cheap quality plastic making the mouse have a feel in your hand basically the mouse is trying to mimic the old logitech wingman gaming mouse but if you really enjoyed that mouse go for logitech 's latest and greatest gaming mouse the laser gaming mouse and you wo n't be disapointed best buy has them for half off right now at their store and website so i just picked one up
the phone was very annoying everytime i tried to call on the phone it would not connect i would have to either change the channel or just not call i was only able to connect to the number i was calling once in the times i attempted to call i returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone consumers report was very wrong in their rating of this phone the phone was terrible !
this phone is nothing like i thought it was going to be first of all it is so light it feels like a toy when i drop it the whole thing comes apart i tend to drop things a lot so that 's not good for me at all it does n't even have a speaker button on the base like i thought it did it does have one on the handset but that does n't help a whole lot when i click over to answer a second call more than half the time i ca n't get back to my first call i have to hang up and call them back i should have given this phone a 1 star '' rating but i gave it a 2 because i am able to talk on it that 's about the only thing good about it i would have been better off going to the drug store and buying a phone for 10 this phone costs me about 40 and it was not worth it
the phone works but the answering machine does n't it plays the outgoing message but never takes the phone '' the calling party ca n't hear the message or leave a message the phone appears to keep on ringing and i had to pay return shipping costs to boot let 's see if the replacement
i got this to have at our home for our grandson but it came with no remote although the box stated one was included plus it did n't seem to work in our home with our cable service and after calling customer service several times and only getting voice mail felt it might be a sign that this product was a lemon and i 'd better cut my loses and return it ! it may just have been the one that i received but it did n't seem like an american made high quality item again it may only have been one lemon and the rest may all be super i 'm only commenting on my experience so you can weigh your decision to buy or not on that
there is essentially no sound amplification the sound levels are barely different with the thing on as opposed to having it off sort of a what were they thinking '' product
the builtin speakers in my laptop sounded better and louder than these speakers the sony 's highs are muddy and the volume does not go very loud yes my laptop volume was all the way up if you want extra laptop speakers for your presentations with clients look elsewhere all we wanted was a decent quality sound that was a little louder than our laptop speakers and these speakers definitely did not deliver and will be returned if you need ultra portable sound and your laptop speakers are broken or sound much worse than average laptops we have nothing special then maybe this would work for you
i am an instructor i needed a speaker system with a very small profile for international air travel a friend of mine who works for a major computer company recommended these due to their size though he did warn me the sound quality is average the speakers are indeed small light and they conveniently fit into my computer bag the sound is average as i was warned the ubs connection cable is too short which is an inconvenience but most disturbingly the third time i used these they stopped working properly unfortunately it was past my warranty period their malfunction may have been a coincidence but under the circumstances i can not recommend these even when they did work the sound was n't do yourself a favor look for an alternate model there are many choices out there in prices that range from 30 80 just remember to go with a model usb power is a must !
i bought this router and since day one i had problems in accessing the configurations through the web utility linksys support 's suggestions did n't work i researched the problem and noticed that a lot of other people were having issues in accessing the router configurations through the web utilitiy i problably had a faulty router to begin with anyhow i send it back for a refund
these headphones were great at first but then failed right ear stopped working after 3 months i sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months stay away from these
i have both a chevrolet gm pickup and a jeep chrysler and specifically purchased the unit to clean the laser lens in the jeep it will not operate in the chrysler corporation cd player as it immediately displays an error '' message and ejects the maxell lens cleaner disk it does function in the gm player however i have noticed that the chrysler cd player is 'finiky ' about playing some cd disks that always play on the gm unit it is obvious that my gm unit is superior to my chrysler unit but the fact remains the maxell disk will not function in my jeep 's cd player
i bought this product because i 'm impressed with the feature it has and as a customer support engineer i need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to carry on the street most of the time i carry it as a backpack but it 's not tough as it should be it last only 1 month and the inner side between the padded computer compartment began to tear because it has a lifetime warranty i went back to the shop and got a new one after a month plus the inner side i will say it as a weakness starting to tear again and then i will go back to the shop to replace it
i purchased this item less than a week ago from a local retail chain it did not occur to me until after i got it home that my mac would not work with it my husband told me that there was no way that it would work properly if at all with our computer so luckily he felt sorry for me and took it back to the store SMILE to my suprise and delight he returned home with an ipod i am so much happier with this one besides next to the ipod the zen looks too much like a toy for my five year old daughter so if you have a mac or a really mean husband do n't get the zen
it 's a shame that garmin wo n't allow you to buy the individual components in case something gets lost i had to buy the whole mount just because i needed the rod connecting the base to the nuvi 'holder ' for the portable friction mount
this thing worked fine for about nine months and then died it does n't like humidity i keep my switch and router in my basement like many basements it 's a bit damp though i have a dehumidifier running all the time it 's not that damp in there but the switch just died on me i 'd question the power supply or some other factor but my router and dsl modem have never had any problems at all and this is the second netgear switch i 've owned that has gone kaput my best guess is dampness
beware the connectors are very fragile even a small amount of tug applied to the connectors will pull it right off the cable for the amount of money i spent on the monster video cable they should have been stronger i picked a cheap length of cable at my local hardware store and the connectors were virtually indestructable monster cable should manufacture a more robust product
as a sysadmin i am administering windows linux and mac pcs all day and need this device to go between them all seamlessly pros lots of room for data after much headache i uninstalled and the drive now works on all platforms cons the caused trouble from the start confuses linux machines i was n't expecting to work of course but it is supposed to appear just like a data drive on pcs instead it just failed failed to work on a mac failed to work on vmware windows images failed to work on windows pcs where the pc has some policies that prevent full access to the pc most environments other cons are that it does n't fit well onto my keychain it comes with an extremely flimsy cord to attach it to things so flimsy it was immediately obvious that it would break on a keychain with the way keys get used throughout the day so i ditched the cord and fished the keychain loop through the actual plastic hole on the end of the key but it 's too small to allow for free movement so it is always tangling up my keychain the lid appears to be getting looser the more i use it too has the uninstaller product it works fine and now the drive acts just like a plain data drive i recently bought 20 of these for distribution at work we unpack them and immediately remove before handing them out it would be a support nightmare otherwise my advice is to buy a drive without or similar technology while you still can
there is very very little you can do on the platform that ca n't be accomplished on an ordinary usb drive platform even if you are in the very small minority that needs to boot from a portable device it 's important to keep in mind that a applications are highly overpriced b extremely limited in number and c limited to cheesy programs of dubious value such as password databases form fillers ad nauseum i mean what idiot would buy a 100 device plus a 25 application all in the hopes of managing passwords
if you are looking for an ipod case just to protect your ipod against scratches and such this is n't a bad case however the screen protector it comes with is n't ideal it does n't stick on to the screen well in addition the extras the skin comes with are useless the armband is pretty weak and by that i do n't mean that it does n't fit snuggly around the arm but rather that it does n't hold the ipod sturdily when you move your arm the ipod will rock i think the reason is because of the way this case was designed rather than attach a piece on the back of the skin through which you could slide the armband they cut two slits in the back of the case and because the skin is made of a thin piece of flimsy rubber the ipod rocks away as you if you are looking both for a good case and something you could use for out consider spending a few more bucks and buying the incase sleeve it comes with an armband a belt clip and a handband to wrap around your hand when running if you like holding the ipod instead that case is sturdy and much more useful
my mom bought this particular portable player for my son because we were going to be on some long flights and she thought he 'd handle it better if he could watch a few dvds the picture and audio quality are n't that great but not bad for the price the only problem is that we can not get the rechargeable battery to charge therefore it is useless for the purpose it was bought for it still places if plugged into an electrical outlet but there is no way to take it on the plane i have not been able to find a replacement battery but am assuming it might be less expensive to buy a whole new dvd player
bought one of these at sears and was initially happy with it but after a couple weeks of light use the battery refused to charge so i exchanged it at the store for a new unit used that one again gently and according to the manual for about a week then it ceased working altogether the player would n't turn on whether on battery or mains power audiovox clearly has either design or quality control problems with this model i suggest selecting a different model and perhaps a different brand
i initially bought this because it had a 5 star rating at the time though few had rated it it worked great for a short while then it broke after 4 months of use this is shameful because we probably only used it for about 15 hours of portable viewing we took very good care of it and the screen simply went out while we were watching it we still use the dvd player in our bedroom but the portable aspect is totally gone the screen is no longer functioning do n't buy this there are hopefully better ones out there we just placed an order on a new one let 's hope we have better luck
i have had to replace my audiovox dvd player twice ! the first time was because the sensor was not reading the dvd the second was because the rechargeable battery would not charge and now audiovox is telling me that to buy a new battery will cost 79.00 plus shipping and handling this cost is the cost i paid for the audiovox and of course they audiovox will not offer any discount or compensation for their sad '' product and the is horrible with earphones ! sometimes it 's worth to pay for a quality name brand product that has value
we purchased our dvd player in june 2005 from hh gregg for 140 by december the screen would sometimes turn white so that we could n't see the picture within a few months the screen stayed white all of the time so that now we can not play dvds at all audiovox wants 94 to fix it i 'm sure thats the cost of replacing it the sound quality was never great but we endured it what a complete waste of money and theres no way i 'm sending audiovox another 100 for this or any other product
we used these radios on a corvette road tour to the national convention in san antonio had no problems great response batteries appear to last more than a few days
i bought these radio 's as an upgrade to the cobra frs only that i had before the range did improve i have had as much as miles car to car on the freeway but the audio is poor i normally place the radio in the center console and listen to the conversations from the caravan that i 'm in the cobra was very good at this but even with full volume the motorola needs to be held close to my ear and the audio quality is poor i have used other people 's older model frs only motorola 's in the past and they were superior to my cobra 's these are not in the same league the quality is poor enough that i 'm again looking for radio 's
despite the description of '' vcr this unit does not have a tuner this means you must have an external signal source if you wish to record tv programs you can not connect it directly to your basic cable service if that 's not a problem for you then this may be an ok unit but you can only watch tv thru it by having an external vcr cable box or other unit capable of tuning a tv signal
this product does not have its own tuner which is not mentioned on sony 's webpage nor in any specifications of the product it is revealed '' unhappily after purchase if one has a surround system this product is incompatible trying to get sony representatives to confirm this disadvantage was enormously frustrating
although i have not had the need to use the warranty the vendor was asked on 3 different occassions to send the contract this was also noted in another review that i read
fist off i do not own this product but i have researched it i just called the customer service number listed for this product and talked to a csr i asked her if this plan will cover replacing the lamp in a dlp tv i will be buying this weekend she looked up the answer and read off a statement '' i apologize for the inconvenience of your lamp burning out sir but the lamp unit is not be covered under our service plan as that is an accessory which requires scheduled replacement '' it also seems like this is not a warranty extension as it starts the moment you purchase the plan not the moment the manufacturer 's standard warranty ends my first job after high school was in an electronics store selling tvs stereos and appliances as well as the extended warranties that are offered at those types of places sometimes they are worth it if they replace a common unit which tends to fail on a normal basis this plan does not cover the unit which is sure to fail on you within the first years and is concurrent with the manufacturer 's warranty and is therefor not very attractive so there you have it
i have never received any correspondence from this company they were supposed to send the service plan within weeks after i received the television however as i stated i never received the plan !
i purchased this item to power a passive i own prior to buying it i described what i was hoping to accomplish to the manufacturer and was told this was the perfect match it was n't i 'm guessing that this amp is really good for something but for me it has proven to be a paperweight
i purchased a white one of these for the holidays less than 6 months later the connector for docking the ipod broke off from the circuit board unfixable really a bad design and very cheap wasted my money with this device in addition the clock radio features a gradual volume increase when the radio goes off at the set time not a bad idea except you ca n't turn off the feature and the volume starts loud and gets so loud so quickly that it will wake the entire house up the worse part is this is the only way for you to use the wake to feature why you ca n't preset a constant volume when setting the wake time is clearly another bad design i would not recommend !
for the money it is okay but sems to need constant adjustment would set it for a channel then come bak later in the day and needed to adjust again
they do n't look as nice as the photo they look rather cheesy retraction mechanism works reasonably well if you 're careful with it sound quality is average i 'm keeping mine as a backup set only
in less than 1 year the scroll wheel starting sticking which means that when you want to use it for scrolling the computer recognizes it as if you are pushing down the scroll wheel the length of the wire is about inches shorter than it should be
i have had two of these both of them do not work the first one lasted for about half a year then broke the one broke the second i brought it home it was still intact but did not work at all look instead for something from logitec
wish i had bought this from amazon i paid 20 more for it at staples this pack is cushiony great looking with lots of pockets but beware the zippers are very prone to breaking we ended up cutting through two of the zippers after they broke to get the objects inside this was after only 4 months of use also the backpack is quite heavy i would n't buy this again at the steep price it is it definitely is n't worth the money
i used the for a couple of days before returning it i had to reboot the router every day to connectivity to the internet additionally if i disconnected my ethernet cable on any of my pcs the print server app would continually try to for the printer server causing the pc to bog down and be really slow do not buy one of these the is far superior
i upgraded my home net with several pieces of netgear hardware including the router the wifi access point and the an switch with 4 power over ethernet poe ports the ap and the poe switch have been excellent choices not so with the router although it has features you do n't find in a lot of consumer routers like stateful packet inspection spi logging and email alerts it just kept dropping connections to my home pcs for no apparent reason that i could find and no support from netgear the dhcp server would seem to die and all my home pcs would then lose their ips and revert to private ips at that point my only recourse was to restart the router after three weeks of this nonsense i said to with it i 'm sending it back the router i 'm interested in now is the smc barricade plus
unfortunately i never got to use it as the ipod would not charge looked very cute but never got to use it returning for a
i use this type of flash drive for my research and more than half the time i can never view the images on the computer or get the flash drive to work worth buyin
i bought this drive only a few hours ago saved very important documents to it and all of a sudden it does n't want to open on me it states that the drive needs to be reformatted doing this would cause me to lose all of my data terrible i warn you not to buy this product not worth it
i purchased this months back and am happy with it for most part did n't have any formatting problems as some of the others but the key hole is fragile and broke off you can probably buy this thing but be extra nice and careful with the cap and be careful if you have memorex rebates they ate away a 20 which was offered with the purchase i called the customer service multiple times and each time they made it harder to get the rebate i ultimately gave up and feel cheated
i am not a tech person but i am also not completely useless i have three cards i use for my palm pilot and two digital cameras i have been very unhappy with this product the other two cards are not pny this card seems to work fine in the camera and palm pilot but will not work when i plug it into the sd slot in either of our laptops it just locks up the computers for a while then asks if the card should be formated clicking yes '' or no '' does not help i get a message that it can not be formated i am sure it is the card since the same thing happens on different computers like another reviewer i unfortunately threw the packaging away because it appeared to work in the camera i even tried to have the camera format it it just ca n't be read by the computers none of the other cards have this problem i ca n't return it and it certainly is n't working properly i would recommend buying a different brand
the previous post is correct about it being only a 1 gig sd card total bs
i bought this sd card from j r music last week i thought i would get the authentic card from pny so i just used the card with my camera and threw the package away a couple days later i took the card out to put all the picture in my pc and realized by that time the card is only i contacted the customer service department and they said they wo n't deal with me unless i have the original package which i do n't anymore they adviced me to contact the pny store so i did a little research and found that the exact same card is from toshiba model and j r or whoever their suppliers are just put a pny label on it to sell it as a pny if you do n't believe me just type toshiba on google and the picture is exactly the same except for the little lable i really do n't care if the card is made by toshiba or pny as long as it is but it is n't and that would make it really tough to recover your loss from any party pny toshiba or j r i already contacted my credit card company for a dispute little advice for everyone stay away from this particular card and j r store and also check the card validity with your computer as soon as you get the item
these cases are but fragile if you drop one it 's trashed my main complaint is that only 40 of them are useable i bought mine at bestbuy when i got them home i opened the package and found most of the cases were missing the little plastic to return them but bestbuy accused me of breaking them i went into the store and inspected the other packages those too had most of the hinges missing go ahead buy 'em if you want to you 'll just end up throwing most of them away
they are now making me rich ! how i just made a bet with trevor a friend of a friend and owner of this bose companion 5 system that i could find a better 2.1 system of computer speakers for the same price which would knock his socks off in a blind listening test ! that means we bring in a person who would switch the sound between his bose system and a system of my choice with him wearing a blindfold and choosing which system he preferred without knowing what he was listening to the loser would have to pay the winner a cool four plus shipping and tax so i brought over a pair of cambridge soundworks ensemble 208 speakers with matching sub which i had ordered online just for this test 's how confident i was about it trevor and i chose 3 cds each for the test and cynthia our company 's secretary was the switcher person norah jones ' come away with me '' miles davis ' kind of blue '' and vivaldi 's four seasons '' were my cds while jeff used 's achtung baby '' eminem 's slim shady lp '' and bob dylan 's highway 61 revisited '' the result it was n't even close he chose the cse in 30 out of the 35 blind tests cynthia put us through ! poor trevor he was so flabberghasted that he just did n't know what to say when she announced the final tally next i had him listen to both systems without the blindfold and then the words came pouring out of him ! to wit oh my god i hate you so much ! i was so in love with my bose and now i 'm so ashamed of them ! '' yep it really was no contest in every musical genre jazz rock blues classical in every aspect of sound presentation imaging soundstage detail texture emotional involvement and in every part of the musical frequency range bass treble the bose were simply put to shame it was like comparing a moped to a motorcycle just two completely different animals ! trevor who confessed to having owned nothing but shelf stereo systems his whole life fisher akai sony sound familiar was amazed at just how good music could really sound with the proper gear and actually thanked me for opening his eyes just in time he still had another week left on his return policy for this bose system thank god i told him that he might 've lost four hundred bucks but gained a lifetime of truly good since he was thinking about blowing over two grand on some bose home theater setup to soften the blow i promised him that i 'd help him spend just over a thousand bucks for a far better home theater setup svs subwoofers dot com and hsu research dot com so in the end he 'll actually come out at least six hundred bucks ahead ! so while this bose system really deserves one star i 'll give it 2 stars this time for the extra dough it 's just earned me hip hip hooray
these speakers do not work with the laptop i have more specifically a dell latitude with docking station it works with the just the laptop but not through the docking station ! ! ! ! ! ! so i dont know what they sound like yet beware that they have bugs ! ! !
first a little about myself as a listener i 'm no audiophile so i do n't put any stock in the reviews from bose bashers '' or the claimed audiophiles '' i know what i like when i hear it i have the acoustimass 6 system attached to my home theater and i love it the size makes it unobtrusive when the object is to watch a movie and the sound is really great for my den i have the polk speakers attached to some high dollar gear and the sound is awesome i 've skimped on my computer speakers because i did n't see a use for high quality sound coming from the noisy box under my desk but i 'd hoped to change that with a nice set of bose speakers that were unobtrusive like my home theater i have a logitech 5.1 thx system that sounded decent and it sounded better than these speakers at of the price since i moved my computer room to the attic i can no longer mount the logitech speakers due to the of this room so i needed a 2.1 system as for the companion 5 system the quality of the components is very good i like the control pod and the setup was fast and easy however immediately apparent with the companion 5 speakers is the thin tinny sound coming from the satellites it sounded like i was listening to my computer through a phone line unlike the acoutimass 6 system i was very aware of the fact that all of the base was coming from the subwoofer and i was equally aware of the location of the base module i checked the documentation for correct placement and was discouraged to find out that i had indeed placed the speakers correctly still i moved things around and around and fiddled with the settings and moved things around until i found a placement that delivered acceptable though not really good sound quality i had to place the subwoofer directly behind my monitor with the satellites right next to the monitor to get a sound that would keep me from returning the system i 'm not thrilled with the bose speakers and i 'll go back to my logitech system if i relocate my desk again i wish i had a recommendation for a nice 2.1 system but i would n't recommend the companion 5 system to anyone looking for a good sound from a set of computer speakers
picked these up last night and they really sound bad there seems to be a lot of artifacts in the sound from the digital signal processing also they recommend you not separate the speakers by more than 24 '' that 's hard with a large monitor the quality of materials is top notch though i expected allot better sound quality from bose especially considering the price listening to one of my favorite cds for about five minutes over them actually made me nauseous i returned them to the store this morning for a full refund
i was extremely disappointed in this purchase it turned out to be a refurbished model that did not work ! there was no indication beforehand that it was not a brand new item i had to pay ups to send it back then i only received a partial refund for the returned item it cost me a bundle to learn not to buy anything from amazon again
try doing something other than copying or scanning both work quite well actually and you are in for a terrible time the settings are simplistic high print quality standard '' oooo decisions decisions do n't try to print anything with vivid colors ! you will get terrible results couple that with the in package software 's inability to create photos that are centered and you have one poor printer i do n't know why they stopped making the ip 90. why mess with perfection do n't get me wrong the scanner and copier and fax are great if this is what you wish to do with this device as far as photo printing goes there are far better on the market for a far cheaper price
based on reviews reviews and reviews by ilounge i decided to get the versus the iflip the reviews i had seen were fairly accurate but i think the reviewers were too enamored with style over function the is very well built it 's solid ipod integration is very nice and there is excellent fit and finish the speakers provide pretty good sound and make a good portable system for use on the road in fact the reviews used this as one of the real descriminators but when am i going to use this without headphones for me at least a better sounding audio system is n't as important on a device like this additionally the importance of an ir remote is for a personal device at least for my personal use profile in airplanes and other vehicles all else being the same these would have been selling points for the however all else is not equal there are two flaws which are driving me to return the product 1 no aspect ratio selection now many posters at ilounge had discussed this issue and recent posts claimed this problem was fixed with a menu selection but the unit i bought on dec 30 2006 does not allow selection of i sent multiple messages to si and received a response from nick stating that there was not a firmware fix available for the unit that leaves only a few possible conclusions a there is no fix and the few posts of a fix are 'planted' b there is a fix in new units but the vendor is unwilling to offer a firmware upgrade c there is a fix and there is no way to upgrade the unit 's firmware c is the most likely scenario but in any case it 's a deal breaker to me watching downloaded video in ' mode is simply not acceptable for a product in this price category i do n't mind my dvds with the proper wide screen aspect ratio but there is no way to play native video without video stretching 2 the battery does n't provide power to the ipod the ipod battery drains as the system is being used the cheaper competition keeps the ipod battery topped off so when the video system drains you still have a fully charged ipod for your portable use also if your ipod battery is drained you can not use the again not so with the cheaper competing product i 'll do my by repeating the is a very well built product it 's look and feel is very nice and if i did n't have to contend with issue 1 i would probably live with issue 2. however there appears to be no way to assure you 'll get a unit with the firmware upgrade if it exists i can not recommend the
i got these for my wife who listens to am radio on her portable sony radio while commuting on the bus and train 5 days a week she would run through a ton of regular alkaline aaa batteries so rechargeables made sense she has a pair of the energizer 's and a pair of duracell 's that are of the same capacity and she says that the energizer 's are terrible and hardly hold a charge we use a maha charger which charges each battery independently so they do n't get overcharged what else can you say about rechargeables either they last long or they do n't these energizer 's do not we recently got a pair of sony aaa 's and they seem to be even better than the duracell's
although description does not mention tv tunning the image is misleading since it shows tv '' besides am and fm future buyers should know what you see is not what you get i will have to buy another unit with tv tunning for the gym
the ear phones broke the first week i purchased the device do n't waste your money
out of the box one of the two radios is not sending nor receiving everything else is working but it does not pick up a signal like if you are on a different channel i sent them back to amazon
we purchased two of these multifunction machines for two separate offices while the brother has many capabilities including file and pdf quality problems greatly hender its performance scanning documents through the document feeder result in images i thought we simply purchased a but after returning it for a replacement we got the same result the first unit we purchased broken down after about 2 months it just started making this really loud clunking sound then it just complained with error messages and would n't print there was a problem with the included software which caused scans to fail with error code the only way to get a fix for this problem is to call technical support there is no information on the error on their web site i love the feature set of this product but the quality is poor
i was with hp for years needed mfp read all reviews here and decided that will be a good choice other option was hp 3055 it has everything i need copier network print scan fax easy setup i am in it for years everything was almost perfect the only complaint you need to keep in mind it eats 1100 watts when starts printing light could flash it was ok until i reached 1500 pages mark it start printing small dots every '' no problem need to clean everything per my experience and confirmed on brother 's web site cleaned it was the biggest mistake all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page called support 2 times after few hours of troubleshooting they advised me to replace drum hey its only 1500 pages nowhere close to promised 25000 ! after i mentioned it they offered me 75 discount on it what 's about warranty sorry i spoke to supervisor he explained that support in philippines ca n't do it the only option to call usa office i replaced drum now counter shows around 2000 pages and i have same problem again hey i heard this before never say never still as of today i would never never buy brother again ! ! !
this was advertised on the web site and on an sent to me by amazon that this unit will work with the explorist 300. this explorist has has no ports for anything to plug into it because this was purchased from a authorized amazon company i could not return without a big hastle sorry this is not for the product
the cord works just fine but by the time you get the usb cord and the cord together there is a lot of cord it would make more sense to have a cigarette adapter that pluged into the back of the unit the same way the usb cord does that way there is n't a bunch of cord attached to the unit
i bought 2 of one for me and another for my fiancee it looked pretty good deal when the product arrived i was so dissapointed that i decided to return them immediately the looks and feel is very cheap the sleeves does n't seem to be of nice quality it feels like they may get torn or come out of its place any time i then looked for case logic made of koshin they are pretty good another good one is slappa they have hard case like structure i got them at pretty low price at may also find good ones at with coupons and stuff i love amazon they took it back without any fuss i would n't recommend this item
i got this for my husband for christmas and it still is n't working he wanted it to listen to baseball games on the xm in our bedroom well he 's made every attempt to put the antenna in the right area outside of our house and we still ca n't get any reception he finally had to order another 50 antenna from xm hopefully this will make it work
it makes a low humming noise if you listen loud enough you wo n't hear it but at low volume it 's annoying also when it is off '' then you still hear the hum
consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing as a person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp expect these to fail within years expect to pay approx 400 to replace the color wheel and 200 to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx 250 depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off '' wait 15 minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung can not even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for 18 months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time ! i have a 42 '' samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 '' crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every 2 years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months ! i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap
notwithstanding attractive reviews elsewhere our office experience with the canon faxphone is that incoming faxes cause the machine to jam if we were doing it again we 'd elect another brand
i 've had this radio for a year good retro looking good sound but all those people who call it 's reception excellent must be on something the fm reception is only ok and the am is just not working it 's not whether the signal is strong or weak it does n't matter the engineering of this part of model one is thoroughly screwed
even though this network card works amazingly well when everything is configured properly and it 's a great bargain belkin is doing everything within its power to make you buy the n card and router instead the day the belkin n router was introduced at my local staples and bestbuy stores last year the cards and router mysteriously disappeared from the shelves and no one could explain why now vista has been out for months yet belkin is still to deliver vista compatible drivers for most of the older cards all you get is a coming soon '' note on their web site with the implied message that they hope you run out of patience with your old useless network card and upgrade to n
i was disappointed to learn this card wo n't work with windows vista i bought the router card together in hopes of getting broader coverage even though it is n't fully '' i contacted support about the issue and they sent me instructions that did n't work out might be a good product for windowsxp but for my purposes i rate it 1 star
1. be careful will try to trick you into separately purchasing this item when in fact it 's already included in the ti calculator packages 2. if you were expecting to download programs from your calculator to your pc with this device like you used to do with graph link forget it ! !
it took me days to get this thing to work with my notebook can not get it to work with my desktop tech support was no help at all they just had me retrying things i already did if your not a networking wizard do not buy this router newer models do n't need the manual setup of this one
the speed is extremely slow and the effective distance is whithin 1 room have to return disappointed
for the price 80 i expected much better sound should spend a little more and get a shoenhut or for 10 you could get a toy piano that sounds better than this one very tinny sound completely out of tune why do they bother even assigning a note to the keys and lid is attached with screws and glue so the only way to get to the metal rods to attempt to tune it even after the screws are removed will be to crack the wood casing getting past the glue
i bought this for my for christmas i actually thought that i was ordering a schoenhut baby grand but for some reason i ended up with this anyway it is not a piano it is a toy it does n't sound like a piano it does n't play like a piano it just looks like one and that is about it metal rods for the sound does n't sound good at all you hit one key and get multiple notes with very little clarity and i have to pound on some of the keys to get it to work well or have a clear sound all in all i really wish i could return this item get my money back and spend the another dollars on a schoenhut or other good brand of childrens piano but the day i received it and checked to see if i could return it i could not i got ripped off by something else people this technically is n't even a string instrument and definatley wo n't really help in teaching a child music in my opinion
my 2 year old son got this for christmas last year and was initially very excited because he loves music however the piano has a very tinny sound and does n't even come close to a real piano sound also the stool and piano legs have to be tightened often and can come off quite easily
nowhere in the description does it mention the ma rating of these batteries i bought them thinking i was going to receive the most current sanyo offering to my sad surprise i ened up with the older version my research indicated that sanyo makes the very best aaa rechargeable battery today just be sure to get the newer version not these
you get what you pay for it 's cheap in price and extremely cheap in quality it only recieves the strongest stations in a building the reception goes almost all static unless your next to a window i finally got rid of mine and bought a pricier pocket radio with better reception
i bought 3 of those to present to someone as a gift but i am really disappointed with this item not clear reception with too much of static do not waste yoour money in this item
you have to move the dial really really slowly to pick up any stations plus the connection with the headphones does n't work so most of the time if you can get a station you ca n't hear it anyway i 'm just going to throw it out and keep the headphones as an extra set
what has happened to monster 's quality in i had a discount on monster cable through my employer and purchased close to 1000 retail prices worth of their cables for wiring up my home theater i have been using the gamelink with for my and that works great here it is 3 years later and i buy these gamelink 400 for use with my new hdtv with component inputs when i tried to install them i thought i was going to snap the connections off my tv because of the amount of force i had to exert with much determination i got them to connect i switched on the and experienced no video just sound i had even a harder time removing them when comparing these cables to my older gamelinks the differences are the new wires are lighter rigid and the connectors are definately too small in diameter in hand they feel cheaper compared to the heavier more pliable older wires i will no longer buy monster cables and i do not recommend these to anyone audioquest is much better too bad they do n't make gaming cables
i own a bose center channel i would say that it is a good speaker for certain applications you will find worst and your will find better a few thoughts 1 many indicate that the speaker will sound better by adjusting your receiver true and that holds true for any speaker 2 it is a slim design true at the same time you can find a few others that are just as small or smaller i would say that it is a matter of personal preference of style what i find is that the bose works out great with my old sony 36 '' wega from 5 years ago about the right size but switching to a 55 '' widescreen it does n't look right and not integrated the best advice i can give is to go listen to the speaker for yourself and inspect the construction and how does it fit in your entertainment center compare to other speakers for sound and appearance the biggest advice is in a home theatre make sure to get an excellent center channel that is where most of the action is and which will make a difference bose is good but i have moved on
consumer reports placed these at the bottom of the list of one of their recent center channel speaker comparisons and i could not agree more lower costing speakers performed far better in some calculated tests of my own i found these had far less range and presence '' than other major brand speakers i have a yamaha speaker that provides full lifelike sound and handles plenty of power this bose center channel speaker was a major disappointment and far from representative of their generally outstanding audio components
i do n't recommend you to buy this item its sound is poor and there is a static noise when the car engine is on
i got what i paid for allows for four frequency options at the top of the dial all of which were picking up real broadcast signals in my area
although very convenient the reception was not good and the device broke after a couple of weeks i would not recommend it
i tought it would be a good deal since the price is really low but not too low but it really works it only has 6 or so stations to choose from and in all of them the interference is louder than the music i recomend this product at all if at least it worked as a car charger
this item is no good and expensive shipping handling charged by the vendor should have gone for something better
i was somewhat skeptic at the low price i was disappointed at the performance of this product to say the least the transmitter only works with the highest frequencies on the fm dial and really bad when it does work
i had my unit for 1 month before experiencing the '' many people have seen i calling their repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 months and it seems that none of the parts that panasonic sent them could fix the unit to this date i still ca n't get panasonic to send me a refurbished unit on top of that i had to drive the unit 97 miles to the nearest repair shop i would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it comes to servicing the warranty
this unit has great sound and is well worth the price i had no issues setting it up or programming it connected to all my devices with no issue
beware of this product ! as soon as i put the system together and tried to put in a dvd the display showed '' and the player would not close apparently my problem is far from unique according to a internet search on '' many people have experienced the this error code with their panasonic home theater units and other panasonic produsts which indicates a faulty or shorted out power supply every time the unit powers on i get the error message sometimes the problem takes a year to show up so i guess i am lucky that my system was broken from the least i can return it check them out for yourselves with the better business bureau panasonic has an unsatisfactory '' rating based on excessive unresolved product quality and repair complaints from what i 've read so far panasonic is not helpful in trying to resolve this i returned my system to amazon and will be purchasing a different brand
before buying this product you absolutely have to go on the web site and try to find out if they support your printer their web site is absolutely atrocious it is so slow and constantly refreshes so it is almost useless they have a link on the back of the box to a list of compatible printers so go directly to it i have an hp officejet printer and the setup did not work at all the tech support was useless they kept trying to ask me what brand of computers i had on the network and what my isp was none of this mattered except to the marketing department it drove me nuts after 5 phone calls i finally got hold of a technical support person that confirmed my printer was not compatible separately even if you have a compatible printer you should be aware of a serious bug in the software if you use 128 bit wep security for your wireless network like we do unless your network uses key 1 of 4 you can not hook the print server into your wireless network there are radio buttons to support the other keys but they do not work tech support acknowledged the issue all in all a horrible experience it 's a shame because their wireless routers are almost decent
after spending hours trying to get this to print and searching their support site i finally did a search on their forums for my printer it turns out this server is incompatible with the hp color laserjet 3500 and 3600 series i had everything else working fine and managed to borrow a friends printer to prove it worked before you buy this server go to their support forums and do a search for your printer and see if there are any issues with it there is no list of compatible printers anywhere because there are only a handful that wo n't work with it
i have talked numerous times with support center from india and philippines they were all trying to help however they do not know what causes the print server behaves that way every time i tried to print it requires to unplug the power code to the print server after printing i try to ping the device the system does not recognize the ip anymore i have returned the item for the second time and no reponse regarding refund of my purchase the support from remote help center for product and support from amazon for customers seem to be equipped just for trival issues
this adapter seems pretty cheaply made no matter which stereo i use it with the music only comes out of the right speaker so music with a lot of panning sounds pretty bad i 'd go with a pricier model next time
i could n't get this cassette adapter to work in my car upon investigation i found that the tape reel sticks and does n't spin i opened the cassette adapter up it 's screwed together and found that the gears do not line up very well needless to say i returned this cassette adapter to amazon i was pleased to see that amazon paid for return postage on this defective product i will be buying another cassette adapter from a local store maybe radio shack so that i can more easily return the item if it does n't work it seems that a lot of these cassette adapters have flaws in them and the more expensive models are not always better good luck
it squeeks loud ca n't listen to the cd because the cassette adapter squeeks to lou
my wife purchased this cordless phone set for me as a christams present since putting it in operation over two months ago i have had nothing that comes close to quality phone service none of the three handset will operate ten feet beyond the base station all the handsets have static and a constant buzzing sound regardless of where they are relative to the base station i followed every point in the owner 's manual regarding trouble shooting with no success my calls to uniden customer service took more than 15 minutes to reach a representative the end result was that the last of the customer service representative i spoke with told me that the uniden phone i was using was a high quality product but that the frequency just does n't work in your environment '' i live well out in the country and know of nothing that would interfer with cordless phone operation within miles of my house moreover a radio shack cordless phone that i purchased five years ago works perfectly throughout my house i am out the purchase price but uniden has lost a customer
my sister bought this for me for xmas i 'm not crazy about them there okay but you ca n't talk on both at the same time which stinks for my kids talking to grandma they do have alot of static and the range if you can say they have any is horriable i can go farther with my older cordless phone these i ca n't even walk outside my old phone i can go anywhere outside and it works great i would not recommand these phones you can get better phones for the same price or less keep looking
i have gone through three over tried different stores and made sure the box was factory fresh the issues listed are the same for all three 1. extremely poor voice quality 2. low volume 3. people on other end of line complain of excessive loudness so the speaker stinks but the mic is good 4. callerid does n't allow me to simply hit talk after receiving a call so i if get a call from someone and i scroll through the list of numbers it does not dial correctly cause it doesnt ' add the 1. i ca n't figure out how to add the one through the menu the phone is junk and will be regifted to someone i hate
got this as an present seems my mil thought that our current uniden took to long to sound the message tone 30 seconds after the machine message finishes was bad ! so she got us this one well after 8 days the phone would no longer connect to the phone line the screen flashes connecting '' for about 10 seconds then displays unable to connect '' tried different hand sets on the base same result ! tried different cables still the same ! so i plugged the uniden back in and all is well except the lag time on the recorder what the hell i like this one it displays the time and is a clear as a bell when talking
i made the mistake of purchasing the 4 handset version of this product before looking at any reviews i thought uniden produced quality products but man was i wrong first of all 20 hours to charge seems like a very long time second only one handset can be used at a time so my wife and i ca n't talk simultaneously to someone on the other end disappointing especially during the holidays when we are trying to talk with our families third calls must be transferred from one handset to another handset for use so if i answer a call for my wife i need to know the handset number of the phone she is going to use before she can pick up unfortunately there is no way to know what handset she has unless its plugged in to its charger making the remote feature of this phone useless keeping track of four interchangeable units is a tall task unless i write the handset number on each phone with a sharpie i have n't had any problems with static as reported below but i never took the remote far from the base unit at least the phone has a call timer so i could track the 23 minutes and 47 secs uniden 's customer service took to answer my call anyway this poorly designed and engineered product is already back in its packaging heading back to where it came
initially i liked and enjoyed the adapter it allowed me to us a digital card to listen to music in the car however it no longer works and i will be exchanging it
it 's true what has already been said the sounds in these headphones is better than expected but i thought the above reviews the other important feature of earbugs these are without a doubt the most uncomfortable headphones i 've ever used they 're cheap but any price is too much jvc should know better than to think a clever name and different colors means they do n't have to worry about comfort
requires installation of bloated software on every windows machine you want to transfer files too only works with a windows machine from the manual of which i could n't copy and paste from because it is copy protected '' a note states tracks that have been digitally recorded on a device and then imported to sonicstage can not be written to audio cd '' so if you hook up a digital mixer to the md to record your band you are out of luck transfers to and from the computer often fail and corrupt your file the manual states tracks that have been recorded on a walkman can be imported to sonicstage only once '' so you 're out of luck if there is a power outage while transferring that recording of your band 's greatest live performance from the manual tracks transferred to the the md from another computer can not be transferred back to my library on your computer '' so god forbid if you actually use more then one computer to manage your the audio you record with this device
the sonicstage is really a disaster i have been using for a year and i use it for recording music lessons when i upload my files to computer to back them up i alway have some recordings about 15 unreadable by sonicstage even though i can listen to them with the minidv what can i do with those recordings i can only leave them in the md walkman if my is broken i have to buy another one in order to listen to those recordings obviously i will never buy sony 's recorder again
i am rating this unit one star due to an problem i am experiencing with the unit after a year of very light use the unit lost 1200 pixels stuck '' on purple all the time manufacturing problems can occur to an otherwise good product but the true test of a company in my opinion is it willingness to stand behind their product and resolve their customer 's issue this is especially true with a new brand which has not yet established a track record to date they have been unwilling to work with me but i am hopeful we can work it out i 'll undate my review then techically the contrast range of this lcd is not capable of showing both deep blacks and highlight detail at the same time this makes movie watching a poor experience but i 've found it suitable for general viewing children 's cartoons etc of course once you loose 1200 pixels the picture quality does n't matter that much and you can only hope the company will support you !
i was extremely pleased with the speedy delivery which was less than a week ! ! ! the new flat panel lcd tv has a great picture and is a real pleasure to watch i would definitely purchase more products from tiger direct as i enjoy their discounted prices and efficient service thank you ! !
my tv started to have sound problems and i sent off an email to olevia no response then tried calling support had to leave a message days later after no response i called and transferred to sales helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back no luck with call back 3 weeks go by and now i am getting rather ticked at the no response so rewrote email again no response called tech support and left my number no response again called sales and got another person got a live body yaaahoo ! could not help but forwarded me to customer service to give me the service at home number customer service could not help and said tech support were the ones to talk to after an hour plus on hold i get to talk to a tech hour later he came to the conclusion that i needed service the support issue is really bad my recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the tv oh and good luck ! ! !
this is the one of these we purchased in the last 18 months this one began to skip after 2 weeks the first one worked for over a yea
i bought this low priced pedal mainly for my daughter as a starter to my surpise there was no power supply included ! not even a battery no mention on amazon 's product description that a power supply for the unit was not included i also bought the other two models this one picks up a radio station and broadcasts it thru the amp yet there is n't a radio station tower within 5 miles of my house all in all i feel i got ripped off if i had known they did not come with power supplies i would not have purchased them
this would be probably be best for a mini it was just too tight for the color screen ipod after working hard to squeeze it in i had to pull it back out to make any selections on the ipod it looks good and fits well but it 's just not
i bought these to make labels for my dvds as when i received them there is a warning on the back that if you use them on dvds they may make the dvd unreadable these are only to be used on cds memorex makes specific labels that are plasic for dvds and do not warp when exposed to the heat of a dvd player 2 stars because the packaging is misleading
the labels are fine and dandy but the software that comes with them is horrid not only did the calibration page not print but there is no way to an image to a desired resolution so i can enhance the enlarged image also what did print ended up looking grainy in the end i had to appropriately resize and print my own images adding white borders to the left and top edges to get it to center on the label
well i thought that this was going to be the answer for getting a decent xm signal but again ford expeditons 2004 and up have a built in antenna in the rear passenger side windwow the xm transmitter is not powerful enough to send a decent signal all the way back there to a lousy antenna idea anyway i peeked through crutchfield and used their compatability engine for my said that this item would work and special equipment i took apart the dash peeked at the radio antenna input and was surprised well not really it is a ford after all to find that ford uses a proprietary antenna plug so far i am unable to find an adapter that will let me use this adapter in my vehicle hence the 1 star nice concept too bad i shelled out 25 bucks for something that does n't fit my vehicle
i originally purchased the adapter for my roadie 2 which i returned but i am now using it with my xpress no sound fluctuation at all it is exactly what i expected
bought this drive primarily for the 5 yr warranty for the 2 years it was in service drive was error free and operated relatively noise free disk died on me around the anniversary sent to seagate for data recovery balked at the estimate of 1500 most data recovery efforts will void the warranty anyway in future i will be more focussed on taking backups and paying less attention to the warranty details
headphone cord is very thin it broke in half amazon quickly sent me a new radio but that one broke also so i got a refund amazon sent me a postage paid label to return the radios
reception horrible got as gift and never used i feel terrible for putting on my wish list
if after reading all the negative reviews you say this product ca n't possibly be this bad '' like i did well you 'd be wrong even the strongest fm stations that come in perfectly clearly with the cheapest throwaway radios are garbled noisy and on this radio this product is a blot on sony 's reputation
i have been using the sony walkman receivers for years and am familiar with the product two major problems with this model first setting radio stations with this model i need the instructions is much more difficult than in the previous model intuitive second the reception is horrible
i had the model before this one and it had great radio reception i got this one and everything is fuzzy i am going to return it but what a pain ! you would think the reception would be good for sony
i purchased the previous model 3 times as i wore it out with daily use 10 hr a day work they lasted about 1 years to 3. this is honestly a piece of crap ! i am working at the same office same area many of my radio channels do n't come in some of the tv channels are n't clear before all tv channels were crystal clear only a few of my radio channels did n't come in clearly while walking on the street the same most of my radio or tv channels come through with static i went online with sony the help was truly poor go to this website do this did n't work the small changes like 1 aaa battery instead of 2 may be part of the problem a friend purchased it also sent it back i 'm hoping sony will change this walkman up quickly again please do n't waste your on this version it 's sony 's worst walkman
the price was reasonable the screen size is great the few channels that did come in had a great picture and the sound was only problem is it automatically tuned into channels so my local channels did not all come in only the spanish stations came in clearly and i do not understand spanish it does not have a dial for you to go to channels and that is a big draw back seeing our 20 yr plus old portable tv has that feature and all my local channels come in on that one this tv would be perfect if they can make one with a dial for channels and not auto tune
i bought this tv to use during lunch breaks at work and to take to football games it could n't pickup any vhf channels and could only pickup the same 2 uhf channels the next day i shipped it back for a refund
i have done a lot of research on gps devices and tomtom one appeared to have more bang for the buck out of the box and it does you turn it on configure it type in the addresses and it works up until you decide to install tomtom home and connect tomtom to the computer tomtom asks if you want to connect it to the computer and you say yes then you turn on tomtom home and it states there are no devices connected i 've tried three different tomtoms on three different computers from three different stores all bestbuy after a few hours with their customer service and returning the device to the store twice i 'm on my third tomtom in 3 days they finally said i should exchange the device or mail it back to them so they can reload the software on the tomtom after reading horror stories of lost tomtoms i 'm not taking my chance i 'm going to return it and lose the restocking fee i 'm very disappointed one of the features is tomtom plus traffic and weather updates in order to activate it you have to connect to tomtom home which means connecting it to your computer works great as long as you dont connect it to your computer
initially my tomtom one was excellent then i made the fatal mistake of allowing tomtom home to automatically upgrade the software the device never worked again because it could no longer find any satellites ! my computer has the maximum security offered by windows xp and norton internet security so it seems unlikely that the process was contaminated in any way on 11 feb i contacted customer service nice courteous responses but no solution finally on their advice i returned it to the retailer on 27 it finally arrived at tomtom service on march that was the last i have heard of it ! ! ! i rang tomtom customer service on april and they could not trace the unit over the following 2.5 weeks i tried a series of faxes and online service queries but have received absolutely no human intervention or assistance in summary i bought a good '' product the online software stuffed it up and over the following two months tomtom service achieved nothing except for apparently loosing my tomtom ! ! ! postscript finally almost two months after seeking replacement of the faulty item i have been advised that it is to be replaced no apology or expression of regret from tomtom but at least i will have a gps even though i vowed never to tangle with tomtom customer service '' again and i am free to choose the replacement model and manufacturer i have found that tomtom one still offers the best balance for my purposes i just hope that my new tomtom runs well so that i will not have to be serviced '' again by tomtom
i dont like this mouse i brought and never work its useles
i think this is a very bad wireless mouse it did n't work wireless for me even though i charged the battery for more than 4 hours according to the manual so i had to connect the recharging cable with it all the time that makes it a wired mouse ! ! ! the buttons on the receiver and mouse are so tiny that you have to use a pen or something to press it the battery cover is hard to open this mouse does not have a sensitive signal the motion of the cursor lags behind your mouse terrible mouse ! !
i had to buy a new one and i chose another brand logitech this time there is no button so the batteries run out if you do n't take them out i think the buttons are pressed during transportation now the battery contacts are not functioning properly and i had the same problem described in a recent review i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen ''
i wish i read the reviews before i bought this thing unfortunately extremely user unfriendly to connect and disconnects itself often kills batteries even in sleep mode the size and precision is good when it does work but definitely not worth the money i exchanged it for a new one thinking it was just the first unit but still terrible
do not buy this may be the worst product i 've ever bought it has never worked properly i 've kept fresh batteries in it but it 's still no good within 10 feet of the laptop i 'll click three or four times and nothing happens then i 'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it 's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen awful product believe the bad reviews it 's worse than they describe the only positive thing i can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy my cat loves the laser pointer
do not buy this mouse ! this mouse has given me nothing but frustration 1. the front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time 2. battery life is horrible like 2 weeks 3. when your mouse is idle for 8 minutes it goes into an automatic sleep mode the manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to revive '' it but when i do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen so i have to reboot my computer absolutely the worst ! !
bought one pair they broke after three weeks static sound and dropping sound from one channel exchanged for another pair and they broke after one week same sound issues worst headphones ever
purchased these to use while jogging to replace my broken aiwa swoops the sound quality is horrible i ca n't stress it enough it would n't even be worth it for 99 cents
thought this would work with my new ipod shuffle but no super deal if you have the right ipod i offered the two items as to but i had a long line of folks who tried them on their newer ipods and failed to get them to work if you have an older ipod you 're likely to succeed with these
i bought this remote to use with my ipod with clickwheel and despite installing as instructed i could not get this to operate it fit the ipod very well so i figured i would not have a problem i have also used maxell products in the past and also have n't had any problems the remote lit up but it would not operate any of the functions when i pointed it at my ipod maybe this is a great product and i did something wrong but it is easy to install and mine would not work i returned the remote to amazon as defective and received a refund for it again this might be a great product but i wanted to write a review to warn other customers that i had problems with it
pros burner works great i 've gotten only 1 coaster in 6 months nice design cons it is loud ! ! sounds like someone groaning there was some previous reviews of noise factor but i vastly underestimated it it 's hard to concentrate on watching movies i advise buying another model or even another brand
i have a 2006 lexus and this item failed miserably the skip function did not work and the unit randomly changed the tracks on the ipod without any user intervention and the mechanism itself made so much noise that when the music was set at a lower volume you could hear the cassette mechanism turning over the music top that off the sound quality provided by the unit was fair at best disaster
i own a infiniti this product makes a lot of noise and the skip feature did not work in the
i have an infiniti coupe and have been using a standard cassette adapter just fine based on this i felt that the smartdeck would be a great upgrade however it would not work at all ! no sound no skipping tracks nothing it just switches fron side a to side b and then ejects the price was great but you may have to return it be prepared
to say that i 've wanted to throw this out of my car window countless times may be a strong indication of how poorly it works never have i encountered a product that works so poorly do n't even consider owning this accessory if you live in an area of the country that dips below 60 degrees it seems the product works even worse in the cold ! upon pluggin my ipod into the smartdeck the adapter makes my ipod jump from song to song playing the first a second of each it 's rare that i 'm able to get the adapter to play the ipod normally i will no doubt be shopping around the competition for a stronger more reliable piece of equipment for my ipod
i 've read many of the reviews of the sorely disappointed and i understand their complaints since i 've also experienced many of the same problems there are however some workarounds that might help some of the stuckees regarding leading to static i 've learned through trial and error that the volume is fairly random due to variations in mechanical position of its head relative to the tape deck head if the volume is set too high or low try plugging the smartdeck in and out a few times or reach your finger in and see if you can jiggle its position picking an especially loud song while you do this will help you to know when you have successfully adjusted to a good volume unfortunately this workaround does n't work for all ipods although i can always successfully find a good position with my generation ipod i 've noticed that the output from the ipod mini is significantly louder and therefore much harder to adjust this way regarding the problem i 've noticed that i only get this problem when the smartdeck is cold usually first thing in the morning clearly this is the tape deck thinking the smartdeck is a jammed tape try warming the smartdeck by blowing warm breath into the hole where the fake tape '' is then put it back in in cold weather the deck itself is also going to be cold so you may have to do this several times until the entire car warms up it seems to me that this problem has become less pronounced over time i rarely have to do this more than once nowadays unfortunately i do n't have a workaround for the intermittent problem i have seen that once or twice though in general that feature tends to work for me both track skip and track i have a suspicion that this is another cold weather problem and a side effect of the problem but now that i have a workaround for the latter problem i 've not seen this problem in over a year ironically if you manage to avoid all these warts the smartdeck is the adapter i 've ever heard plus the feature is much more valuable than you might think and no one seems to complain that this feature is broken with the four other adapters i 've tried two cassette and two fm transmitter i can not tell you how many times i forgot to turn my ipod off when i exited the car then came back to a dead ipod nevertheless the warts are pretty obnoxious therefore i must deduct 3 stars from this otherwise product
works in suburban gain is too high and not adjustable so when changing tfrom radio ro cd to ipod it blasts you with volume and also the sound quality is compromised by the gain it does not charge the ipod nor can it be connected to a charger because it necessarily uses the docking port on the ipod belkin makes made a charger that plugged into the docking port and then accepted an earphone jack from a separate tape the belkin solution had a gain adjustment which was very useful but it was not possible to use the vehichle 's controls to control the ipod using the controls works for on and off and it is great that the ipod stops when i switch to the radio or turn the car audio off going to the next song or backwards works with a delay that is not terrible when i use the car controls i am in shuffle mode so it 's if i want to find a particular song i pick up the ipod if the smartdeck was had gain adjustment and a charger it would be a lot better we really need to pop the ipod into a hole in the dash and control it completely from the dash with all the ipod screen infor visible on the car stereo until then the smartdeck is a couple steps forward and a couple steps back becasue of the gain issue i would not buy it again unless it had a gain adjustment
i read the bad reviews but i bought it it worked for one week and died pure junk avaoid anything by griffin
do not buy this system for the money there are much better systems out there i bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers the main problem with the system which bose has corrected by the way is that the acoustimass '' component bose 's fancy name for a subwoofer is not active or powered which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges the result is that you get a very tinny '' sound out of most applications including dvd 's i ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better in hindsight i would have bought a different brand than bose but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely and the size of the cubes is nice still pissed that i spent that much money on a substandard system but hey got sucked into the bose marketing machine
i have been very disappointed by these speakers i have the series iii ones while the treble sounds fine perfectly clear this system has no bass ! my husband recently bought a 35 set of 2 computer speakers and subwoofer and his setup sounds better than mine ! because the subwoofer feeds power off the it 's hooked up to and does not have its own direct power supply or amplifier it literally lacks power this subwoofer is the biggest joke ever ! i can barely hear the bass on most things even with the volume cranked up bose products are extremely overrated and overpriced do not waste your money buy something worthwhile for a fraction of the price ! and make sure the subwoofer has its own line to outlet
this is one half of the garmin automotive mount for garmin gps map 72 and gps 76 only search item 101025700 in amazon to see both parts
this mount wo n't work with the streetpilot it 's really designed for the 2700 series types wish i had known that before purchasing it
comes with lousy instructions and is not complete as far as i can tell
this factory refurbished model 360 gps worked for about ten hours initially it worked fine it then failed to pick up the satellite signal or would loose the signal as a drove along on a trip i called tech support for help twice the service personnel are very difficult to understand and they also have trouble understanding me it is a language issue they suggested various tests and reprogramming but it did not correct the problem the unit was fifteen days past the 90 day warrantee so they wanted me to ship back the unit and charge me 144.00 to examine it i ca n't afford to pour any more money down that hole for ten hours of service stay away from the refurbished unit and do n't buy a new unit without an extended warrantee
have been using the gps for past 3 months used it in miami hawaii boston new york and new jersey its not very accurate on the map nor the poi 's i have taken alternate route number of times because of the gps giving wrong directions but if you are in a budget its a good buy
the first that i received produced no sound with tv it was returned the replacement produces no sound within seconds of starting the cd player i can not keep carrying these to ups for return and will need to buy some other cd player
this product looked light it was one of the best made usb out there except the light and the fan burned out after 1 month of use because of overheating
this is a very well designed light and works very well you have better control of the light snake neck light types the quailty of light put out is good and is not so bright as to create glare there is one major flaw in this light it has a very short life span it died after only two months
i 've had the turntable for about a month it worked relatively well with the included cartrdge there was some minor hum but it was only noticable with my receiver 's volume up very loud with no record playing i tried installing a sure cartridge for playing 78 rpm records and the problems started there was noticable hum even when playing records i also installed an cartridge this cartridge gets very good reviews from audio weenies the hum was outrageous from the second i turned the thing on the cartridge works fine in my brother 's old kenwood unit i tried using the turntable with the internal preamp and with the one in my receiver as well as connecting directly to my mac for cd burning the problem persists the unit will be going back tomorrow very disappointing
we bought this for the kitchen after much research and waiting two weeks for it to ship from amazon we were very excited to open it up and get going the first problem was apparent before we even plugged it in no remote in the box then we plugged it in and proceeded through the setup there was a two inch green stripe running vertically down the middle of the tv no amount of adjustment to the settings would make it go away we had to send it back but amazon no longer had them i will give it one more try from another supplier but if it has the slightest problem i 'm buying something else
i saw this set at the store and it was a magnificent picture has an integrated hdtv tuner and all the connections you will need looks sweet too however i got one off amazon which was a dud poor picture quality and white light bleed from the top and bottom of the screen a problem another customer complained about samsung telephone service help was great and agreed it was defective amazon was terrific and paid for the return and refund be careful with this set and wait a little for other feedback oh one annoying feature while the hdtv tuner works well you can not dial in a specific digital channel like 10.1 unless the search program has previously found it and there is no way to save '' the found digital channels so that you can reposition the antennae search for signals again and then have a compiled list channels locked into the memory in other words if your search found 10.1 in one antenna position but not 6.1 there is no way the tv will let you dial in 6.1 even if you reposition the antenna optimally you must then reprogram the search to find 6.1 but then after that is completed you wont be able to dial in 10.1 after turning antenna back because the tv did not permanently store that channel prior to the new search my 32 '' sony can do this no problem
i 'm a tech who recently tried to help install configure the wifi printer server card which later turned out to be faulty installing this printer card properly can become a nightmare ! it took over two hrs with helpful but slow online live help hp support to finally figure out the card was bad there are also possible firmware upgrade issues on this wifi device to be aware of setting up the different profiles for this rig is not for the novice
i had this computer for one day and when it worked it was slow and noisy i took it on a trip and it occupied most of the desk i used for my laptop how anyone could call this a portable '' is beyond me what a waste of money ! then after a week of use i plugged it into the usb port and wham ! it killed my computer for two hours ! when the computer started running again guess what no usb ports ! i got on tech support and confirmed that the printer fried my usb ports if you really feel you have to have this printer warning get the pcmcia card with usb and printer power port you wo n't get your usb ports zapped dead ! let the buyer beware ! my next portable will be a canon
i recommend that you pass on this printer i tried to install the software and kept getting the following error setup has encountered a severe error and will exit i went to the hp support site and followed the instructions there for this error and still got the error i sent a message to tech support and did n't get an answer i tried the online support but kept getting disconnected when i would reboot after trying to install windows kept doing a disk check save your money or buy the canon
i bought this to replace my linksys router and linksys access point mistake ! everything worked fine out of the box but my wan performance went down 66 with linksys i had internet download speeds of but with this i get i ca n't get it to go any faster i have switched back and forth between the two to no avail what is the problem does anybody know i 'm wishing i would n't have bought it now wasted my money
after frimware update it completely stop working followed all the instructions correctly hard reset and did everything i can i could not recover do not buy bottom line
bought the about 6 months ago worked like a charm until this past week my internet connection would suddenly cut out and only be accessible again after a hard reset then the administration panel would be unaccessible for several hours i tried installing the latest firmware patch to see if it would help big mistake the wireless stopped working completely and permanently technical support was awful i 'll applaud them for taking my calls quickly but razz them for not knowing a thing about what they were talking about pretty much a waste of time to have them read me verbatum content straight out of the knowledge base only to have them finally say gee it sounds like the router may be broken take it back to the retailer '' so i did and with a refund in hand i went for the peace of mind of a new linksys
there are already quite a few negative reviews on this router but just in case you are still considering buying it here 's one more this router simply does n't work i 'm on a second one after returning the first completely inoperable one this second one is just as frustrating and is a waste of space i am constantly resetting it in hopes of it magically working sometimes it works for 15 seconds long enough to load one page and when i try to go to the next page it is already dead again arrgh if i had to choose between the old days with dial up on aol using this router and completely unreliable access i 'd go for aol with all of its and disconnects please avoid this product finally even if the price were reduced by 75 it still would not be a good buy
in the past i have good impressions of dlink products with the combination of features and price but this particular router is one to stay away from dlink should have tested the product much more extensively before releasing it the original firmware jan 2005 is full of bugs and two attempts at upgrades made the router unusable dlink support attempted to be helpful but it seems that they are not aware of the problems with this particular router and the responses i received were not helpful at all after going through two routers i returned them to the store and bought an airlink superg at half the price on sale and worked flawlessly the first time around i like the feature set and the web gui is pleasant but the bugs are too severe and make the product unusable 1. dns does n't work after a short period of time 2. incorrect listing of dhcp clients 3. upgrade of firmware cause the web application on the router to die ''
can i give it negative stars i actually have no idea how it works on my palm treo 680 i was never able to get that far i installed the software to my windows xp desktop and it would not allow me to install the palm software no device found ran my cpu at 100 and refused to let go or be terminated and then crashed my computer on reboot i discovered that it 's autostarting sucking 100 of my cpu wo n't let go wo n't terminate and as soon as i opened the ui it crashed my computer
i can occasionally get my logitech cordless mouseman optical mouse to work on this pad but before long it just stops tracking not surprising since the pad is a smooth solid black surface it 's also quite large and rigid so i had a hard time fitting it into my desk 's tray alongside my keyboard had to ditch the wrist pad and turn it sideways i 've given up on it i guess if you have the space and the right mouse it would be a nice mousepad but it was not the right purchase for me
i started my own business and purchased this item because of my past experiences with hp laser jets one year later i 'm about to throw it out the window and buy a new printer why first of all even when printing in black and white the device uses color ink approximately 97 of my printing is black and white yet the color ink cartridge levels are consistently depleted as a result i have to purchase what a surprise hp color inks even though i do n't ever use them i estimate that 's cost me about over the last year the second reason i despise this machine relates to its annoying warning message boxes when ink is running low in any cartridge a appears they can not be disabled they appear until the ink cartridge is completely empty since the machine depletes color inks at such minute levels these messages can appear for days or until you replace it with another expensive hp ink cartridge lastly the machine will not operate if any of the ink cartridges are empty i ca n't tell you how many times i 've wanted to print a simple black and white document but could not because the machine was out of pink or yellow ink clearly hp has decided that the best way to make money is through ink sales if they 'd focused more on the customer 's ultimate experience they 'd have secured me as a repeat customer
do you want to print photos cad images how about a pdf well if so then avoid this printer yes such simple tasks will not be possible it has so little memory just a guess that it fails on nearly everything i send to it as well the same trouble with paper misfeeds etc you read about below are entirely true
this printer is capable of producing high quality documents but it frequently jams and requires surgery through the back door to get out tiny scraps of paper often i have to lift open the top door to get at the ink injector which gets hung up with paper also the printer crimps the top left corner of every document the scanner function works well and i have had no problems there the fax capability is poorly laid out and has never worked overall whatever cost you pay is not worth the frustration i would spend my money elsewhere
this unit looks nice and plays nice until it does n't anymore this piece of crap worked for only 3 months and was turned on about only as it stood in my bedroom where i only seldom listen to music it went dead all of a sudden and sony does n't honor the limited warranty ! ! apparently what i have a short circuit that prevents me from turning the unit on is a common defect and it 's even mentioned in the owner 's manual ie if you get standy flashing you 're in trouble ! i had several bad experiences with sony this will be my last my advice is stay with panasonics they 're way way way better
the system looked great and was a great price but after a few months the cd changer died and would n't open with my cds in it and of course you threw out the box so how are you going to ship this not so micro thing back and how much is that going to 's heavy and so you have a 99 radio
overall sound quality is poor product does not allow for recording music from cd to casette for flintstones like me controls are difficult to master taught me a lesson that all stereo appliances should be purchased in store
the unit looks good and sounds good but it will only play about 1 out of 10 discs that i try it on a total bummer on xmas morning for my son who could not listen to the 5 brand new cds he also received the unit tries to spin up and read the disc but fails and displays no disc ''
these are supposed to be a replacement for the stylus well they are close but not exact they do not fit snug in the stylus channel when the ipaq is inverted they fall out yes it 's a stylus and yes it works but it is a pain the the neck
this unit never really worked properly from the start i would get the fearsome little balloon in the bottom right of xp that said delayed write failed '' fairly often then one day i plugged it in and xp would not recognize it at all tried in in three different computers linux and xp and still did n't work popped out the drive inside hooked it up to the computer directly via the ata cable and the drive works find so the enclosure was the culprit bad
not recommended the fan has a tendency to come unbalanced and start buzzing loud enough to be heard in the next room with the door shut i bought three of them and both started giving this problem within 10 days of continuous use the buzzing issue can be triggered by repositioning or touching the enclosure slightly or by opening or closing drawers in the desk that it is resting on the buzzing can be stopped by taking the case apart and applying pressure to the bearing at the center of the fan underneath the sticker or sometimes by stopping and starting the fan but it usually returns anywhere from 10 minutes later for the worst one of mine to 1 week later for the best one this is n't just a case of the wires touching the fan as the fan still buzzes with the enclosure opened the hard drive removed and the wires out of the way
i have n't had the opportunity to use these cables my electronics are denon and be warned they will not work with these cables hdmi to
first of all the cable is very difficult to install it 's rigid and not flexible after i connected my cable box and my lcd hdtv with this monster cable hdmi my service provider time warner cable told me that they do n't support hdmi i should use the component cable that comes with the cable box well i already opend the box and it 's too late to return every now and then i get a message on my tv saying you can not use hdmi cale please use the component cable to watch tv '' i had to turn my tv off and on to get rid of that screen some hd channels ' volumes are very low i have to turn to the loudest in order to listen has it anything to do with the cable time warner wo n't care the sales guys from circuit city said it 's must to get bla bla bla in order to watch best high definition channels this hdmi cable is one of the recommendations i 'm too naive to trust them i should have researched more before making a purchase i do n't like the cable at all sooner it 'll destroy either port the cable or the tv
as for digital technology monster cable has once again ruined the marketplace by greatly over estimating what their products are worth the great difference with the digital devices compared to analog is simple if the digital signal reaches the device it needs to it ca n't be any more or less clear because your digital signal is comprised of 0 's '' and 1 's '' if you can see your tv or hear the music then what ever cable you use there is no distortation across digital signals so do n't pay the extra in fact you should n't need to spend more than around
i did n't see this fact in any of the other reviews of this player i have had it for about 24 hours my discovery is that there is no way to resume playing a disc after the power is turned off in other words if you watch a dvd and decide you want to stop for awhile the player has no function which allows you to resume from the point at which you stopped if you 've turned the power off believe me i tried everything the bookmark feature looked promising until i read the information that all bookmarks are reset when the power is turned off i have never seen a dvd player that did n't have the resume feature no matter how inexpensive the pluses of this player primarily the georgous screen and the remote do not compensate for the omission of this feature in fact a portable player would certainly seem to be subject to watching for awhile then stopping and then how cumbersome to have to sort through the dvd menu assuming your dvd has one ! to try and find the place where you left off were it not for the ommission of this feature i would have rated this player as 4 stars and would have definitely kept it
after receiving the item i installed it in my explorer and gave it a test run while out christmas shopping the picture quality on the main unit was outstanding however the other monitor had distortion and what looked to be signal problems i returned the item and received another from amazon kudos to amazon for being so fast with the replacement i installed the second item and had the same problems needless to say we returned that one too and went with a different dvd player
i 'm sorry to say that this product failed to meet my expectations pros tight connection to laptop cons easy to accidentally change the combination which makes it difficult to set the combo and remove the lock product is built to fit on the right side of a laptop if you 're laptop is like mine where the plug is on the left side you have to turn the laptop around in order to unlock it unless you do n't mind doing it backwards
a terrible product extremely difficult to use way too easy to accidentally change the combination and when that happens it 's useless the only reason it gets one star is that the rating system does not allow a zero or a negaive number do n't waste your money on this product
sound is fine for ipod music the radio stations do not come in one local station tunes to all our 20 boom box gets better reception
i am returning this item because the handle screw does n't fit into the popcorn pot has anyone else had this problem
i 've had one of these for 3 years now and it 's spent the last few months gathering dust why because the case design while does not allow for proper air circulation or ventilation of the drive so that it runs much hotter internally than it ought to i replaced the drive twice each one lasted months before it failed i ca n't think of any reason for this other than heat if i do use the case again i 'll run it without the stylish cover
i bought a sharp lcd tv from j r in new york last jan after a year and half when powering on the tv sometimes works sometimes not after unplug in wait for a while and plug back worked for a couple months send it to service center to checkup was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced when request to get back the replaced lcd control board was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board it has to be shipped back otherwise you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced it 's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any but if you do want to get a sharp better get a long long
i bought this product because out of the 4 different printer servers i was looking at this was the only one that said it supports the i brought it home got it up and operating but it only printer a test page and would never do more i could n't even cancel the print job did not recognize the scanner either i checked the supported printers via the onboard printer list and the website and neither said the was supported only the box had it listed i called customer service and they told me the box was wrong and it did not support my printer
failed to operate as advertised and barely operated at all printing was extremely slow and often timed out technical support was useless i returned this and bought the brand new linksys multifunction prints server which is working fine
do n't buy this product the first one i got was doa plugged it in nothing happened i returned that one to bestbuy picked up a second one that one worked for about 5 minutes then became completely unresponsive must have had a bad batch of these come off the assembly line i suggest avoiding it all together i returned mine and bought a belkin works great and with far more printers
it took about 10 hours of work to make it function with a macbook running os x and an epson cx 6400 and i needed a windows xp pc to set it up but yes it works for mac installation the trick is that using the windows xp pc connected with wire not wirelessly you need to change the static ip of the server to a dhcp given by your router and then you have to go trial an error with your browser to find whatever address it was assigned on the mac set it up as an lpd printer also make sure you type the queue name exactly as it is shown on the status screen and god help you if you do n't have one of the printers listed on the packaging
i just bought a one anf tried in sacramento area the sound quality is really bad i tried all channels and tried to reduce the volume too you ca n't enjoy the music coming through this gadget quality of sound is not good at all
i just received and tested this item the idea and the design looked very attractive especially the usb port but your guess is right ! this modulator produces a lot of static noise and music and voice comes dull i tried all 14 frequencies do not buy this item ! i give my respect to the seller they delivered it quickly but i am going to return this item
this is the worst sounding guitar in the world i was looking for a cheap guitar because i was n't really serious in playing and i expected much better the amp is the worst one i 've ever heard in my life the strap is really bad quality too i played on it for 30 minutes a day for a week and its already falling off do not buy anything first act ever the brand is really cheap and is garbage
i am very unhappy about this i need to buy a good name brand for an instrument this is poor quality and i returned it very displeased
dont buy this guitar it is a piece of love guitars i rarely ever put mine when i saw this guitar it looks ok but it plays like a guitar made out of rubber bands it is not worth the advice invest a little more money in a guitar that is made better you can also find it on this site it is the berringer is a great guitar for any style of play and any level of was my first guita
i own the version of this drive it is tiny but still fits nicely into a usb port but i have noticed a serious problem the flash stick itself is actually smaller than the casing it is in you can see it on the bottom i have been very careful with how i store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from usb ports regardless the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top and the bottom corners of the plastic shell that go into a usb port have started snapping off in little chunks
sony disc player does not work it wo n't recognize disc in player currently trying to get it serviced under warranty
i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just 5 months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player
as you 've read previously this is such a terrible drop in quality for sony i do n't know what it was i 'm guessing they 're sacrificing quality for quantity whatever it is this cd player is the pits compared with previous sony models
i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are '' that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture first the bad the control buttons sound changing tracks pause etc are tiny and nearly impossible to read i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button and i do not have any vision problems the little lcd screen is hard to read as well next the sound quality is poor and has a cheap watered down '' feel to it then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with these are cheap and do n't fit well i bought a yellow psyc '' sony walkman a couple years ago and that one is 3 times the product that this one is the sound is and the buttons are easy to see and use the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all i would n't write sony off simply of this product but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them
the remote antenna for my garmin grabs more satellites and increases performance this antenna did not increase signal but allowed me to move the magellan down on the console where i prefer it so it depends on why you are buying it
i found this paper on amazon as an accessory to the olympus camedia printer this paper does not fit the because this paper is too wide thus with the this paper is useless
you would think that when you buy a bracket of any sort the package would include the mounting screws well this does n't and you are n't made of aware of that until you open the box i 'm a strong advocate of linksys products but this falls under the category of screw the customer ''
i purchased these cans hoping the ney sayers were extreme audiophiles and the praisers were average people turns out the ney sayers were average people like me these headphones have zero bass none i love bass i have had 15 pairs of headphones some of them 20 dollars that have better bass i thought maybe these might just have a nice clean sound by heavy bass i would rather have a pair of tweeters on my ears they look so good though i actually took a decent pair of headphones and put the speakers from those in the skull candies let me tell you it 's the design of the cup they made the good speakers sound like dooky so if you want somthing that looks great around your neck like jewlery get these if you want good headphones get a pair of sennheisers sp they have affordable stuff that sounds great
this is all looks and no sound quality at all bass is terrible i would n't waste my money on this again i listen to hard rock mostly and the bass just sounds muddy and distorted i have connected it to my ipod and stereo and the results are similar do n't waste your money on this i did like the bag that came with it though i guess you get what you pay for
the sound is clear but carries no base i have a pair of sony i paid 20.00 for that i was going to replace i needed more volume and not loose sound quality for my player these headphones are not it ! even at low volume all you get are the highs there is no depth to the sound at all i guess it all depends on what you want them for if you listen to heavy metal save you money on this series anyway the more expensive series may be better but i 'm not going spend more money on something that may or may not give me sound quality i want they look good sitting on the shelf though
had the printer for just over a year with light use i started getting numerous error messages then the printer would stop printing in the middle of a page or i could n't get it to print at all spent over two hours in a hp chat session that made little sense was told to push buttons my printer does n't have and when i told the rep that nothing happened after a procedure to the printer she replied great that means it worked '' was then offered the option of getting the printer serviced for 290 the same price i paid for it a year ago or upgrading to a for 300 which is 20 more than the current price on amazon this product has been a waste of time money and energy
we 've had this machine for 2 years and the automatic feeder started its problems whenever we try to use it for faxing or copying sheets would get stuck together this is very annoying because it is extremely painful to track which pages got or not this is the most annoying feature and because of it i 'm not recommending it
i have owned the printer for one year the only reason i gave the printer two stars was because when it prints only reliably printing via usb the pictures are beautiful the copy scan and fax features work i have not used the duplex if you want to print via a network then almost all print jobs will sponsor an error message this document failed to print '' a single print job may eventually print out with multiple error messages and printing line by line with many pauses during the printing process i usually cancel the print job drag the usb cable to the pc i want to print from and restart the print job when first purchased i made multiple calls resulting in many hours on the phone with technical support mostly they suggested that i reinstall the hp software the last call asked i reinstall windows which i was unwilling to do a few months ago i did however purchase a new notebook and freshly installed the hp pinter software on it which did not work love the notebook by the way regular and tier support was offshore each person tried hard but was unable to support beyond reading from a script having little real technical knowledge gone are the days of the solid hp printer product
when i recieved the 7310 it would not work and i quickly came to the conclusion that the ethernet connection was bad i spent a considerable amount of time on a chat session with an hp rep and got nowhere i emailed support the next day and never got a reply to the email i spent at least an hour on the phone with a rep who came to totally rediculus conclusions he told me i had to have the ethernet connection directly to my router no switch could be tollerated and he told me the max length for the cable was 10 feet i was always told the cable switch or router were bad or i had screwed up settings on the unit or did not have my router settings right the next day i spent another hour plus on the phone and finally was bumped up one level of support i told the guy i have an electrical engineering degree explaind the symptoms again explained what had been tried again and in under two minutes he told me i would get a new unit with return shipping for the one i had the new one came and worked fine but i would be totally incensed if i were trying to use it in a business
i really needed this printer i even overlooked the 'shaking ' of the printer and table it sat on during printing in less than a scanner errors began and the ink catridge symbols are a problem i have always loved hp but now will try a canon printer
i got the sharp wizard because i just wanted a simple way to organize my calendar and list without spending tons of money on a bunch of functions i did n't need and wo n't use aka a palm pilot or blackberry in the beginning i was pleased with this product but over time i noticed that it has some serious flaws in the way in synchs up to microsoft outlook it duplicates tasks and meetings erases some meetings and keeps others and sometimes things you 've added to the wizard wo n't show up on outlook after you 've synched it it 's a nice little product if you 're not thinking of hooking it up to a computer once you do that though it becomes more of a pain than anything not only that but recently i 've found that a synch will succeed about once every five tries otherwise it just sits in preparing schedule '' mode for literally 20 minutes before the synch is terminated by the system folks just spend the money and get something better i give it 2 stars because it 's easy to use and the layout of the functions is simple however the task list slips out of date due '' order all the time and just lists them in seemingly random order there 's no way to sort tasks other than done '' or pending '' if you sort by date in outlook it rarely shows up that way on the wizard also schedules on the wizard are listed by day but each day does n't show the date on it so if you 're looking at several days worth of meetings you ca n't tell what day of the week you 're looking at lastly the memory just is n't enough i 've had the unit about 4 weeks and have n't put that much in it and already it 's down to 75 free space that 's just not enough i would not recommend this product
i was unable to get it to sync up with our computer and we have windows 2000. so it was no use to me
the software will not load correctly on my networked printer there is no synchronizatio
this is a nice organizer for the price easy to use and has all the basic features but it would n't synchronize with outlook 2003 on a windows xp computer without the sync feature it 's worthless to me i contacted sharp support several times but they could not find a solution despite this they referred me back to amazon for a refund which i ca n't get because it 's been more than 30 days since i received the product i 'm unhappy with the product and i 'm unhappy with sharp
i recently bought this product for my palm tx and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip it is n't apparent in the photos but there is a screw attached to the back of the case which makes it impossible to lay flat this i found extremely annoying the clip which you can take on and off is extremely cheap and does n't secure well it flops and swirls around otherwise the case would be fine i do not recommend
the micro has some excellent features at the right price but it fails to work all the time first it was the firmware then it would n't connect to my pc now the hardware has failed i am going to buy an i pod despite apple 's refusal to allow other forms of downloads
i 've had my micro for over a year now and when it worked i loved it ! however i 'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue the sound is output in layers and i am constantly trying to reposition '' my headphones to get full sound my husband called creative labs for assistance and he was told that it would cost him per month for a customer service subscription '' after reading these reviews it seems we 'd be paying creative labs so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can or will do next brand please
this is a huge regret for me the iaudio is more an expensive portable hard drive than anything else the navigation sucks there is no way to organize your music etc like the songs are all there but they are n't seperated by it 's just a big list as someone who has over 20 songs that 's a problem ! the provided program is full of glitches and despite many calls to customer service i could hardly get anything on it the folders would appear on the drive of the iaudio but it would not let me open them i consider myself to be a computer savvy person and if i ca n't get this machine working for me i doubt the average person could either after a month of frustration i gave it to a friend who could not get it working either past getting a mess of unorganized songs on it 2 months later it broke and customer service was no help at all currently it 's sitting in a drawer somewhere what a waste of money ! yes this iaudio looks attractive and offers more than the ipod for less but it 's not worth the hassle the only positive thing i have to say about this player is that the audio quality is great but it does n't make much difference on a player that does n't do what i need it to ! i am not a fan of apple but i got a second hand ipod for cheap and i am very happy with it i also purchased the creative zen visionm and i love it ! ! ! i am kind of obsessed with music after a lot of research i 'd stick with creative or apple do n't make the same mistake i did
i liked the iaudio but 8 months after buying it it no longer plays in stereo and the voice record work cowon 's website is the worst customer service i 've ever experienced in my life ! you ca n't submit a question unless you log in but they wo n't let you log in because every address you type in they say already used '' which is an error because i used addresses that were brand new cowon is too cheap to provide the support needed for their products i would never buy from them again
one of them arrived damaged on the printer head so did not even print one page the other one did not print as many pages as i 'd expected besides the color fades away too fast contacted the company without any reply you 'd better go for the genuine hp product
ordered on the of august has n't even shipped yet
nowhere in the description does it mention what ipods are compatible with this charger i assumed the charger would work with all ipods but it does n't fit the new ipods
i 'm very surprise as to how poorly this prodcut was made picture quality is horrible especially when it 's an upconvert player to 1080. when i switch the 480 to 1080 almost no difference the response time is unreal i can finish dinner before the tray opens the recording feature is horrible sometime it accepts disc but most of the time it has the bad error waste of mone
i have the if you look at the reviews of that model i have most of the problems with that model there is a firmware upgrade available but sometimes it still refuses to use dvd disks and sometimes for no reason at all it decides for some reason not to record something however i like many of the features such as pause live tv simultaneous play and record the ability to use double side ram cartridges i have never had a problem with the ones made from maxell and also at the highest quality setting i have made finalized them and it has worked in all the dvd players i have tried i also have an older pioneer dvd model which is probably the best of all of them except for this and if you do this the sometimes do not work in other players onto the i have just bought these for both my sister and my mother as xmas presents but i had no idea they would have dropped simultaneous play and record i think a lot of the cheaper dvd recorders do not have this but the better models all do it also does not have either the onscreen guide which may be a blessing nor as it says on the website as far as i can tell the picture quality is actually very good perhaps because it has a digital tuner i really am not sure why as i only have it hooked up to the tv with the rca cables it seems better than the by the way for some strange reason you can not use component cables from a to a newer toshiba crt tv as the tv wants something called colorstream componnent cables and the does not use these i am not sure about the but some of the newest upconverting dvd players made by toshia do have colorstream component cables at any rate i will take two of these back and get the panasonic 25 model i would have bought a pioneer model instead but according to their website the only dvd recorder they make right now is one with a hard drive although i may purchase one for myself at a future time despite the missing hdmi output or dv input i can not afford two of these as gifts i hope this was helpful alex maas
i 've barely had this unit 6 months and now all of a sudden it does n't recognize any new disks for recording !
this shredder is ok if you have 3 sheets to shred once a week you can not shred sheet repeatedly it clogs up and is very hard to operate
